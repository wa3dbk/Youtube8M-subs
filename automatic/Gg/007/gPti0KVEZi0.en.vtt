by tightening the glutes you know most

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.510 
by tightening the glutes you know most
of<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.690> tightness<00:00:35.230> in<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.500> hips<00:00:35.770> comes<00:00:36.190> from

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
of the tightness in the hips comes from

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.000 
of the tightness in the hips comes from
weak<00:00:36.879> glutes<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:37.899> by<00:00:38.260> focusing<00:00:38.590> on<00:00:38.739> glute

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
weak glutes so by focusing on glute

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.229 
weak glutes so by focusing on glute
activation<00:00:39.160> that'll<00:00:39.879> be<00:00:39.969> more<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.180> a

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
activation that'll be more of a

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.270 
activation that'll be more of a
long-term<00:00:40.480> solution<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:41.320> open<00:00:41.590> up<00:00:41.710> your<00:00:41.860> your
