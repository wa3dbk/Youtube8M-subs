Angel here she has a scar on her chest

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.900 
Angel here she has a scar on her chest
that<00:00:12.490> was<00:00:13.350> that<00:00:14.350> happened<00:00:14.830> after<00:00:15.010> she<00:00:15.190> had<00:00:15.610> a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
that was that happened after she had a

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.910 
that was that happened after she had a
basal<00:00:16.360> cell<00:00:16.540> carcinoma<00:00:17.110> which<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.590> a<00:00:17.620> skin

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
basal cell carcinoma which is a skin

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.800 
basal cell carcinoma which is a skin
cancer<00:00:18.130> removed<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:18.970> we're<00:00:19.480> going<00:00:19.600> to<00:00:19.660> be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
cancer removed and we're going to be

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.710 
cancer removed and we're going to be
using<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.320> fractional<00:00:20.830> co2<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:22.090> blend<00:00:22.420> in<00:00:22.600> the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
using the fractional co2 to blend in the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.590 
using the fractional co2 to blend in the
scar<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.380> decrease<00:00:23.920> its<00:00:24.130> appearance<00:00:24.520> so<00:00:25.420> this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
scar and decrease its appearance so this

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.080 
scar and decrease its appearance so this
is<00:00:25.750> her<00:00:25.900> second<00:00:26.350> treatment<00:00:26.680> she's<00:00:27.670> had<00:00:27.850> one

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
is her second treatment she's had one

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.380 
is her second treatment she's had one
before<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:29.020> how<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.890> fractional<00:00:30.550> co2<00:00:30.760> works

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
before and how the fractional co2 works

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.489 
before and how the fractional co2 works
is<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:32.289> burns<00:00:33.100> our<00:00:33.640> drills<00:00:34.059> holes<00:00:34.480> into<00:00:35.469> the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
is it burns our drills holes into the

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.169 
is it burns our drills holes into the
skin<00:00:36.510> every<00:00:37.510> other<00:00:37.659> spot<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.499> as<00:00:39.339> the<00:00:39.760> skin

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
skin every other spot and as the skin

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.430 
skin every other spot and as the skin
and<00:00:40.479> the<00:00:40.780> scar<00:00:41.170> heels<00:00:42.069> it<00:00:42.339> blends<00:00:43.179> and<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
and the scar heels it blends and it

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.750 
and the scar heels it blends and it
becomes<00:00:44.769> less<00:00:45.159> noticeable<00:00:45.789> to<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.329> eye<00:00:46.679> so<00:00:47.760> we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
becomes less noticeable to the eye so we

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.180 
becomes less noticeable to the eye so we
use<00:00:48.999> the<00:00:49.239> fractional<00:00:49.780> co2<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.499> treat<00:00:50.739> scars

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
use the fractional co2 to treat scars

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.959 
use the fractional co2 to treat scars
acne<00:00:52.030> scars<00:00:52.749> on<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.170> face<00:00:53.440> we<00:00:54.370> can<00:00:54.549> use<00:00:54.579> it<00:00:54.850> to

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
acne scars on the face we can use it to

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.139 
acne scars on the face we can use it to
treat<00:00:55.210> stretch<00:00:55.539> marks<00:00:55.569> and<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:57.280> also<00:00:57.489> use<00:00:57.940> it

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
treat stretch marks and we also use it

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.270 
treat stretch marks and we also use it
to<00:00:58.179> tighten<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.019> treat<00:00:59.469> wrinkles<00:00:59.769> on<00:01:00.219> the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
to tighten and treat wrinkles on the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
again now angel tell us how was the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.740 
again now angel tell us how was the
treatment<00:01:47.560> for<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.829> did<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.130> hurt<00:01:48.310> no<00:01:48.939> okay

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
treatment for you did it hurt no okay

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.260 
treatment for you did it hurt no okay
pain-free<00:01:50.170> okay<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.130> generally<00:01:51.820> what<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.030> do

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
pain-free okay so generally what we do

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.080 
pain-free okay so generally what we do
is<00:01:52.390> we<00:01:52.539> have<00:01:52.689> people<00:01:52.869> keep<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.350> moist<00:01:53.939> it'll<00:01:54.939> be

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
is we have people keep it moist it'll be

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.419 
is we have people keep it moist it'll be
kind<00:01:55.299> of<00:01:55.360> oozy<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:56.140> three<00:01:56.740> days<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.340> week

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
kind of oozy for three days to a week

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.149 
kind of oozy for three days to a week
and<00:01:57.970> then<00:01:58.049> we'll<00:01:59.049> see<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.319> peak<00:01:59.530> results<00:02:00.039> at

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
and then we'll see the peak results at

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.910 
and then we'll see the peak results at
about<00:02:00.369> two<00:02:00.579> months<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.119> we<00:02:01.479> recommend<00:02:01.920> maybe

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
about two months and we recommend maybe

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.490 
about two months and we recommend maybe
two<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:04.119> four<00:02:04.420> treatments<00:02:04.990> for<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:05.319> all

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
two to four treatments for this all

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.889 
two to four treatments for this all
together<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.670> really<00:02:07.000> blend<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.600> scar

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
together to to really blend in the scar

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.030 
together to to really blend in the scar
so<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.970> have<00:02:10.179> any<00:02:10.390> questions<00:02:10.929> about<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
so if you have any questions about the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.890 
so if you have any questions about the
fractional<00:02:12.519> co2<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.239> we<00:02:13.360> use<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.690> treat

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
fractional co2 that we use to treat

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.130 
fractional co2 that we use to treat
stretch<00:02:14.290> marks<00:02:14.580> scars<00:02:15.580> acne<00:02:16.209> scars<00:02:16.810> are

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
