 I bring you the myth number 59 in whites 1 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 the zombies on the map of five and good is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 a pretty special myth to say it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 well since they are several parts worth is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.199
 like a little plot is worth it as 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.960
 you are looking at the nova tanks 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.080
 6 so you do not know it is a gas that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.989
 mortal is worth it is very important in what 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.879
 which is the campaign of black ops 1 is worth 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 that quite referenced on 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 new a6 good there's a story and what 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.540
 weird is finding us here in zombies 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 on the five map that has a lot that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.580
 see with the story is worth the fire map 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 you know that the characters of five 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.830
 they came out also in campaign mode has 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.030
 it has quite a relationship is worth what 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.939
 we had not noticed that here 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 were these tanks worth and are 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.039
 pretty important that are here worth 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 you already have your logic and good is 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.190
 say that my cousin said 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.470
 that he had found some notes 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.350
 secret and that those secret notes of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.540
 shield they took to something other than good 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.570
 what he was saying is that behind the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.130
 new a6 were the iluminatis vale 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 well what's up with these secret notes here 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.140
 As you are going to see they are good, they are several 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 notes worth here we are in the room where 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.580
 it is given to electricity as you see 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.680
 here on the wall there is a poster that you can 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.880
 so to speak, it is worth 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.550
 quite a site on the map that is the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.410
 new a6 gas formula is worth it since 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.300
 just below as you are seeing no 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.610
 it looks very good you see the note of the gnome 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.729
 This better jubilation already taught in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.110
 another map a while ago it now 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.630
 you are going to see the future image of what 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.570
 I taught was worth this was from these images 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.950
 of kim or the totem is worth the same 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.500
 the same gnome note joys that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.780
 it meant I do not remember it well but it was 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.610
 something I do not know what to shut up 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.959
 or something like that I do not remember I'll put it out there 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.510
 on the screen because I do not remember the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.700
 translation and this was here do not see 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.380
 totem and good as you have also seen 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.750
 we have found them in five 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.489
 but the curious thing does not come here the curious 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.020
 it comes that now in this lectern here 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.030
 that we have it in front of the nose 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.100
 all this time I did not even have 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.440
 fixed as you see here it returns again to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.870
 be this word is worth it is like a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 indirectly so to speak, and that there is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.590
 right next to it just 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.000
 we have another one of the secret notes me 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.000
 I think I would say that the most important 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.770
 it is the one that is below the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.070
 formula of the new a6 that if you look 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.570
 well if you look good there are people 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.430
 that will say it's a pyramid but not in 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.890
 reality is the symbol of the Illuminati 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 vale is a pyramid with an eye at the end 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.850
 it's good for people who do not know one the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.730
 Illuminati is a secret society and 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 it has a lot to do with him he is not going to 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.880
 six as you are watching is very curious 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.580
 that is the formula of 96 and below are 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.900
 just what is the role of this 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.120
 the illuminati not the symbol of the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.830
 illuminati and right next to it is the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.570
 indirectly that of not retiring but that 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.890
 that does not stay the one that is shut up or something 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.510
 so as I said I did not 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.190
 I'll leave out there these are the notes 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.630
 secrets is how you are seeing they are 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.600
 these three where I was down at the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.459
 where the phone was worth the light and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.740
 say that that is very curious and that is a 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.670
 myth totally true if they are 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.650
 you believe you are here and if you have to see 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.690
 the Illuminati with the formula of 96 or 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.490
 with the 96 in the campaign or in the zombies 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.810
 or whatever it is here you have an image and 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.820
 nothing is simply this saying that it is a 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.830
 myth totally true a myth somewhat 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.640
 in special quotes and nothing I hope 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.320
 that you liked it if you liked it 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.850
 ride I like and favorites and see you 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.850
 the next video only two to all
