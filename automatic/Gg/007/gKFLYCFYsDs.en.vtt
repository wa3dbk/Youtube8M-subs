00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.880
 first of all we take our cookies 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.070
 of crowd that we have set to cool 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.929
 tare needs 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.789
 8 pastry rings as they say in slang 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.369
 professional with whom we have 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.680
 cut out our crowd cookie 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.200
 because we're going to cut out pasta 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.329
 of sugar the same shape we take 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.990
 the little bag with cornstarch were 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.730
 on stage to be able to spread under the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.170
 sugar paste so that the vast 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.760
 into, however, the plan of is not attached 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 work 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.199
 once this is done we cut the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.199
 our heart 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.270
 and in this case we have recreated the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.129
 texture of the ferrÃ¨ wrapping 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.829
 knowledge then we try to 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.970
 reproduce it on the sugar paste 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.550
 same effect 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 we rubbed and the cat 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:13.880
 aluminum where above we start to impress 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.159
 between states I will look and here we have 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.830
 in the drawer 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.550
 we take water where the simple 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.550
 water the names we give the back of the heart 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:36.119
 and we stick on the cookie made this 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.119
 we keep food gold powder 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.320
 we sign with water 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.740
 and with a small brush we go to color 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.970
 the biscuit we have just de-corato 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.939
 we can alcohol because water 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.640
 wait to evaporate very quickly and 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.270
 so it's not going to ruin the structure 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.270
 of sugar paste 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.220
 and with the heart and we proceed to the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.150
 realization of the hinged buoy that 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.150
 finishes the biscuit 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.700
 and we talk to you if with the strips 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.750
 fall to churn out the omelette more than two 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.440
 pages that form 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.440
 yellow 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.030
 in Italy 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.650
 then we take our strips and 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.390
 let's say a little to the base of this 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.390
 way and we ask for it 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.540
 the man is prey to the maximum with a point 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.580
 from saturday shabbat big enough wave 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.920
 and let's cut that then 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.920
 will become the label 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.780
 welcome 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.850
 we press slightly more gold 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.800
 clear but only powdered in this case 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.190
 we don't say with alcohol it's because of us 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.460
 it only serves to give the effect of silk ribbon 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.990
 on the mouth and we go to 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.990
 dust lightly
