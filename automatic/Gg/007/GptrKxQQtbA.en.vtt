00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 So a small release of the transfer of the Soviet 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.010
 rock and roll spare parts picard 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.400
 here he is picard maybe say to me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 what I want to do is a bad publicity or 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 Well, well, in short, so it was bought 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.739
 in Ukraine can be 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.329
 really dagi not that terrible fake 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.510
 particular it comes for the oil pump on 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.920
 cars gas i have four rather u 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.989
 im for 417 but on you we will now put 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.809
 here is just one paw she is not so 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.660
 In short, I want to note here 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 Please, this is a new pump 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:07.170
 to the surface of course there is normal but 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.030
 this one's Liu gears he kills 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.049
 all the good things that might be here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 055 chip measured the gap even on the Lada 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.430
 they admit it have a limit as it were in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 050 admission there but this is a complete break 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.369
 and so it should be 025 of these within 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.460
 but this is why this new 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.189
 put it on the engine firstly 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 second he was assembled 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.960
 modern modern let's say bolts 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 hexagon but they stood on 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.450
 thread lock washers and so the rover 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 the question is why put the washer and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.579
 still on the retainer life you can then 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.230
 thread on plucks in this in aluminum 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.390
 housing 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.920
 so it stays off screen that is 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.360
 it is not known what and why this principle 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 casting 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.480
 well neat and said something to me 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.860
 bad well in short but because it is she can 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.700
 not bad but I put such a pump 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.890
 I definitely do not recommend it to anyone like this 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.250
 looks like an oil pump gas production but 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.320
 Of course I want to show you the gaps 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.460
 that is, we rubber you can of course 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.090
 say that there is oil on it here this 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.830
 Here solidoid therefore the gap is small but I 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.220
 here 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.880
 I put the probes into the probe 025 here 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.730
 barely leafing through in this regard from 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.730
 superfluous but of course the surface is not so 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.050
 smoothly and he basically that is 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.200
 some, and beyond the notch, too, no 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.030
 assembly of course this pump is just 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 impressive well first 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.150
 let's start with my loved ones with these ponytails 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.000
 contrio 7 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 firstly they were not tightened we 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.640
 tails is of course something cruel 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:22.040
 also pay attention to here it is cloud 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.500
 grease as it was all collected 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.650
 This product is truly worthy of the heading 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.800
 Soviet rock and roll stand on it 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.750
 pads unlike chinese 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.739
 products in what laying here two pieces 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.020
 here is one of them and here it is on on on on on 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.440
 on on on on on on on on on on shorter view 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.220
 looking for something which is not here a piece of gasket 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.690
 do not understand 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.750
 wow 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 there really is no piece of gasket i.e. those 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.280
 how to make out she just thought 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.260
 torn this laying here piece 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.709
 no laying okay it's my business 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.170
 fix well that's really truly 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.780
 soviet rock n roll such a pump when 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.940
 receipt of purchase 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.850
 or acquisitions but if someone you 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.180
 give just put on the engine 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.180
 I highly recommend because it Well 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.579
 this one here is the whole body solidoid here disassembled 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.650
 maybe not visible now i will try 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.480
 show you here here salute i mean i 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.810
 I live just made out on newspapers he 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.810
 you see 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:40.390
 there are some type of metal blotches 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:42.940
 chips there or fuck understand what's she 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.030
 not on the finger well shorter that is from 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.910
 storage time here this example us 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.070
 here different dust he gets on the tooth 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.130
 there is not, I introduced her to some 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.230
 up could make just that i took it apart 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.360
 but maybe something came apart during disassembly 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.400
 although it is very, very unlikely pump 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.530
 before installation on the car and 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.530
 Naturally you need to completely disassemble 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.300
 clean up completely 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.660
 this is a goal and $ all all all all all 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.940
 check the gaskets so that they are not 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.570
 torn off and the seeds themselves with good but 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.880
 assembly vyazovskaya but it's just soviet 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.630
 rock and roll in one word neither more nor 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.990
 less this in sight sleepy valve also 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.729
 I want to note here it is a mesh but it 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.710
 here only a part of the grid is closed 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.900
 you leave yourself to be closed more 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.150
 you will wind the queens to wind 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.870
 do not understand what the system is not filled 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.080
 But why should it be filled if 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.140
 the grid here will be closed in general 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.140
 in short, such are the good workmanship 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.539
 I repeat the quality is quite good 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.660
 of course compared to the Chinese 67 this 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.070
 clearance is all but assembly compared to 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.340
 China China even it is assembled 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.700
 attractive this one assembled awful this 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.260
 there was a Soviet rock and roll program on 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.260
 thank you all for your attention
