00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.769

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.620

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.860

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.059
 will stay 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 this way in the editing part here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.920
 above the preview of the game below and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 He already divided here on the side. 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.570
 Now to let the same as I do I 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 I get the foot of the project part I 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.519
 I'm going to drag it down or up 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.950
 fit down here the ready fit 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.250
 here below and there is no adjustment here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.080
 To make it better, so here it is. 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.220
 the elements and here below will be 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.280
 our objects let only one import 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.040
 something here just so you can see 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.500
 which is still different from the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.939
 that I use because you supported him and see 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.369
 appearing the items here it appears 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.860
 Underneath how do I do this I click 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.680
 here in these small arrows here and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.689
 layout column ready and then it goes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.229
 to stay that way right here then when 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.420
 People create the paste right when people 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.329
 I wanted some pastry and drag the items to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.579
 they will appear in this way 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.530
 It's how I've used it in the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.420
 video lessons so if you have interest 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.820
 to make it easier to follow 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.369
 Just like I'm doing, right? 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.829
 one more important detail to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.350
 Monitor the project you 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.079
 It's giving error, I came here on windows. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.700
 and you'll get it here, there's more 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.689
 two things that I use that is the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 food 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.959
 so I'm going to stay here on food he goes 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.220
 open here and I'll drag you down 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.620
 here where I want 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.900
 and we will also windows here 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.409
 of a wink here on my stone screen 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.420
 is poor contact in my car a moment 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:27.900
 cable 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.580
 let's see who deserves returned is the other 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.120
 thing that did not ask us will also 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.579
 catch the animation window that is here and 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.260
 Are you going to do the same thing? 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.150
 appear somewhere and we're going to 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.159
 drag it down here in the then 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.840
 animation animator that we will see 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.480
 in the future how to work with it here 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.480
 It is also the last window that people 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.370
 Okay, it's the console guys so you 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.980
 go here the windows will get the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.599
 console is not mine it's opening in 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.620
 another window works with two 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.299
 monitors 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.450
 There you will drag and they will put it 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.640
 down here in the aac because we use the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.409
 console here because any error that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.750
 in our script when people 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.840
 are working there he already appears 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.299
 here we can already see there 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.799
