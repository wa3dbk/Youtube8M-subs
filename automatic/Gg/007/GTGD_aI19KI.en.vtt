00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
gaming I wear vans gaming eyewear so if

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.290 
gaming I wear vans gaming eyewear so if
it's<00:00:23.070> nice<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> comfortable<00:00:23.939> underneath

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it's nice and comfortable underneath

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.980 
it's nice and comfortable underneath
your<00:00:24.510> headset<00:00:25.849> your<00:00:26.849> place<00:00:27.119> displacement

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
your headset your place displacement

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.570 
your headset your place displacement
pressure<00:00:28.230> points<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.890> doesn't<00:00:29.310> build<00:00:29.460> up

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
pressure points so it doesn't build up

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150 
pressure points so it doesn't build up
any<00:00:29.760> pressure<00:00:30.000> around<00:00:30.300> your<00:00:30.539> ears<00:00:30.720> ok<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
any pressure around your ears ok and the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
any pressure around your ears ok and the
coolest<00:00:32.460> thing<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.540> real

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
coolest thing about it is it's it's real

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
coolest thing about it is it's it's real
nice<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> tight<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.649> your<00:00:34.739> eyes<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.309> build

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
nice and tight to your eyes so you build

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
nice and tight to your eyes so you build
up<00:00:35.790> humidity<00:00:36.660> around<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:37.050> eyes<00:00:37.140> where<00:00:37.800> they

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
up humidity around your eyes where they

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.560 
up humidity around your eyes where they
don't<00:00:38.070> dry<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.239> you're<00:00:39.360> playing

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
don't dry out so when you're playing

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
don't dry out so when you're playing
those<00:00:39.780> five<00:00:40.050> six<00:00:40.469> hour<00:00:40.620> marathon<00:00:40.920> session

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
those five six hour marathon session

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
those five six hour marathon session
your<00:00:42.390> eyes<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:42.780> feel<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> fatigue

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
your eyes don't feel all the fatigue

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.889 
your eyes don't feel all the fatigue
you'll<00:00:44.520> notice<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> look<00:00:45.719> through

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you'll notice so if you look through

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
you'll notice so if you look through
there<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> yellow<00:00:47.640> tint<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
there a little bit of a yellow tint the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
there a little bit of a yellow tint the
yellow<00:00:48.450> kit<00:00:48.780> lens<00:00:49.020> tint<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> skews<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
yellow kit lens tint kind of skews that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
yellow kit lens tint kind of skews that
color<00:00:50.879> spectrum<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.690> warmer<00:00:52.140> part<00:00:52.410> where

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
color spectrum to the warmer part where

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
color spectrum to the warmer part where
your<00:00:53.160> eye<00:00:53.190> doesn't<00:00:53.579> work<00:00:53.850> quite<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.149> hard<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
your eye doesn't work quite so hard and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
your eye doesn't work quite so hard and
then<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:55.860> cool<00:00:56.219> thing<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.489> maybe<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
then the other cool thing is maybe you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.200 
then the other cool thing is maybe you
can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> there's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
can see it is there's a little bit of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
can see it is there's a little bit of
anti-reflective<00:01:00.210> coating<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
anti-reflective coating on there if you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
anti-reflective coating on there if you
can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.129> purple<00:01:02.730> reflective<00:01:03.329> glare

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
can see that purple reflective glare

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
can see that purple reflective glare
that<00:01:04.010> cuts<00:01:05.010> down<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> glare<00:01:05.760> off<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that cuts down all the glare off the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
that cuts down all the glare off the
screen<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.560> diffuses<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> lot<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
screen and diffuses a lot of that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
screen and diffuses a lot of that
reflective<00:01:09.150> light<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> basically<00:01:11.159> there's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
reflective light so basically there's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.550 
reflective light so basically there's
about<00:01:11.430> four<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:11.729> five<00:01:11.820> main<00:01:12.240> points<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.320> lens

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
about four or five main points the lens

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.240 
about four or five main points the lens
material<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.939> lens<00:01:15.150> coatings<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.650> lens

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
material the lens coatings the lens

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.200 
material the lens coatings the lens
actual<00:01:18.700> geometry<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.960> then<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.920> lens<00:01:21.790> tint

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
actual geometry and then the lens tint

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.020 
actual geometry and then the lens tint
so<00:01:22.960> all<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.320> basically<00:01:24.250> reduces<00:01:24.880> eye

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
so all of that basically reduces eye

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.760 
so all of that basically reduces eye
fatigue<00:01:25.390> when<00:01:25.960> you're<00:01:26.110> playing<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.620> the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
fatigue when you're playing on the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.530 
fatigue when you're playing on the
computer<00:01:26.860> for<00:01:27.220> long<00:01:27.610> periods<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:28.090> time<00:01:28.150> or

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
computer for long periods of time or

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.810 
computer for long periods of time or
playing<00:01:28.720> non<00:01:28.990> soul<00:01:29.229> games<00:01:29.470> or<00:01:30.250> if<00:01:30.430> even<00:01:30.729> if

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
playing non soul games or if even if

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.520 
playing non soul games or if even if
you're<00:01:30.940> just<00:01:31.060> working<00:01:31.300> all<00:01:31.570> day<00:01:31.600> long<00:01:31.930> and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
you're just working all day long and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.890 
you're just working all day long and
your<00:01:32.650> eyes<00:01:32.800> start<00:01:33.040> building<00:01:33.400> up<00:01:33.460> Appetit<00:01:34.000> this

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
your eyes start building up Appetit this

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.320 
your eyes start building up Appetit this
is<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.380> very<00:01:35.590> soon<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.160> i<00:01:36.729> would<00:01:37.150> say

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
is this is very soon and i would say

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.880 
is this is very soon and i would say
sort<00:01:37.660> of<00:01:37.750> different<00:01:38.140> but<00:01:38.260> i<00:01:38.290> guess<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.710> know

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
sort of different but i guess you know

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.290 
sort of different but i guess you know
Triton's<00:01:39.670> looking<00:01:39.940> at<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.150> whole

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
Triton's looking at the whole

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.990 
Triton's looking at the whole
