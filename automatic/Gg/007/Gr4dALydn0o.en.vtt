00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.530 
in turn drive the fan and the two
compressors<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.700> air<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.090> expelled

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
compressors the air is then expelled

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.810 
compressors the air is then expelled
through<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.020> primary<00:02:45.440> duct<00:02:45.740> joining<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.700> air

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
through the primary duct joining the air

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.250 
through the primary duct joining the air
from<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.209> fan<00:02:47.360> stream<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:49.780> turbofan<00:02:50.780> is

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
from the fan stream a turbofan is

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.310 
from the fan stream a turbofan is
therefore<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.709> flow<00:02:52.040> cycle<00:02:52.730> engine<00:02:53.180> air<00:02:54.020> is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
therefore a flow cycle engine air is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.500 
therefore a flow cycle engine air is
compressed<00:02:54.800> then<00:02:55.250> heated<00:02:55.700> by<00:02:55.880> burning<00:02:55.910> fuel

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
compressed then heated by burning fuel

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.390 
compressed then heated by burning fuel
after<00:02:57.380> which<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.680> passes<00:02:57.890> through<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
after which it passes through the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.580 
after which it passes through the
turbines<00:02:58.850> which<00:02:59.390> drive<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> compressors<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
turbines which drive the compressors and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.980 
turbines which drive the compressors and
the<00:03:00.920> fan

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
the fan

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:16.870 
the fan
