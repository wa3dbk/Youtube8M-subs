character in that game as well and the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.230 
character in that game as well and the
grand<00:01:03.120> total<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.470> shy<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> double<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.640> 308

now<00:01:07.020> apparently<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> Gamecube<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.490> render

now apparently the Gamecube can render

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
now apparently the Gamecube can render
roughly<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> hundred<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.260> twenty-eight

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
roughly a hundred and twenty-eight

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.980 
roughly a hundred and twenty-eight
characters<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.310> screen<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> same<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.450> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
characters on screen at the same time so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
characters on screen at the same time so
I<00:01:13.020> find<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> hard<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.520> believe<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
I find it kind of hard to believe that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
I find it kind of hard to believe that
they<00:01:15.509> capped<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> total<00:01:16.470> character<00:01:16.890> limit<00:01:17.159> at

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
they capped the total character limit at

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
they capped the total character limit at
308<00:01:17.820> due<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> technical<00:01:18.780> limitations

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
308 due to technical limitations
