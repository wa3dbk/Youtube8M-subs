00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
compression I want to talk about

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.360 
compression I want to talk about
comparison<00:00:09.110> videos<00:00:09.500> and<00:00:09.679> how<00:00:09.769> they<00:00:09.919> really

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
comparison videos and how they really

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.239 
comparison videos and how they really
don't<00:00:10.610> make<00:00:10.940> sense<00:00:11.240> on<00:00:11.540> YouTube<00:00:12.110> I<00:00:12.349> see<00:00:13.009> a<00:00:13.040> lot

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:13.249 
don't make sense on YouTube I see a lot

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.770 
don't make sense on YouTube I see a lot
of<00:00:13.280> videos<00:00:13.459> where<00:00:13.879> people<00:00:13.910> are<00:00:14.209> comparing

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
of videos where people are comparing

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.610 
of videos where people are comparing
PlayStation<00:00:15.440> 4<00:00:15.620> games<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:16.129> Xbox<00:00:16.520> one<00:00:16.820> games<00:00:17.120> or

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
PlayStation 4 games to Xbox one games or

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.890 
PlayStation 4 games to Xbox one games or
PC<00:00:18.620> games<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.190> Xbox<00:00:19.640> one<00:00:19.910> or<00:00:20.150> PlayStation<00:00:20.690> 4

PC games to Xbox one or PlayStation 4

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.930 
PC games to Xbox one or PlayStation 4
games<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.440> it<00:00:21.920> really<00:00:22.100> blows<00:00:22.340> my<00:00:22.550> mind<00:00:22.790> that

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
games and it really blows my mind that

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.730 
games and it really blows my mind that
people<00:00:23.180> see<00:00:23.390> these<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.870> think<00:00:24.110> it's<00:00:24.260> real<00:00:24.470> and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
people see these and think it's real and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.100 
people see these and think it's real and
think<00:00:25.010> that<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:25.370> is<00:00:25.430> actually<00:00:26.240> how<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:26.750> game

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
think that this is actually how the game

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.460 
think that this is actually how the game
looks<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.740> that<00:00:28.340> is<00:00:28.400> absolutely<00:00:28.990> not<00:00:29.990> how<00:00:30.260> it

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
looks and that is absolutely not how it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.409 
looks and that is absolutely not how it
is<00:00:30.620> and<00:00:31.070> I<00:00:31.400> get<00:00:31.610> what<00:00:31.760> these<00:00:31.880> channels<00:00:32.300> are

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
is and I get what these channels are

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.300 
is and I get what these channels are
trying<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.780> do<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:32.960> get<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:33.500> they're<00:00:33.680> actually

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
trying to do I get that they're actually

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.490 
trying to do I get that they're actually
trying<00:00:34.490> to<00:00:34.700> compare<00:00:35.090> these<00:00:35.270> but<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.810> have<00:00:36.350> to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
trying to compare these but you have to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.560 
trying to compare these but you have to
understand<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.430> best<00:00:37.670> way<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.030> compare

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
understand that the best way to compare

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.080 
understand that the best way to compare
these<00:00:38.750> would<00:00:39.020> be<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.410> upload<00:00:39.920> RAW<00:00:40.220> files<00:00:40.640> and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
these would be to upload RAW files and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.840 
these would be to upload RAW files and
even<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:41.630> if<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.350> upload<00:00:42.800> RAW<00:00:43.100> files<00:00:43.460> for

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
even then if you upload RAW files for

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.790 
even then if you upload RAW files for
people<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.210> download<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.870> compare<00:00:45.290> it's

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
people to download and compare it's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.710 
people to download and compare it's
still<00:00:46.220> gonna<00:00:46.489> be<00:00:46.579> compressed<00:00:47.210> somewhat

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
still gonna be compressed somewhat

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.470 
still gonna be compressed somewhat
depending<00:00:48.230> on<00:00:48.350> what<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:48.770> used<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.520> record<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
depending on what you used to record the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.870 
depending on what you used to record the
footage<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.590> how<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.950> works<00:00:52.130> out<00:00:52.310> for<00:00:52.370> me<00:00:52.579> is<00:00:52.850> I

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
footage so how it works out for me is I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.780 
footage so how it works out for me is I
use<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.329> program<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:54.110> record<00:00:54.440> or<00:00:54.770> capture<00:00:55.550> card

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
use a program to record or capture card

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.970 
use a program to record or capture card
to<00:00:55.910> record<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:56.480> on<00:00:56.720> PC<00:00:57.200> normally<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.710> would<00:00:57.950> use

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
to record so on PC normally I would use

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.690 
to record so on PC normally I would use
shadowplay

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
shadowplay

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.880 
shadowplay
and<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.390> console<00:00:59.899> I<00:00:59.930> would<00:01:00.170> normally<00:01:00.559> use<00:01:00.590> an

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
and on console I would normally use an

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.220 
and on console I would normally use an
elgato<00:01:01.040> when<00:01:01.970> you<00:01:02.120> capture<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.720> gameplay

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
elgato when you capture that gameplay

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.439 
elgato when you capture that gameplay
it's<00:01:03.350> compressed<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.429> lose<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.879> bit<00:01:05.420> of

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
it's compressed you lose a bit of

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.020 
it's compressed you lose a bit of
quality<00:01:05.749> through<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.799> capture<00:01:07.189> software<00:01:07.460> or

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
quality through the capture software or

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.940 
quality through the capture software or
hardware<00:01:08.569> so<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:09.530> use<00:01:09.560> whatever

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
hardware so then you use whatever

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.760 
hardware so then you use whatever
program<00:01:10.639> it<00:01:10.819> is<00:01:10.969> I<00:01:11.210> use<00:01:11.450> Sony<00:01:11.689> Vegas<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.499> add

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
program it is I use Sony Vegas to add

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.800 
program it is I use Sony Vegas to add
your<00:01:13.039> voice<00:01:13.249> edit<00:01:13.789> your<00:01:13.909> clips<00:01:14.210> whatever<00:01:14.659> it

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
your voice edit your clips whatever it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.879 
your voice edit your clips whatever it
is<00:01:14.960> um

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:15.889 
is um

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:18.429 
is um
you<00:01:16.130> use<00:01:16.399> that<00:01:16.639> program<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.389> then<00:01:17.899> you<00:01:18.020> render

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
you use that program and then you render

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.319 
you use that program and then you render
the<00:01:18.590> video<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:19.549> through<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.909> rendering

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
the video and then through the rendering

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.719 
the video and then through the rendering
process<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:21.200> lose<00:01:21.469> a<00:01:21.499> bunch<00:01:21.799> of<00:01:21.979> quality<00:01:22.490> too

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
process you lose a bunch of quality too

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.969 
process you lose a bunch of quality too
then<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.719> have<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.020> take<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.350> footage<00:01:24.679> which

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
then you have to take that footage which

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.800 
then you have to take that footage which
is<00:01:25.130> already<00:01:25.399> taking<00:01:25.789> a<00:01:25.880> hit<00:01:26.030> twice<00:01:26.359> when<00:01:26.719> it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
is already taking a hit twice when it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.989 
is already taking a hit twice when it
comes<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.170> quality<00:01:27.619> through<00:01:27.950> capturing<00:01:28.819> and

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
comes to quality through capturing and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:30.580 
comes to quality through capturing and
then<00:01:29.149> through<00:01:29.389> rendering<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.350> have<00:01:30.469> to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
then through rendering and you have to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.219 
then through rendering and you have to
upload<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.159> YouTube<00:01:31.310> where<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.420> gets<00:01:32.659> the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
upload it to YouTube where it gets the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.099 
upload it to YouTube where it gets the
most<00:01:33.880> compression<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.179> most<00:01:35.420> quality

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
most compression and the most quality

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.499 
most compression and the most quality
loss<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.829> I<00:01:37.340> don't<00:01:37.399> think<00:01:37.609> people<00:01:37.789> understand

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
loss and I don't think people understand

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.719 
loss and I don't think people understand
this<00:01:38.659> by<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.929> time<00:01:39.229> my<00:01:39.469> PC<00:01:40.069> game<00:01:40.310> play<00:01:40.520> because

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
this by the time my PC game play because

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.539 
this by the time my PC game play because
I<00:01:40.939> really<00:01:41.359> do<00:01:41.509> believe<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.859> more<00:01:43.069> detail

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
I really do believe that the more detail

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.399 
I really do believe that the more detail
the<00:01:43.759> more<00:01:43.909> high-quality<00:01:44.149> your<00:01:44.779> gameplay<00:01:45.170> is

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
the more high-quality your gameplay is

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.339 
the more high-quality your gameplay is
the<00:01:46.219> more<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:46.670> hit<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:46.999> takes<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.569> think<00:01:47.599> like

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
the more of a hit it takes I think like

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.800 
the more of a hit it takes I think like
console<00:01:49.279> games<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:49.939> stuff<00:01:50.119> like<00:01:50.329> that<00:01:50.569> are

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
console games and stuff like that are

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.949 
console games and stuff like that are
already<00:01:51.380> at<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.069> cap<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.149> think<00:01:53.840> the

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
already at this cap so I think the

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.359 
already at this cap so I think the
better<00:01:54.139> quality<00:01:54.649> gameplay<00:01:54.859> the<00:01:55.189> better

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
better quality gameplay the better

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.519 
better quality gameplay the better
looking<00:01:55.579> graphics<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:56.599> more<00:01:57.020> detailed

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
looking graphics and more detailed

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.589 
looking graphics and more detailed
looking<00:01:57.919> graphics<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.880> bigger<00:01:59.119> hit<00:01:59.419> you're

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
looking graphics the bigger hit you're

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.929 
looking graphics the bigger hit you're
gonna<00:01:59.749> take<00:02:00.109> and<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.979> isn't<00:02:01.310> some<00:02:01.490> PC

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
gonna take and this isn't some PC

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.519 
gonna take and this isn't some PC
master-race<00:02:02.389> crap<00:02:02.840> here<00:02:03.049> I'm<00:02:03.229> really

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
master-race crap here I'm really

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:05.559 
master-race crap here I'm really
genuinely<00:02:04.039> trying<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.579> explain<00:02:04.969> this<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.240> some

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
genuinely trying to explain this to some

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.469 
genuinely trying to explain this to some
people<00:02:05.899> who<00:02:06.079> obviously<00:02:07.009> don't<00:02:07.279> know<00:02:07.609> how<00:02:08.239> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
people who obviously don't know how this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.929 
people who obviously don't know how this
works<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.409> understand<00:02:10.159> why<00:02:10.310> people<00:02:10.369> game<00:02:10.789> on

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
works I do understand why people game on

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.610 
works I do understand why people game on
consoles<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.659> definitely<00:02:12.319> don't<00:02:12.500> think

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
consoles I definitely don't think

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.020 
consoles I definitely don't think
graphics<00:02:13.340> make<00:02:13.640> or

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
graphics make or

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.460 
graphics make or
rayko<00:02:14.180> game<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.750> don't<00:02:14.810> think<00:02:15.170> they're<00:02:15.320> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
rayko game I don't think they're the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.980 
rayko game I don't think they're the
most<00:02:15.770> important<00:02:16.490> thing<00:02:16.820> when<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.480> comes<00:02:17.600> to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
most important thing when it comes to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.050 
most important thing when it comes to
gaming<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.770> do<00:02:18.890> see<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> lot<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.490> videos<00:02:19.910> I

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
gaming but I do see a lot of videos I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.150 
gaming but I do see a lot of videos I
look<00:02:20.270> at<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> comments<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.500> Grand<00:02:22.010> Theft

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
look at the comments of the Grand Theft

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.700 
look at the comments of the Grand Theft
Auto<00:02:22.370> 5<00:02:22.730> PC<00:02:23.270> gameplay<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.990> people<00:02:24.230> say<00:02:24.440> it

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
Auto 5 PC gameplay and people say it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.190 
Auto 5 PC gameplay and people say it
looks<00:02:25.010> exactly<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.760> same<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.690> guess<00:02:26.930> after

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
looks exactly the same and I guess after

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.470 
looks exactly the same and I guess after
compression<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.280> after<00:02:28.670> all<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.970> stuff<00:02:29.270> it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
compression and after all that stuff it

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 
compression and after all that stuff it
really<00:02:29.690> does<00:02:30.050> look<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.350> same<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.860> that's<00:02:31.010> kind

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
really does look the same so that's kind

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.130 
really does look the same so that's kind
of<00:02:31.459> why<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.910> gonna<00:02:32.150> show<00:02:32.390> some<00:02:32.420> gameplay<00:02:33.020> in

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
of why I'm gonna show some gameplay in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.170 
of why I'm gonna show some gameplay in
the<00:02:33.230> background<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.310> video<00:02:34.550> that's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the background of this video that's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.050 
the background of this video that's
taken<00:02:35.750> with<00:02:35.959> my<00:02:36.170> phone<00:02:36.560> because<00:02:37.220> that's<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
taken with my phone because that's the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.080 
taken with my phone because that's the
best<00:02:38.330> way<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.630> can<00:02:39.050> figure<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:40.280> cut<00:02:40.610> out<00:02:40.820> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
best way I can figure to cut out the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.790 
best way I can figure to cut out the
middleman<00:02:41.480> you're<00:02:41.720> still<00:02:42.020> gonna<00:02:42.170> get<00:02:42.350> quality

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
middleman you're still gonna get quality

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.920 
middleman you're still gonna get quality
loss<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.760> still<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.480> render<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
loss because I still have to render the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.660 
loss because I still have to render the
video<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.410> still<00:02:45.770> have<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.130> upload<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.520> to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
video and I still have to upload it to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.790 
video and I still have to upload it to
YouTube<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.900> do<00:02:48.020> think<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.530> will<00:02:48.620> give

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
YouTube but I do think it will give

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.560 
YouTube but I do think it will give
people<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.310> better<00:02:49.459> understanding<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.420> how

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
people a better understanding of how

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.470 
people a better understanding of how
Grand<00:02:50.870> Theft<00:02:51.020> Auto<00:02:51.200> 5<00:02:51.530> actually<00:02:51.830> looks<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.940> PC

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
Grand Theft Auto 5 actually looks on PC

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.030 
Grand Theft Auto 5 actually looks on PC
because<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:54.140> mind-blowing<00:02:54.680> it's

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
because it's mind-blowing it's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.250 
because it's mind-blowing it's
mind-boggling<00:02:55.670> how<00:02:55.970> good<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.660> game<00:02:56.930> looks

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
mind-boggling how good this game looks

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.160 
mind-boggling how good this game looks
and<00:02:57.560> when<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.070> said<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.820> meant<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.540> just

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
and when I said that I meant it and just

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.290 
and when I said that I meant it and just
like<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.590> said<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.400> video<00:03:01.610> where<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> talked

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
like I said in that video where I talked

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.780 
like I said in that video where I talked
about<00:03:02.390> grand<00:03:02.750> theft<00:03:02.810> auto<00:03:03.080> 5<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.739> said<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.580> not

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
about grand theft auto 5 I said it's not

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.460 
about grand theft auto 5 I said it's not
a<00:03:04.850> different<00:03:05.300> game<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.720> still<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.230> same

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
a different game it's still the same

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.830 
a different game it's still the same
game<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.220> better<00:03:07.400> graphics<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.570> few

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
game it's just better graphics and a few

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.770 
game it's just better graphics and a few
extra<00:03:09.320> additions<00:03:09.890> for<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.280> PC<00:03:10.640> version<00:03:10.780> but

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
extra additions for the PC version but

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.110 
extra additions for the PC version but
to<00:03:11.930> be<00:03:12.080> absolutely<00:03:12.890> real<00:03:13.400> about<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.790> these

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
to be absolutely real about it these

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.150 
to be absolutely real about it these
comparison<00:03:14.810> videos<00:03:15.110> make<00:03:15.350> absolutely<00:03:16.010> no

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
comparison videos make absolutely no

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.310 
comparison videos make absolutely no
sense<00:03:16.310> because<00:03:16.640> by<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.060> end<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.570> compression

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
sense because by the end of compression

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.900 
sense because by the end of compression
and<00:03:18.470> rendering<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.310> all<00:03:19.459> this<00:03:19.640> other<00:03:19.820> stuff

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and rendering and all this other stuff

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.940 
and rendering and all this other stuff
you<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.420> do<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.720> your<00:03:20.810> footage<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.500> all

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
you have to do to your footage it all

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.039 
you have to do to your footage it all
looks<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.370> same<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.299> figured<00:03:23.630> it'd<00:03:23.690> be<00:03:23.810> kind

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
looks the same so I figured it'd be kind

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.660 
looks the same so I figured it'd be kind
