00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 from other kids to vÃ­ctor that this one exists 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 that back in 1 minecraft tutorial 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 and good what we are going to do today is going to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.840
 be installed install mods in make up 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.089
 I when good when I started with 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 I love you and I had no idea 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.170
 there were many tutorials how 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.880
 be mods but I was not clear 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.529
 I did not understand anything then what I 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 I want to do is going to be a tutorial that 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.490
 make a very easy tutorial very fast 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.580
 in the way that I would like me to 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.530
 had taught then what yes that 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.620
 I tell you is that you start from the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.180
 beginning and end it let's say you see 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.000
 all the video because if you can not 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.339
 lose and not only that however 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 there is some step the mein kapital was going to be 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.390
 a rollazo then fix it wrong then 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.500
 to grow more easily more 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.870
 simple but that works and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.400
 perfectly good and the only thing I want 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.220
 tell you is that I'm going to do it with the 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.440
 version 1.6 point 4 but it works with the 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.320
 version or let's say it's the same 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.920
 method for the 1.7 point version 2 and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.640
 for 1.8 it is also worth the only thing 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.830
 Of course, this has not come out 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.369
 come out still the minecraft force that is the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.990
 which makes the other mods compatible 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.729
 has come out by version 1.6 of point 2 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.200
 and as you already asked me and you have 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.060
 in front of those weapons because I'm going to 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.009
 come up with this but then when 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 leave the force force for the version that 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.720
 touch I will leave the link in the description 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.580
 interests of the same step but 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.189
 instead of downloading them download the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.890
 modes for the 1.6 point 4 os the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.150
 downloaded for 1.7 points very well 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.560
 Well, before all this said what 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.899
 let's do that it's going to be installed there 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.159
 sorry download the mods worth look 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.659
 we are going to download the tumen items that 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.369
 let's be here is worth the little things 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.680
 that you always see in all the videos of 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.110
 mods paris this here that you have 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.970
 you have the recipes you have it all are worth 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.439
 of all the blocks that you have what 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 we are going to do is download it for the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.939
 version that we want is worth as you see 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.000
 in the last one that has left is the 1.6 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.680
 point 4 and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.710
 I'm going to download playstation but 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.720
 obviously about 1.7 with all of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 the 1.8 other you can download for that 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 version and there will be no problem 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.500
 we give to jump advertising of the fly and already 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.510
 will not leave the file is this take and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.910
 trembled pointed hub in guard the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.830
 perfect file and then the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.600
 minecraft force that is from here and today 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.130
 left all the real webs 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.230
 rest assured that I will leave you there 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.230
 minecraft force we were to download the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.110
 of version 1.6 point 4 perfect and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.030
 we keep it as it is very simple 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.900
 it's worth adding these two modes 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.180
 I think I hope I can upload another video of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.620
 mods to install mods a little bit is a 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.980
 level a little harder but good 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.959
 which is not super difficult these are 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.090
 the much easier to install that's why 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.860
 to start to start with the topic 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.150
 let's use these vouches first thing 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.670
 what you have to do is run obviously 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.610
 in minecraft in version 1.6 point 4 or 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.489
 I repeat 1.7 point 2 if you are installing it 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.920
 at 1 point this 1.8 engine if it is 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.510
 doing with 1.8 oslo disco abbey 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.459
 jungle with the version that you are 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.190
 installing the mods and right now is the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.560
 1.6 point 4 you open it and jackie the game 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.180
 is already once we can only know 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.570
 what to do is install the minecraft force 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.470
 double click and our work a panel what 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.880
 we have the customer and it is of this 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.010
 let's say this address do not touch 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.250
 nothing is worth accepting 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.810
 if you had executed everything well and now 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.730
 this is worth downloading here the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.340
 Showcase libraries already going 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.170
 these are the motorcycle bookstores 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.120
 downloaded it will take nothing and you can see 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.190
 what my wifi as I always tell you is 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.019
 very slow but good then how is 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.730
 so slow and moment in video and a few 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.769
 seconds in good beige you will see me already 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.690
 perfect guys once you are already 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.180
 charged us will leave this box 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.950
 this dialogue is ok let's accept says 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.650
 that being perfect and what we are going to 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.379
 do now is going to be run minecraft 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.599
 it's worth dit profile today and here you have to 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.629
 select to lower low work of the whole 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.819
 what it says release 1 point 6.4 if you 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.340
 you have installed the 1.7 points or 1 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.040
 point 8.2 or whatever it is instead of 1.6 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.720
 point 4 will come out the version that you are 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.169
 installing the things we give to the play and 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.910
 now yes now let's say that a 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.049
 little eyelash of mods and now you see in a 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.419
 second you will see it is worth 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.400
 to see it run run 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.080
 it would take after giving a little more when 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.960
 have moche is normal because you have to 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.060
 load all modes then 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.500
 effectively indeed we have here 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
 the mods tab obviously where 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.669
 we have nothing alone these are the mods 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.590
 cord core mods that are called worth the 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.810
 mods that serve so that all the others 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.889
 work good once we have this what 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.740
 The only thing you have to do is leave 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:50.250
 minecraft install install already what 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.539
 comes to be our way is worth having as 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.919
 I said the twitter is very easy to 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.199
 use because that we only have 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.510
 that go to the downloads panel downloads 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.440
 here and execute it tumen items we execute 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.700
 and then we can take into account is that 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.650
 the version of minecraft force and the 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.540
 version of the too many team is the same 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.220
 if it's different obviously it's not going to 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.540
 operate several you have to have in 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.500
 account that not that the versions have 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.830
 to be the same so that everything 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:20.900
 work but nevertheless you can go 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.420
 updating the ones that one gives 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.380
 Oh sorry, what nonsense 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.910
 what nonsense to copy is the tumen items and 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.340
 now we do not have to go back to 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.810
 stay here is not worth it since I was here 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.810
 nobody anything to execute att data intro 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.440
 roaming let's aim minecraft we 're going to 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.800
 mods and here we paste the tumen Ã­tems vale 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.850
 control vy pegadÃ­simo that is now 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.400
 it should work correctly 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.470
 we go again to minecraft vale 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.360
 we open minecraft by the way if not 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.110
 you have this folder of mods is that not 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.930
 you have executed as I have told you 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.540
 minecraft with the profile of the force vale 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.360
 always assured is that the version is 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.370
 of the suisse forum that here puts force 9.11 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.350
 point 1 blah blah blah blah you have to be 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.760
 according to wheat sorry you have to be 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.710
 sure that you are running 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.590
 minecraft with these versions if you are not 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.390
 quite given a little problem is worth seeing 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.730
 if we have done well, I would have to leave 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.450
 already tumen Ã­tems and let's see what 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:26.330
 are your fans worth the most perfect sale and 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:30.020
 it comes out and it's okay, let's go to more, we can see 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.110
 that puts too many items 1.6 point 42 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.970
 singleplayer the select world and would have 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.389
 that work, I'm going to take a 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.129
 Simplicity the sensitivity to see where 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.129
 is sensitivity I put here is that 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.349
 you know what happens now it's worth how I'm 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:51.650
 playing with the pc and never because 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:54.620
 will end badly 12 ok if I the ol 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.910
 good thing is that I'm playing in a way 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.230
 that is not imagine I'm playing 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.700
 good 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:03.730
 and indeed we load the tumen items 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.380
 we are already perfectly good 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.790
 basically it was this ok this is the 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.190
 new version of your mind is so that no 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.460
 it opens up all creative adventurous way what 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.650
 of the rain I do not know what good so here 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.420
 You can see I'm taking everything 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.730
 so it works 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.070
 perfection if now or so I can 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.870
