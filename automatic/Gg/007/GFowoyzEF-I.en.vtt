00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.150
 and it all started so nice with one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 take a few stolen keys and a car 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.590
 for the pleasure that you only see the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.930
 owner of the car and the police there 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.580
 the humor of not in 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.560
 and if you are waiting for an intersection 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.560
 you don't have to expect compliments 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.890
 Oh 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.590
 actually the driver must already know 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.270
 that the end story is but there is one 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.290
 girl next to him so he goes for a while 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.290
 show how tough it is 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.240
 of course one of the ultimate forms 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.020
 of toughness ignoring one 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.020
 police stop sign 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.790
 and then the driver will show what 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.320
 he with a higher speed than any 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.530
 other driver and right-angle bend can 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.530
 to make 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.310
 yes not so yes and so bring you 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.870
 then the rest of the day 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.190
 at the police station 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.430
 there are owner of the car with the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.430
 blocks 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.360
 we 're getting married
