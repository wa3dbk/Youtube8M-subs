siege<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> map<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> people

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
siege is a map that a lot of people

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
siege is a map that a lot of people
think<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.840> boring<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.410> slow<00:00:40.530> paced

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
think is really boring and slow paced

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.530 
think is really boring and slow paced
but<00:00:41.250> once<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.640> learn<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> spawns<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
but once you learn the spawns and you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.630 
but once you learn the spawns and you
gain<00:00:42.780> proper<00:00:43.050> map<00:00:43.379> control<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.370> really

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
gain proper map control you could really

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
gain proper map control you could really
rack<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.270> ton<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.690> kills<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> map<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
rack up a ton of kills on this map and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.410 
rack up a ton of kills on this map and
it<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.829> extremely<00:00:47.370> fast-paced<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it can be extremely fast-paced for you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.080 
it can be extremely fast-paced for you
for<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> flag<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.129> seven<00:00:50.550> spawns<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
for the a flag we have seven spawns and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
for the a flag we have seven spawns and
these<00:00:51.899> spawns<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.379> behave<00:00:52.710> exactly<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.340> they

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
these spawns all behave exactly as they

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
these spawns all behave exactly as they
should<00:00:53.789> they're<00:00:54.629> anchored<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:55.170> teammates<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
should they're anchored by teammates and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
should they're anchored by teammates and
they're<00:00:55.949> blocked<00:00:56.190> by<00:00:56.370> enemies<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.750> thing

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
they're blocked by enemies and the thing

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
they're blocked by enemies and the thing
that<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.500> about<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.890> map<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.399> far

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that I really like about this map as far

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
that I really like about this map as far
as<00:00:59.760> spawns<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.480> domination<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.140> once<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
as spawns go for domination is once you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
as spawns go for domination is once you
get<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.190> enemy<00:01:02.609> team<00:01:02.820> spawning<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.510> say<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
get your enemy team spawning at say the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
get your enemy team spawning at say the
a<00:01:04.049> side<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> map<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.309> really<00:01:05.729> hard<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
a side of the map it's really hard to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.609 
a side of the map it's really hard to
flip<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> sea

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
flip them out all the way to the sea

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
flip them out all the way to the sea
flag<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.850> most<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.420> your

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
flag you really need like most of your

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
flag you really need like most of your
team<00:01:09.720> pushing<00:01:10.170> into<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.619> spawn<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
team pushing into that spawn with you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
team pushing into that spawn with you
and<00:01:11.520> blocking<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> different<00:01:12.600> spawn

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and blocking all the different spawn

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
and blocking all the different spawn
points<00:01:13.170> off<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
points off so because of this you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.690 
points off so because of this you can
actually<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.960> alone<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.460> go

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
actually go in alone and you can just go

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
actually go in alone and you can just go
back<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:17.970> forth<00:01:18.450> between<00:01:18.689> spawns<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
back and forth between spawns so you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
back and forth between spawns so you
might<00:01:20.009> kill<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> guy<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> left<00:01:20.790> side<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
might kill a guy the left side of the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
might kill a guy the left side of the
map<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:22.619> spawning<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> then

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
map and just as he spawning and then

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
map and just as he spawning and then
he's<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> spawn<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> right<00:01:24.390> side<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
he's going to spawn on the right side of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
he's going to spawn on the right side of
the<00:01:24.780> map<00:01:24.930> still<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> flag<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the map still at the a flag so you can

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
the map still at the a flag so you can
just<00:01:26.400> rotate<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> forth<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> keep

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
just rotate back and forth and keep

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
just rotate back and forth and keep
killing<00:01:28.770> people<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.369> come<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> spawn

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
killing people as they come out of spawn

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
killing people as they come out of spawn
so<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.750> why<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.140> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> memorize

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
so this is why you just want to memorize

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
so this is why you just want to memorize
the<00:01:31.890> exact<00:01:32.250> spawn<00:01:32.549> locations<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.350> where<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the exact spawn locations and where the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.590 
the exact spawn locations and where the
enemy<00:01:34.799> team<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> spawn

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
enemy team is going to spawn

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120 
enemy team is going to spawn
for<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.930> beef<00:01:38.080> leg<00:01:38.290> we<00:01:38.470> actually<00:01:38.860> only<00:01:39.040> have

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
for the beef leg we actually only have

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.679 
for the beef leg we actually only have
three<00:01:39.580> spawns<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:40.090> are<00:01:40.180> specifically

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
three spawns that are specifically

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.719 
three spawns that are specifically
attached<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> beef<00:01:41.500> leg<00:01:41.740> we<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.580> one

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
attached to the beef leg we have the one

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.160 
attached to the beef leg we have the one
in<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.939> top<00:01:43.150> right<00:01:43.390> corner<00:01:43.570> there<00:01:43.869> that<00:01:44.049> is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
in the top right corner there that is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.990 
in the top right corner there that is
actually<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.470> very<00:01:44.770> popular<00:01:45.100> spawn<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.759> looks

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
actually a very popular spawn it looks

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually a very popular spawn it looks
like<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.299> should<00:01:46.540> be<00:01:46.570> an<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.900> spawn<00:01:47.200> because<00:01:47.409> it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
like it should be an a spawn because it

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.020 
like it should be an a spawn because it
is<00:01:47.650> kind<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.950> towards<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> side<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> map

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
is kind of towards the a side of the map

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.749 
is kind of towards the a side of the map
but<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.659> is<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.110> fact<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.530> B<00:01:50.710> spawn<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.729> next

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
but that is in fact a B spawn the next

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.639 
but that is in fact a B spawn the next
one<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.240> have<00:01:52.390> is<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.840> bottom<00:01:53.170> floor<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
one we have is in the bottom floor of

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.560 
one we have is in the bottom floor of
the<00:01:53.860> two-story<00:01:54.310> building<00:01:54.970> towards<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> sea

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
the two-story building towards the sea

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.960 
the two-story building towards the sea
flag<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.740> also<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:57.009> B<00:01:57.220> spawn<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
flag that is also a B spawn and then the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.789 
flag that is also a B spawn and then the
final<00:01:58.149> one<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.630> actually<00:01:58.780> underground<00:01:59.440> in<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
final one is actually underground in the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.760 
final one is actually underground in the
water<00:02:00.039> there<00:02:00.899> finally<00:02:01.899> for<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.200> sea<00:02:02.350> flag<00:02:02.560> we

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
water there finally for the sea flag we

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.440 
water there finally for the sea flag we
once<00:02:02.979> again<00:02:03.070> have<00:02:03.220> seven<00:02:03.670> spawns<00:02:03.940> just<00:02:04.299> like

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
once again have seven spawns just like

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.270 
once again have seven spawns just like
the<00:02:04.570> eighth<00:02:04.690> leg<00:02:04.930> we<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.350> three<00:02:06.009> spawns

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
the eighth leg we have three spawns

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.279 
the eighth leg we have three spawns
along<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> back<00:02:06.880> side<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.330> map<00:02:07.509> then<00:02:08.170> we

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
along the back side of the map then we

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.809 
along the back side of the map then we
have<00:02:08.410> three<00:02:08.649> spawns<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.100> are<00:02:09.190> anchored<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.670> a

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
have three spawns that are anchored up a

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.120 
have three spawns that are anchored up a
little<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.209> more<00:02:10.360> towards<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.769> actual

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
little bit more towards the the actual

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.949 
little bit more towards the the actual
see<00:02:12.280> flag<00:02:12.519> itself<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.150> anchored<00:02:13.540> up<00:02:13.600> on<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
see flag itself and anchored up on the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.840 
see flag itself and anchored up on the
map<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> little<00:02:14.470> bit<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.769> then<00:02:15.310> finally<00:02:15.730> we

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
map a little bit and then finally we

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.309 
map a little bit and then finally we
have<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.269> really<00:02:16.510> weird<00:02:16.840> spawn<00:02:17.110> it's

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
have one really weird spawn it's

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.380 
have one really weird spawn it's
actually<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:18.010> mining<00:02:18.340> area<00:02:18.610> there<00:02:18.850> this

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
actually in the mining area there this

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.509 
actually in the mining area there this
is<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.569> very<00:02:19.750> rare<00:02:20.380> spawn<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.010> doesn't<00:02:21.400> really

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
is a very rare spawn it doesn't really

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.030 
is a very rare spawn it doesn't really
happen<00:02:21.730> too<00:02:22.030> often<00:02:22.410> maybe<00:02:23.410> if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.709> guys<00:02:23.830> are

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
happen too often maybe if you guys are

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.800 
happen too often maybe if you guys are
really<00:02:24.310> anchored<00:02:24.819> towards<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.360> mine<00:02:25.569> side

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
really anchored towards that mine side

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
really anchored towards that mine side
of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:25.989> map<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.319> you're<00:02:26.410> pushing<00:02:26.680> up<00:02:26.800> towards

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
of the map and you're pushing up towards

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.979 
of the map and you're pushing up towards
the<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.220> flag<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.760> hold<00:02:27.970> see<00:02:28.209> then<00:02:28.840> you

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
the a flag and you hold see then you

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.660 
the a flag and you hold see then you
will<00:02:29.080> spawn<00:02:29.350> here<00:02:29.590> but<00:02:29.769> other<00:02:29.980> than<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.250> this

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
will spawn here but other than that this

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.990 
will spawn here but other than that this
spawn<00:02:30.970> doesn't<00:02:31.569> typically<00:02:31.900> happen<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.850> those

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
spawn doesn't typically happen so those

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.280 
spawn doesn't typically happen so those
are<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.150> spawns<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.720> map<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.170> are

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
are the spawns for this map there are

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.720 
are the spawns for this map there are
quite<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> few<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.950> them<00:02:36.069> but<00:02:36.250> they<00:02:36.370> are<00:02:36.519> pretty

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
quite a few of them but they are pretty

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.309 
quite a few of them but they are pretty
straightforward<00:02:37.030> once<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.810> memorize<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
straightforward once you memorize the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.309 
straightforward once you memorize the
spawn<00:02:38.560> locations<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:40.720> last<00:02:40.900> thing<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.140> I

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
spawn locations one last thing that I

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.960 
spawn locations one last thing that I
can't<00:02:41.590> stress<00:02:41.890> enough<00:02:42.040> with<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.519> map<00:02:42.790> is

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
can't stress enough with this map is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.940 
can't stress enough with this map is
just<00:02:43.450> how<00:02:43.570> important<00:02:44.079> map<00:02:44.290> control<00:02:44.709> is

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
just how important map control is

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.880 
just how important map control is
especially<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:46.000> domination<00:02:46.420> if<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:47.709> hold

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
especially for domination if you hold

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.069 
especially for domination if you hold
say<00:02:48.190> C<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.760> B<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.450> have<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.660> enemy<00:02:49.780> team

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
say C and B and you have the enemy team

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.050 
say C and B and you have the enemy team
spawning<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> flag<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.880> can

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
spawning at the a flag you can

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.970 
spawning at the a flag you can
absolutely<00:02:52.269> wreck<00:02:52.989> them<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.380> their<00:02:53.560> spawn<00:02:53.829> at

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
absolutely wreck them in their spawn at

spawns<00:03:06.070> off<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.549> can<00:03:06.670> easily<00:03:06.940> contain

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
spawns off and you can easily contain

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.150

your enemies within the sea flag spawns

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.240 
your enemies within the sea flag spawns
and<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.730> can<00:03:09.850> rack<00:03:10.030> up<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.359> ton<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.720> kills

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
and you can rack up a ton of kills

and you can rack up a ton of kills

a red player spawn I'll give you guys a

a red player spawn I'll give you guys a
few<00:03:30.850> seconds<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.240> make<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.450> decision<00:03:36.420> if<00:03:37.420> you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
few seconds to make a decision if you

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.850 
few seconds to make a decision if you
chose<00:03:37.780> one<00:03:37.990> of<00:03:38.080> these<00:03:38.200> two<00:03:38.350> spawns<00:03:38.650> at<00:03:38.800> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
chose one of these two spawns at the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.230 
chose one of these two spawns at the
back<00:03:39.040> then<00:03:39.370> you're<00:03:39.520> most<00:03:39.730> likely<00:03:39.940> correct

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
back then you're most likely correct

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.290 
back then you're most likely correct
let's<00:03:41.080> go<00:03:41.230> over<00:03:41.500> why<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:43.120> first

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
let's go over why that is the first

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.820 
let's go over why that is the first
thing<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.600> want<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.810> look<00:03:43.870> at<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.650> green

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
thing we want to look at is the green

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.440 
thing we want to look at is the green
players<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.459> are<00:03:45.580> pushed<00:03:45.790> way<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.330> the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
players that are pushed way up on the

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.240 
players that are pushed way up on the
map<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.810> which<00:03:47.320> spawns<00:03:47.650> they<00:03:47.890> are<00:03:47.950> blocking

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
map and which spawns they are blocking

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.970 
map and which spawns they are blocking
as<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:49.209> can<00:03:49.300> see<00:03:49.480> only<00:03:49.690> two<00:03:50.020> spawns<00:03:50.350> are<00:03:50.590> very

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
as you can see only two spawns are very

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.490 
as you can see only two spawns are very
clearly<00:03:51.340> being<00:03:51.580> blocked<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.380> some<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.440> the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
clearly being blocked and some of the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500 
clearly being blocked and some of the
other<00:03:53.650> spawns<00:03:53.950> are<00:03:54.220> maybe<00:03:54.640> very<00:03:55.000> close<00:03:55.360> to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
other spawns are maybe very close to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.640 
other spawns are maybe very close to
being<00:03:55.540> blocked<00:03:55.930> there's<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:56.380> spawn

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
being blocked there's the one spawn

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.320 
being blocked there's the one spawn
that's<00:03:56.860> really<00:03:57.160> close<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.550> sea<00:03:57.790> flag<00:03:58.060> just

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
that's really close to the sea flag just

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.120 
that's really close to the sea flag just
inside<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.600> building<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.290> one<00:04:00.100> is

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
inside that building and that one is

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.190 
inside that building and that one is
extremely<00:04:00.880> close<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.270> being<00:04:01.450> blocked<00:04:01.720> but<00:04:01.989> I

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
extremely close to being blocked but I

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.810 
extremely close to being blocked but I
wouldn't<00:04:02.530> say<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.770> is<00:04:02.920> necessarily<00:04:03.489> blocked

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
wouldn't say it is necessarily blocked

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.100 
wouldn't say it is necessarily blocked
at<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.120> point<00:04:04.360> because<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.690> green<00:04:04.900> player

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
at this point because that green player

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.410 
at this point because that green player
hasn't<00:04:05.380> quite<00:04:05.709> come<00:04:05.950> around<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.310> corner<00:04:06.489> but

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
hasn't quite come around the corner but

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.120 
hasn't quite come around the corner but
he<00:04:07.690> could<00:04:07.930> be<00:04:07.959> influencing<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.739> spawn<00:04:09.100> a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
he could be influencing that spawn a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.100 
he could be influencing that spawn a
little<00:04:09.489> bit<00:04:09.640> now<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.420> next<00:04:10.600> thing<00:04:10.750> we<00:04:10.900> want<00:04:10.930> to

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
little bit now the next thing we want to

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.840 
little bit now the next thing we want to
look<00:04:11.170> at<00:04:11.380> is<00:04:11.560> where<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.190> red<00:04:12.340> players<00:04:12.640> are

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
look at is where the red players are

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.940 
look at is where the red players are
anchoring<00:04:13.239> their<00:04:13.450> spawn<00:04:13.720> towards<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.860> we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
anchoring their spawn towards and if we

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.349 
anchoring their spawn towards and if we
were<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.100> draw<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> circle<00:04:15.550> around<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.150> red

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
were to draw a circle around the red

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.000 
were to draw a circle around the red
team<00:04:16.600> right<00:04:16.810> now<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.590> would<00:04:17.709> see<00:04:17.890> that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
team right now you would see that

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.500 
team right now you would see that
they're<00:04:18.190> anchored<00:04:18.340> towards<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.880> top<00:04:19.120> side<00:04:19.359> of

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
they're anchored towards the top side of

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.670 
they're anchored towards the top side of
the<00:04:19.570> map<00:04:19.720> as<00:04:19.900> you're<00:04:20.080> looking<00:04:20.169> at<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.530> right

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
the map as you're looking at it right

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.860 
the map as you're looking at it right
now<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.100> they're<00:04:22.000> kind<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.270> anchored<00:04:22.600> towards

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
now and they're kind of anchored towards

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.570 
now and they're kind of anchored towards
the<00:04:22.990> back<00:04:23.169> side<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.620> map<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.430> why<00:04:24.550> I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
the back side of the map this is why I

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.000 
the back side of the map this is why I
chose<00:04:25.030> those<00:04:25.360> two<00:04:25.630> spawns<00:04:25.990> as<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.740> can<00:04:26.830> see

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
chose those two spawns as you can see

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.680 
chose those two spawns as you can see
there<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.669> one<00:04:27.850> spot<00:04:28.090> in<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.390> building

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
there is that one spot in the building

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.390 
there is that one spot in the building
that<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:29.110> mentioned<00:04:29.350> but<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.340> said

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
that I just mentioned but like I said

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.980 
that I just mentioned but like I said
that's<00:04:30.760> dangerously<00:04:31.360> close<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.690> being

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
that's dangerously close to being

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.630 
that's dangerously close to being
blocked<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.440> also<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.280> from<00:04:33.430> personal

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
blocked and also just from personal

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.580 
blocked and also just from personal
experience<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.450> isn't<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.110> very<00:04:35.350> popular

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
experience that isn't a very popular

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.500 
experience that isn't a very popular
spawn<00:04:36.100> but<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.640> two<00:04:36.790> spawns<00:04:37.090> at<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.360> very

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
spawn but the two spawns at the very

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.900 
spawn but the two spawns at the very
back<00:04:37.720> corner<00:04:38.169> those<00:04:38.500> are<00:04:38.740> very<00:04:39.130> popular<00:04:39.400> spots

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
back corner those are very popular spots

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.610 
back corner those are very popular spots
so<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.390> why<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.570> chose<00:04:40.840> those<00:04:41.080> bonds<00:04:41.410> as

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
so that is why I chose those bonds as

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.890 
so that is why I chose those bonds as
being<00:04:41.830> most<00:04:42.100> likely<00:04:42.630> moving<00:04:43.630> on<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
being most likely moving on to the

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.600 
being most likely moving on to the
second<00:04:44.290> test<00:04:44.440> I'm<00:04:44.620> not<00:04:44.890> going<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.190> change<00:04:45.370> any

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
second test I'm not going to change any

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.250 
second test I'm not going to change any
of<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.850> positioning<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.510> players<00:04:46.960> on<00:04:47.169> the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
of the positioning of the players on the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.540 
of the positioning of the players on the
map<00:04:47.440> I'm<00:04:47.650> just<00:04:47.890> going<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.130> say<00:04:48.250> that<00:04:48.430> this

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
map I'm just going to say that this

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.770 
map I'm just going to say that this
green<00:04:48.820> player<00:04:49.030> in<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.210> middle<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.630> map

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
green player in the middle of the map

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.170 
green player in the middle of the map
gets<00:04:50.110> killed<00:04:50.430> where<00:04:51.430> will<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:51.669> green<00:04:51.940> player

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
gets killed where will this green player

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.000 
gets killed where will this green player
spawn<00:04:52.510> once<00:04:53.200> again<00:04:53.470> I'll<00:04:53.620> give<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.860> guys<00:04:53.979> a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
spawn once again I'll give you guys a

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:01.290 
spawn once again I'll give you guys a
few<00:04:54.250> seconds<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.669> make<00:04:54.760> your<00:04:54.820> choice<00:04:59.460> if<00:05:00.460> you

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
few seconds to make your choice if you

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.880 
few seconds to make your choice if you
picked<00:05:01.479> one<00:05:01.690> of<00:05:01.780> these<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:02.290> spawns<00:05:02.590> you're

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
picked one of these to be spawns you're

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.100 
picked one of these to be spawns you're
almost<00:05:03.040> definitely<00:05:03.729> correct<00:05:04.030> let's<00:05:04.750> go<00:05:04.900> over

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
almost definitely correct let's go over

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.010 
almost definitely correct let's go over
why<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.500> is

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
why that is

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.450 
why that is
alright<00:05:07.289> so<00:05:07.440> since<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.860> red<00:05:08.009> players<00:05:08.280> are

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
alright so since the red players are

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.920 
alright so since the red players are
really<00:05:08.669> pushed<00:05:08.970> back<00:05:09.150> into<00:05:09.389> their<00:05:09.479> spawn<00:05:09.720> we

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
really pushed back into their spawn we

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.420 
really pushed back into their spawn we
don't<00:05:10.199> really<00:05:10.319> have<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.620> worry<00:05:10.650> about<00:05:11.009> a<00:05:11.160> green

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
don't really have to worry about a green

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.279 
don't really have to worry about a green
spawn<00:05:11.729> being<00:05:12.030> blocked<00:05:12.330> off<00:05:12.539> at<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.870> moment<00:05:13.199> so

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
spawn being blocked off at the moment so

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.629 
spawn being blocked off at the moment so
we<00:05:13.410> only<00:05:13.620> really<00:05:13.889> have<00:05:14.009> to<00:05:14.250> worry<00:05:14.460> about

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
we only really have to worry about

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.909 
we only really have to worry about
anchoring<00:05:15.270> one<00:05:16.259> big<00:05:16.500> thing<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:16.889> should

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
anchoring one big thing that you should

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.070 
anchoring one big thing that you should
notice<00:05:17.280> here<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.639> that<00:05:17.789> this<00:05:18.090> entire<00:05:18.270> area<00:05:18.780> by

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
notice here is that this entire area by

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.050 
notice here is that this entire area by
the<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.229> flag<00:05:19.650> doesn't<00:05:20.190> contain<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.639> single

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the a flag doesn't contain a single

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.790 
the a flag doesn't contain a single
green<00:05:21.479> player<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:22.169> means<00:05:22.349> there<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.560> nobody

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
green player that means there is nobody

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.559 
green player that means there is nobody
answering<00:05:23.159> to<00:05:23.610> one<00:05:23.789> of<00:05:23.909> those<00:05:23.970> spawns<00:05:24.330> back

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
answering to one of those spawns back

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.210 
answering to one of those spawns back
there<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:24.960> it's<00:05:25.379> definitely<00:05:25.800> going<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.129> be

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
there and it's definitely going to be

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.010 
there and it's definitely going to be
one<00:05:26.639> of<00:05:26.669> these<00:05:26.879> two<00:05:27.120> spots<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.720> are<00:05:27.870> be

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
one of these two spots that are be

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.800 
one of these two spots that are be
spawned<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:29.430> situation<00:05:30.030> also<00:05:30.240> proves<00:05:30.690> just

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
spawned this situation also proves just

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.050 
spawned this situation also proves just
how<00:05:31.110> important<00:05:31.620> map<00:05:31.800> control<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.370> on<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:32.819> map

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
how important map control is on this map

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.029 
how important map control is on this map
because<00:05:33.690> if<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.900> green<00:05:34.110> player<00:05:34.289> were<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.590> die<00:05:34.740> he

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
because if a green player were to die he

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.409 
because if a green player were to die he
would<00:05:35.159> just<00:05:35.340> spawn<00:05:35.550> mid<00:05:35.789> map<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.240> he'd<00:05:36.270> be

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
would just spawn mid map and he'd be

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.939 
would just spawn mid map and he'd be
able<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.750> fill<00:05:36.960> his<00:05:37.139> position<00:05:37.289> almost

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
able to fill his position almost

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.159 
able to fill his position almost
instantly<00:05:38.490> whereas<00:05:39.270> if<00:05:39.419> there<00:05:39.569> was<00:05:39.659> one<00:05:39.840> green

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
instantly whereas if there was one green

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.719 
instantly whereas if there was one green
player<00:05:40.380> way<00:05:40.680> at<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:40.919> back<00:05:41.039> of<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.340> flag

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
player way at the back of the a flag

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.580 
player way at the back of the a flag
then<00:05:42.240> he<00:05:42.449> might<00:05:42.659> be<00:05:42.810> anchoring<00:05:43.139> that<00:05:43.319> spawn

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
then he might be anchoring that spawn

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.290 
then he might be anchoring that spawn
all<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.009> way<00:05:44.099> back<00:05:44.310> there<00:05:44.639> and<00:05:44.819> then<00:05:45.030> all<00:05:45.270> of

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
all the way back there and then all of

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.330 
all the way back there and then all of
his<00:05:45.509> teammates<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:46.050> die<00:05:46.259> will<00:05:46.710> spawn<00:05:46.979> way<00:05:47.190> at

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
his teammates that die will spawn way at

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.800 
his teammates that die will spawn way at
the<00:05:47.430> back<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.759> a<00:05:47.819> flag<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.389> it<00:05:48.479> might<00:05:48.630> take

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
the back of the a flag and it might take

I'll<00:06:06.569> give<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.750> guys<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.930> few<00:06:07.139> seconds<00:06:07.409> to<00:06:07.500> make

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
I'll give you guys a few seconds to make

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.510 
I'll give you guys a few seconds to make
a<00:06:07.680> decision<00:06:12.560> if<00:06:13.560> you<00:06:13.770> pick<00:06:13.889> this<00:06:14.099> spot<00:06:14.159> right

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
a decision if you pick this spot right

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.370 
a decision if you pick this spot right
here<00:06:14.639> then<00:06:15.090> you're<00:06:15.210> most<00:06:15.449> likely<00:06:15.690> correct<00:06:15.960> but

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
here then you're most likely correct but

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.839 
here then you're most likely correct but
there<00:06:16.590> is<00:06:16.710> another<00:06:16.740> spawn<00:06:17.280> that<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.460> wouldn't

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
there is another spawn that I wouldn't

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.999 
there is another spawn that I wouldn't
completely<00:06:18.150> rule<00:06:18.539> out<00:06:18.569> let's<00:06:19.469> go<00:06:19.620> over<00:06:19.860> why

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009 
completely rule out let's go over why

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.430 
completely rule out let's go over why
that<00:06:20.219> is<00:06:20.400> so<00:06:21.389> first<00:06:21.630> off<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:22.020> green<00:06:22.199> players

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
that is so first off the green players

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.990 
that is so first off the green players
are<00:06:22.650> grouped<00:06:22.979> up<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.310> this<00:06:23.430> really<00:06:23.789> tight

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
are grouped up in this really tight

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.490 
are grouped up in this really tight
group<00:06:24.270> right<00:06:24.509> here<00:06:24.539> so<00:06:24.990> if<00:06:25.050> we<00:06:25.169> were<00:06:25.229> to<00:06:25.289> draw<00:06:25.469> a

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
group right here so if we were to draw a

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.719 
group right here so if we were to draw a
circle<00:06:25.680> around<00:06:25.919> them<00:06:26.190> this<00:06:26.370> is<00:06:26.490> what<00:06:26.639> you

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
circle around them this is what you

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.879 
circle around them this is what you
would<00:06:26.849> see<00:06:27.060> so<00:06:27.990> since<00:06:28.229> they're<00:06:28.380> all<00:06:28.469> pushed<00:06:28.710> up

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
would see so since they're all pushed up

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.320 
would see so since they're all pushed up
kind<00:06:29.159> of<00:06:29.279> a<00:06:29.430> little<00:06:29.669> bit<00:06:29.789> more<00:06:29.909> towards<00:06:30.210> the

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
kind of a little bit more towards the

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.029 
kind of a little bit more towards the
beef<00:06:30.509> leg<00:06:30.779> they<00:06:31.259> are<00:06:31.409> not<00:06:31.620> going<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:31.949> be

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
beef leg they are not going to be

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.589 
beef leg they are not going to be
anchoring<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.460> spawns<00:06:32.699> to<00:06:32.909> these<00:06:33.060> back<00:06:33.330> to

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
anchoring the spawns to these back to

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.120 
anchoring the spawns to these back to
spawns<00:06:33.930> right<00:06:34.169> here<00:06:34.500> so<00:06:34.680> those<00:06:34.860> are<00:06:34.979> going<00:06:35.069> to

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
spawns right here so those are going to

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.459 
spawns right here so those are going to
be<00:06:35.219> ruled<00:06:35.490> out<00:06:35.639> completely<00:06:36.469> similarly

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
be ruled out completely similarly

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:38.839 
be ruled out completely similarly
they're<00:06:37.680> not<00:06:37.860> going<00:06:38.009> to<00:06:38.130> be<00:06:38.250> spawning<00:06:38.490> at<00:06:38.699> the

they're not going to be spawning at the

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.430 
they're not going to be spawning at the

bottom side of the map at the a spawn
speak<00:06:40.710> I'd<00:06:41.219> players<00:06:41.490> are<00:06:41.669> over<00:06:41.849> there<00:06:41.940> first

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.180 
speak I'd players are over there first
off<00:06:42.479> and<00:06:42.659> second<00:06:43.529> there<00:06:43.710> are<00:06:43.800> no<00:06:43.949> green

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.050 
players over there anchoring the spawn
in<00:06:45.779> that<00:06:45.990> direction<00:06:46.400> so<00:06:47.400> this<00:06:47.550> leaves<00:06:47.729> us<00:06:47.849> with

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
in that direction so this leaves us with

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.610 
in that direction so this leaves us with
two<00:06:48.300> remaining<00:06:48.690> a<00:06:48.900> spawns<00:06:49.229> that<00:06:49.380> they<00:06:49.469> could

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
two remaining a spawns that they could

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.800 
two remaining a spawns that they could
spawn<00:06:49.860> at<00:06:50.069> and<00:06:50.250> the<00:06:50.849> reason<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.180> chose<00:06:51.360> that<00:06:51.569> one

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
spawn at and the reason I chose that one

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.839 
spawn at and the reason I chose that one
spawn<00:06:52.080> over<00:06:52.409> the<00:06:52.500> other<00:06:52.650> one<00:06:52.830> basically<00:06:53.370> just

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
spawn over the other one basically just

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.670 
spawn over the other one basically just
comes<00:06:54.029> from<00:06:54.180> personal<00:06:54.509> experience<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:55.469> spawn

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
comes from personal experience the spawn

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.499 
comes from personal experience the spawn
that<00:06:55.860> I<00:06:55.919> chose<00:06:56.159> is<00:06:56.370> one<00:06:56.610> of<00:06:56.699> the<00:06:56.789> most<00:06:56.909> popular

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
that I chose is one of the most popular

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:59.719 
that I chose is one of the most popular
a<00:06:57.659> spawns<00:06:57.990> on<00:06:58.169> this<00:06:58.469> map<00:06:58.680> and<00:06:58.979> that<00:06:59.370> just<00:06:59.550> comes

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
a spawns on this map and that just comes

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.580 
a spawns on this map and that just comes
from<00:06:59.880> personal<00:07:00.150> experience<00:07:00.599> like<00:07:00.750> I<00:07:00.870> said<00:07:01.139> the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
from personal experience like I said the

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.860 
from personal experience like I said the
other<00:07:01.800> one<00:07:02.039> that<00:07:02.219> I<00:07:02.250> circle<00:07:02.639> right<00:07:02.819> here<00:07:02.880> this

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
other one that I circle right here this

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.140 
other one that I circle right here this
is<00:07:03.930> underground<00:07:04.469> and<00:07:04.830> it's<00:07:05.219> really<00:07:05.699> a<00:07:05.729> rare

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
is underground and it's really a rare

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.820 
is underground and it's really a rare
spawn<00:07:06.539> I<00:07:06.779> don't<00:07:06.990> really<00:07:07.110> see<00:07:07.229> it<00:07:07.469> too<00:07:07.620> often

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
spawn I don't really see it too often

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.800 
spawn I don't really see it too often
and<00:07:08.130> usually<00:07:08.580> it<00:07:08.849> only<00:07:08.909> happens<00:07:09.389> if<00:07:09.509> the<00:07:09.630> green

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
and usually it only happens if the green

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.990 
and usually it only happens if the green
team<00:07:10.050> is<00:07:10.229> pushed<00:07:10.529> up<00:07:10.650> underground<00:07:11.039> and<00:07:11.520> they

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 
team is pushed up underground and they

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.820 
team is pushed up underground and they
have<00:07:12.150> a<00:07:12.180> little<00:07:12.419> bit<00:07:12.569> of<00:07:12.599> map<00:07:12.840> control<00:07:13.229> so<00:07:13.800> that

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
have a little bit of map control so that

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.490 
have a little bit of map control so that
is<00:07:14.099> why<00:07:14.219> i<00:07:14.250> said<00:07:14.639> that<00:07:14.669> spawn<00:07:15.060> right<00:07:15.300> there<00:07:15.570> so

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
is why i said that spawn right there so

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.719 
is why i said that spawn right there so
that's<00:07:16.589> going<00:07:16.770> to<00:07:16.860> wrap<00:07:16.949> it<00:07:17.009> up<00:07:17.190> for<00:07:17.370> this<00:07:17.430> last
