may seem like a difficult task but if
you<00:00:03.929> break<00:00:04.170> it<00:00:04.319> down<00:00:04.500> into<00:00:04.859> simple<00:00:05.190> steps<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
you break it down into simple steps and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.390 
you break it down into simple steps and
simple<00:00:06.600> parts<00:00:06.960> it's<00:00:07.410> not<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.830> bad<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.250> make<00:00:08.370> a

little bit first of all you notice that
there<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.359> 4<00:00:27.689> anchor<00:00:28.019> points<00:00:28.590> if<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.250> click<00:00:29.519> on

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
there are 4 anchor points if I click on

the direct selection tool I can notice
that<00:00:32.550> these<00:00:32.730> anchor<00:00:33.149> points<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that these anchor points have the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
that these anchor points have the
handles<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.130> over<00:00:35.460> half<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the next anchor point these anchor point

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.900 
the next anchor point these anchor point
or<00:00:41.879> these<00:00:42.030> handles<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.629> creating<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> angle

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
or these handles are creating the angle

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
or these handles are creating the angle
that<00:00:45.030> comes<00:00:45.270> off<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> anchor<00:00:46.079> point<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that comes off of the anchor point so to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
that comes off of the anchor point so to
recreate<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.690> could<00:00:49.050> grab<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> pen<00:00:49.620> tool

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
recreate this I could grab the pen tool

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.959 
recreate this I could grab the pen tool
and<00:00:50.100> try<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> mimic<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.379> areas<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> drag

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and try to mimic the same areas and drag

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.299 
and try to mimic the same areas and drag
the<00:00:54.149> handles<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> same<00:00:54.899> distance<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the handles the same distance that this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.240 
the handles the same distance that this
does<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.180> instead<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> help

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.090 
kind of goes up and down a little bit
the<00:01:54.390> handles<00:01:54.720> too<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.320> hold<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.710> shift<00:01:55.740> key

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the handles too if I hold the shift key

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.690 
the handles too if I hold the shift key
this<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.299> constrain<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.700> 45

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this is going to constrain it to 45

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.950 
this is going to constrain it to 45
degree<00:02:00.060> angle<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.869> ahead

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
degree angle so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.310 
degree angle so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:01.259> move<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> over<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.369> two<00:02:02.729> three<00:02:03.420> four<00:02:04.110> and

hold shift to the first handle that I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.860 
hold shift to the first handle that I
created<00:02:46.140> now<00:02:46.800> by<00:02:47.040> doing<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.400> I've<00:02:47.850> created<00:02:48.600> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
created now by doing this I've created a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.650 
created now by doing this I've created a
circle<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.770> pretty<00:02:50.070> close<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:51.150> perfect

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
circle that is pretty close to a perfect

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.110 
circle that is pretty close to a perfect
circle<00:02:52.050> with<00:02:52.740> practice<00:02:53.310> you'll<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.850> able<00:02:53.910> to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
circle with practice you'll be able to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.630 
circle with practice you'll be able to
do<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.510> without<00:02:54.930> using<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.620> grid<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.460> when

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
do this without using the grid but when

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.550 
do this without using the grid but when
you<00:02:56.730> first<00:02:56.910> start<00:02:57.180> off<00:02:57.270> using<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.110> pen<00:02:58.320> tool

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
you first start off using the pen tool

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.890 
you first start off using the pen tool
to<00:02:58.680> create<00:02:58.800> circles<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.670> recommend<00:03:00.480> using<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
to create circles I recommend using the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.660 
to create circles I recommend using the
grid<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.160> your<00:03:02.280> circles

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
grid so that you can get your circles

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.030 
grid so that you can get your circles
more<00:03:02.880> accurate<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.510> precise<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.200> turn<00:03:04.860> off

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
more accurate and precise to turn off

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.440 
more accurate and precise to turn off
the<00:03:05.220> grid<00:03:05.460> simply<00:03:06.150> go<00:03:06.300> back<00:03:06.330> up<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.930> view<00:03:08.450> hide

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the grid simply go back up to view hide

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.410 
the grid simply go back up to view hide
grids<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.430> now<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.490> can<00:03:11.700> see<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.030> circle

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
grids and now you can see the circle

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.370 
grids and now you can see the circle
that<00:03:12.570> was<00:03:12.900> created<00:03:13.350> using<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.950> pen<00:03:14.160> tool
