people can actually see the area here

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.830 
people can actually see the area here
that<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.720> surgeons<00:02:30.170> carved<00:02:31.040> up<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.940> I'm

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
that the surgeons carved up and I'm

that the surgeons carved up and I'm
going<00:02:33.109> to<00:02:33.260> turn<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.129> gently<00:02:34.579> this<00:02:34.760> way

going to turn you gently this way

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.770 
going to turn you gently this way
and<00:02:35.359> actually<00:02:36.019> show<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:38.420> has<00:02:38.629> to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
and actually show you that it has to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.410 
and actually show you that it has to
come<00:02:38.959> from<00:02:39.049> somewhere<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.150> what<00:02:41.299> they

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
come from somewhere so this is what they

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.000 
come from somewhere so this is what they
do<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> lot<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.910> real<00:02:44.209> estate<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.959> cover

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
do this is a lot of real estate to cover

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.879 
do this is a lot of real estate to cover
with<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.310> bit<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.579> hair<00:02:46.760> from<00:02:46.790> here<00:02:47.299> and

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
with a little bit of hair from here and

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.940 
with a little bit of hair from here and
when<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:49.670> surgeons<00:02:50.180> implant<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.260> hair<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
when the surgeons implant to hair it

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.800 
when the surgeons implant to hair it
kills<00:02:52.280> hair<00:02:52.549> follicles<00:02:53.060> around<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.690> then

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
kills hair follicles around it and then

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.400 
kills hair follicles around it and then
20<00:02:54.139> percent<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.560> these<00:02:54.709> that<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.069> implant<00:02:55.430> die

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
20 percent of these that the implant die

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.099 
20 percent of these that the implant die
so<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.769> gets<00:02:57.950> thinner<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.609> thinner<00:02:58.669> and<00:02:59.329> more

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
so it gets thinner and thinner and more

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.420 
so it gets thinner and thinner and more
thin<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:02.410> most<00:03:03.410> surgeons<00:03:03.919> will<00:03:04.069> tell<00:03:04.280> you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
thin and most surgeons will tell you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.059 
thin and most surgeons will tell you
that<00:03:04.639> they<00:03:04.790> really<00:03:05.290> can't<00:03:06.290> keep<00:03:06.560> up<00:03:06.829> with<00:03:07.040> a

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
that they really can't keep up with a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.720 
that they really can't keep up with a
hair<00:03:07.340> fall<00:03:07.790> out<00:03:07.819> or<00:03:08.299> loss<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:10.160> what<00:03:10.609> we're

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
but first off let's look at what we did

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.529 
but first off let's look at what we did
and<00:05:13.099> remember<00:05:13.550> it's<00:05:13.669> a<00:05:13.729> light<00:05:13.879> density<00:05:14.090> and

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
and remember it's a light density and

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.839 
and remember it's a light density and
later<00:05:14.900> on<00:05:15.199> we're<00:05:15.440> actually<00:05:15.650> going<00:05:16.129> to<00:05:16.250> be

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
later on we're actually going to be

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.850 
later on we're actually going to be
adding<00:05:17.210> more<00:05:17.240> density<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:17.990> so<00:05:18.590> this<00:05:18.710> is

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
adding more density to it so this is

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.999 
adding more density to it so this is

and it goes all the way around so he's

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.089 
and it goes all the way around so he's

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.550 
remember we're all true custom and we
have<00:06:24.830> to<00:06:25.039> like<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.370> said<00:06:25.610> in<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:26.110> in<00:06:27.110> another

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
have to like I said in the in another

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.839 
have to like I said in the in another
segment<00:06:27.830> I'm<00:06:28.099> not<00:06:28.219> sure<00:06:28.370> if<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.520> was<00:06:28.580> today<00:06:28.819> or

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
segment I'm not sure if it was today or

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.920 
segment I'm not sure if it was today or
not<00:06:29.089> of<00:06:29.449> how<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:32.060> know<00:06:32.180> we<00:06:32.449> work<00:06:32.690> with<00:06:32.839> the

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
not of how you know we work with the

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.959 
not of how you know we work with the
individual<00:06:33.349> on<00:06:33.500> their<00:06:33.710> particular<00:06:34.370> needs

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
individual on their particular needs

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.230 
individual on their particular needs
so<00:06:35.270> John's<00:06:35.960> need<00:06:36.289> is<00:06:36.650> to<00:06:36.979> leave<00:06:37.219> here<00:06:37.250> with

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
so John's need is to leave here with

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.629 
so John's need is to leave here with
very<00:06:38.539> little<00:06:38.839> hair<00:06:39.020> but<00:06:39.409> more<00:06:39.620> here<00:06:39.830> so<00:06:40.039> he

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
very little hair but more here so he

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.260 
very little hair but more here so he
doesn't<00:06:40.669> shock<00:06:41.060> everyone

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
doesn't shock everyone

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.090 
doesn't shock everyone
then<00:06:42.450> since<00:06:42.780> we're<00:06:42.900> ultra<00:06:43.200> custom<00:06:43.530> can<00:06:43.800> tweak

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
then since we're ultra custom can tweak

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.700 
then since we're ultra custom can tweak
and<00:06:44.310> modify<00:06:44.520> and<00:06:45.270> adjust<00:06:45.660> things<00:06:46.140> according

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
and modify and adjust things according

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.880 
and modify and adjust things according
to<00:06:46.860> his<00:06:47.040> needs<00:06:47.580> we're<00:06:48.420> going<00:06:48.630> to<00:06:48.750> be<00:06:48.890> putting

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
to his needs we're going to be putting

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.790 
to his needs we're going to be putting
more<00:06:50.340> density<00:06:50.850> because<00:06:51.330> he<00:06:51.990> actually<00:06:52.380> needs

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
more density because he actually needs

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.290 
more density because he actually needs
more<00:06:53.040> length<00:06:53.280> remember<00:06:53.640> I<00:06:53.760> started<00:06:54.090> off<00:06:54.180> with

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
more length remember I started off with

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.730 
more length remember I started off with
very<00:06:54.450> little<00:06:54.720> density<00:06:55.170> we<00:06:55.320> started<00:06:55.680> this

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
very little density we started this

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.320 
very little density we started this
about<00:06:55.890> width<00:06:56.190> so<00:06:56.760> he<00:06:56.880> doesn't<00:06:57.150> have<00:06:57.240> the

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
about width so he doesn't have the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.720 
about width so he doesn't have the
fullness<00:06:57.720> down<00:06:57.960> here<00:06:58.320> that<00:06:58.950> we<00:06:59.130> would<00:06:59.340> like<00:06:59.520> at

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
fullness down here that we would like at

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.420 
fullness down here that we would like at
this<00:06:59.940> moment<00:07:00.080> but<00:07:01.080> he's<00:07:01.200> got<00:07:01.350> two<00:07:01.560> systems<00:07:02.010> so

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
this moment but he's got two systems so

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.590 
this moment but he's got two systems so
on<00:07:02.550> one<00:07:02.730> of<00:07:02.760> those<00:07:02.940> we're<00:07:03.240> gonna<00:07:03.330> be<00:07:03.480> adding

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
on one of those we're gonna be adding

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.320 
on one of those we're gonna be adding
density<00:07:04.170> for<00:07:04.380> his<00:07:04.500> length<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.670> then<00:07:05.880> we're

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
density for his length and then we're

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.310 
density for his length and then we're
gonna<00:07:06.450> add<00:07:06.720> this<00:07:07.020> that<00:07:07.500> same<00:07:07.830> density<00:07:09.290> so<00:07:10.290> that

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
gonna add this that same density so that

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.720 
gonna add this that same density so that
he<00:07:10.530> can<00:07:10.650> have<00:07:10.800> linked<00:07:11.070> on<00:07:11.160> this<00:07:11.280> one<00:07:11.520> we're

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
he can have linked on this one we're

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.980 
he can have linked on this one we're
gonna<00:07:11.820> replace<00:07:12.120> all<00:07:12.360> the<00:07:12.450> hair<00:07:12.630> in<00:07:12.720> the<00:07:12.810> back

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
gonna replace all the hair in the back

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.480 
gonna replace all the hair in the back
and<00:07:13.230> put<00:07:13.350> more<00:07:13.530> density<00:07:13.770> in<00:07:13.950> the<00:07:14.010> front<00:07:14.280> and

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
and put more density in the front and

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.960 
and put more density in the front and
then<00:07:15.210> he<00:07:15.450> gradually<00:07:16.230> went<00:07:16.620> to<00:07:16.830> the<00:07:16.980> point<00:07:17.250> that

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
then he gradually went to the point that

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.320 
then he gradually went to the point that
he<00:07:18.540> he<00:07:19.440> you<00:07:20.100> know<00:07:20.220> we<00:07:20.430> got<00:07:20.610> will<00:07:20.880> hit<00:07:21.150> that

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
he he you know we got will hit that

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.080 
he he you know we got will hit that
point<00:07:21.540> that<00:07:21.750> he<00:07:21.810> really<00:07:22.530> wanted<00:07:22.860> but<00:07:23.760> anyway

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
point that he really wanted but anyway

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.500 
point that he really wanted but anyway
even<00:07:24.690> the<00:07:25.020> way<00:07:25.140> it<00:07:25.170> is<00:07:25.410> right<00:07:25.650> now<00:07:25.850> it's<00:07:26.850> very

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
even the way it is right now it's very

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.150 
even the way it is right now it's very
successful<00:07:28.550> and<00:07:29.550> it's<00:07:30.330> not<00:07:30.630> about<00:07:30.950> every<00:07:31.950> hair

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
successful and it's not about every hair

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.010 
successful and it's not about every hair
in<00:07:32.280> place<00:07:32.310> let's<00:07:32.910> just<00:07:33.120> have<00:07:33.300> some<00:07:33.510> fun<00:07:33.720> here
