00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
excesses also I notice now that I'm

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.880 
excesses also I notice now that I'm
traveling<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.439> lot<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:16.799> air<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.790> air<00:01:18.240> travel

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
traveling a lot by air that air travel

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
traveling a lot by air that air travel
also<00:01:19.890> contributes<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> belly<00:01:20.759> blowing<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.450> as

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
also contributes to belly blowing so as

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.870 
also contributes to belly blowing so as
you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.590> travel<00:01:23.159> by<00:01:23.280> air<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you know when we travel by air that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
you know when we travel by air that
cabin<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.900> plane<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.470> pressurized<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
cabin in that plane is pressurized to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640 
cabin in that plane is pressurized to
five<00:01:26.700> thousand<00:01:27.150> eight<00:01:27.210> thousand<00:01:27.780> feet<00:01:28.470> above

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
five thousand eight thousand feet above

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.280 
five thousand eight thousand feet above
sea<00:01:29.100> level<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.299> change<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.020> air

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
sea level and with that change in air

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.569 
sea level and with that change in air
pressure<00:01:31.350> our<00:01:32.900> air<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.290> our<00:01:34.470> bodies<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.460> our

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pressure our air in our bodies so in our

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.170 
pressure our air in our bodies so in our
bowel<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.630> adjust<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.610> expand

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
bowel will adjust and so it can expand

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.110 
bowel will adjust and so it can expand
by<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
by as much as

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.540 
by as much as
twenty-five<00:01:40.720> percent<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:42.070> you'll<00:01:42.220> notice

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
twenty-five percent so you'll notice

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.040 
twenty-five percent so you'll notice
that<00:01:42.730> sometimes<00:01:43.120> you'll<00:01:43.540> get<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.810> quite

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
that sometimes you'll get it quite

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.730 
that sometimes you'll get it quite
loaded<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.830> that's<00:01:45.010> because<00:01:45.370> of<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.640> err

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
loaded and that's because of that err

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.190 
loaded and that's because of that err
aggravated<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.280> situation<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.540> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
aggravated that situation is the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.650 
aggravated that situation is the
dehydration<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.490> plane<00:01:51.730> circulates<00:01:52.390> air

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
dehydration so the plane circulates air

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.110 
dehydration so the plane circulates air
and<00:01:52.930> we<00:01:53.020> get<00:01:53.140> dehydrated<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.280> also

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
and we get dehydrated and that also

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.840 
and we get dehydrated and that also
contributes<00:01:55.780> because<00:01:56.740> as<00:01:56.890> we<00:01:57.040> get<00:01:57.160> dehydrated

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
contributes because as we get dehydrated

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.790 
contributes because as we get dehydrated
or<00:01:57.970> body<00:01:58.180> wants<00:01:58.480> to<00:01:58.570> hold<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.200> water<00:01:59.440> and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
or body wants to hold on to water and

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.940 
or body wants to hold on to water and
retain<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.300> cure<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.990> walk<00:02:02.710> around

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
retain it so to cure that walk around

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.860 
retain it so to cure that walk around
the<00:02:03.220> airport<00:02:03.640> walk<00:02:03.910> around<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.390> cabin<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
the airport walk around the cabin and

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.590 
the airport walk around the cabin and
drink<00:02:05.110> plenty<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.530> water<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:06.490> dehydration<00:02:07.270> is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
drink plenty of water so dehydration is

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.650 
drink plenty of water so dehydration is
our<00:02:07.780> second<00:02:08.590> cause<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:10.000> we<00:02:10.149> bloating

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
our second cause of that we bloating

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.380 
our second cause of that we bloating
that's<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.020> try<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.500> retain<00:02:11.800> water<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.910> things

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
that's we try and retain water so things

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.570 
that's we try and retain water so things
like<00:02:13.570> excess<00:02:14.050> sodium<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.740> salt<00:02:15.010> also

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
like excess sodium and salt also

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.280 
like excess sodium and salt also
contribute<00:02:16.180> because<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.780> body<00:02:16.990> always

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
contribute because your body always

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.720 
contribute because your body always
wants<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.830> maintain<00:02:17.980> what's<00:02:18.460> called

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
wants to maintain what's called

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.000 
wants to maintain what's called
homeostasis<00:02:19.390> or<00:02:19.720> balance<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> more

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
homeostasis or balance so the more

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.040 
homeostasis or balance so the more
sodium<00:02:21.460> we<00:02:21.760> take<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.180> our<00:02:22.330> bodies<00:02:22.630> try<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
sodium we take in our bodies try and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.320 
sodium we take in our bodies try and
dilute<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.340> by<00:02:24.550> holding<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
dilute that and by holding on to the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.030 
dilute that and by holding on to the
water<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.840> that's<00:02:26.020> not<00:02:26.260> really<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:26.800> want

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
water so that's not really what we want

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.580 
water so that's not really what we want
so<00:02:27.250> minimize<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.660> drink<00:02:28.870> plenty<00:02:29.260> of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
so minimize that and drink plenty of

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.530 
so minimize that and drink plenty of
fresh<00:02:30.040> water<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.510> next<00:02:31.960> cause<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.620> stress

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
fresh water the next cause is stress

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.300 
fresh water the next cause is stress
stress<00:02:34.540> increases<00:02:35.320> our<00:02:35.440> cortisol<00:02:35.980> hormone

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
stress increases our cortisol hormone

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.990 
stress increases our cortisol hormone
which<00:02:37.030> increases<00:02:37.780> our<00:02:38.080> belly<00:02:38.680> fat<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.790> that's

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
which increases our belly fat so that's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.570 
which increases our belly fat so that's
a<00:02:40.270> real<00:02:40.720> cause<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.710> lot<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.070> people<00:02:42.400> don't

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
a real cause that a lot of people don't

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.540 
a real cause that a lot of people don't
really<00:02:42.850> take<00:02:43.150> notice<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:44.980> always<00:02:45.190> want

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
really take notice of so we always want

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.250 
really take notice of so we always want
to<00:02:45.610> look<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:45.970> ways<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.150> minimize<00:02:46.720> stress<00:02:47.050> I'm

stress<00:03:55.120> management<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.840> another<00:03:56.170> one<00:03:56.410> now

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
stress management is another one now

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.580 
stress management is another one now
like<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.370> protein<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.000> think<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.450> those<00:03:58.600> children

these huge bellies kwashiorkor that's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.160 
these huge bellies kwashiorkor that's

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
have a good source of lean protein and I

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.110 
have a good source of lean protein and I
must<00:04:32.230> say<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.410> believe<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.250> have<00:04:33.460> one<00:04:34.030> of

must say I believe that I have one of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.150 
must say I believe that I have one of

the best sources of organic under

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.970 
the best sources of organic under
natured<00:04:36.520> whey<00:04:36.700> protein<00:04:37.350> daily<00:04:38.350> that's<00:04:38.560> highly

natured whey protein daily that's highly
absorbable<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:39.850> helps<00:04:40.210> contribute<00:04:40.780> to

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
absorbable and that helps contribute to

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.130 
absorbable and that helps contribute to
a<00:04:41.110> loose<00:04:41.440> physique<00:04:42.480> excess<00:04:43.480> carbs<00:04:43.900> that's

a loose physique excess carbs that's

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.450 
a loose physique excess carbs that's
another<00:04:44.440> cause<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:45.930> belly<00:04:46.930> fat<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.650> what

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
another cause of belly fat and what

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.190 
another cause of belly fat and what
happens<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:48.970> when<00:04:49.120> we<00:04:49.150> have<00:04:49.420> excess

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
happens is when we have excess

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.620 
happens is when we have excess
carbohydrates<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:51.520> gets<00:04:51.760> stored<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.360> our

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
carbohydrates it gets stored in our

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.750 
carbohydrates it gets stored in our
muscles<00:04:53.050> as<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.320> my<00:04:53.440> kitchen<00:04:53.830> that's<00:04:54.100> one<00:04:54.340> one

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
muscles as the my kitchen that's one one

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.240 
muscles as the my kitchen that's one one
thing<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.180> does<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.650> for<00:04:56.650> every<00:04:56.950> gram<00:04:57.220> of

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
thing it does and for every gram of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.240 
thing it does and for every gram of
glycogen<00:04:57.790> we<00:04:58.120> store<00:04:58.390> 3<00:04:58.720> grams<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.260> water<00:04:59.560> so

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
glycogen we store 3 grams of water so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.820 
glycogen we store 3 grams of water so
what<00:05:00.430> we<00:05:00.550> want<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.880> do<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.180> not<00:05:01.570> have<00:05:01.900> no<00:05:02.350> arms

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
what we want to do is not have no arms

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.190 
what we want to do is not have no arms
but<00:05:02.950> we<00:05:03.190> we<00:05:03.580> want<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.880> have<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.360> local

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
but we we want to have a local

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.290 
but we we want to have a local
and<00:05:05.520> carbohydrates<00:05:06.520> things<00:05:06.850> like<00:05:07.030> whole

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
and carbohydrates things like whole

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.420 
and carbohydrates things like whole
grains<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:07.930> now<00:05:08.620> aren't<00:05:08.770> gonna<00:05:08.890> spike<00:05:09.250> our

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
grains and now aren't gonna spike our

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.520 
grains and now aren't gonna spike our
blood<00:05:09.640> sugar<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.900> will<00:05:11.080> give<00:05:11.200> us<00:05:11.230> energy

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
blood sugar and that will give us energy

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.460 
blood sugar and that will give us energy
to<00:05:11.770> go<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.190> distance<00:05:12.570> but<00:05:13.570> also<00:05:13.750> we<00:05:14.140> want<00:05:14.380> to

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
to go the distance but also we want to

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.100 
to go the distance but also we want to
have<00:05:14.620> not<00:05:14.950> in<00:05:15.520> excess<00:05:16.120> we<00:05:16.450> want<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.750> have<00:05:16.960> it

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
have not in excess we want to have it

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.750 
have not in excess we want to have it
and<00:05:17.320> then<00:05:17.440> we<00:05:17.530> want<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.770> burn<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.070> energy

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
and then we want to burn that energy

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.090 
and then we want to burn that energy
right<00:05:19.000> away<00:05:19.270> through<00:05:19.930> our<00:05:20.200> exercise<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:21.070> we

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
right away through our exercise so we

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.980 
right away through our exercise so we
don't<00:05:21.280> want<00:05:21.400> to<00:05:21.430> hold<00:05:21.670> on<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.450> we<00:05:22.780> want

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
don't want to hold on to it so we want

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.050 
don't want to hold on to it so we want
to<00:05:23.080> have<00:05:23.230> minimize<00:05:23.860> some<00:05:24.460> of<00:05:24.580> those<00:05:24.700> and<00:05:25.030> just

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
to have minimize some of those and just

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.300 
to have minimize some of those and just
notice<00:05:25.690> how<00:05:25.810> you<00:05:25.870> feel<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.530> again<00:05:27.010> getting

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
notice how you feel and again getting

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.890 
notice how you feel and again getting
back<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:27.790> intolerance<00:05:28.480> if<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:28.690> have<00:05:28.870> a

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
back to that intolerance if you have a

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.600 
back to that intolerance if you have a
movement<00:05:29.230> intolerance<00:05:29.920> that<00:05:29.980> can<00:05:30.370> be<00:05:30.520> an

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
movement intolerance that can be an

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.700 
movement intolerance that can be an
issue<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:31.600> you'll<00:05:31.750> want<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.110> avoid

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
issue that you'll want to avoid

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.090 
issue that you'll want to avoid
and<00:05:32.830> lastly<00:05:33.690> toxicity<00:05:34.690> we<00:05:35.410> are<00:05:35.530> exposed<00:05:35.950> to
