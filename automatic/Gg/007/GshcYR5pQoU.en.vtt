00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is yerba mate.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The roots of chimarrão (South American traditional tea)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My name is Miguel Clestes Saldanha

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I was born and raised in Venâncio Aires

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I plant yucca, corn, bean

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and yerba mate.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It starts with the seed, right? You take the seed, ready the plant beds, spread them.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Until the seed is ready to be planted it takes around a year and a half.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You gotta get the machete and go to the tree.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The best way is to clean the smaller branches with your hand and the thicker ones you cut and lay them on the the cloth.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you want to break it with your hand, you can.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's tough work. Sunrise to sunset.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
My name is Valdir Oliveira. I have had a seeding nursery since 1989. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We harvest the seed from February to March in the plantations around this area. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We put the seed in the earth to wake it up and make it softer. The seed of the yerba mate is very hard.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
After six months we plant them in the bags or we sow them in the plant beds. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
My name is Selson Luiz Scherer. I have worked with Yerba Mate since I was young.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I was raised in this environment. Today I work with drying the leaves.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The yerba comes from the crops and goes to the "sapeco", which consists of putting the leaves directly on fire.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And then it goes to the dryer that dries the stick and the leaf, then goes to the sieves, where the stick goes to one side and the rest goes to the sacks.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
My name is João Batista de Souza, I live in the Palanque of Venâncio Aires and I compress yerba.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm a yerba compressor.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It arrives green upstairs. I then drop the yerba, it goes up to the mill,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
through the silo and I take it out. It is ground and mix then and I put in the compressor.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It's compressed to become more green and you get more foam in the Chimarrão.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That's why we compress it. It get's smaller, you know? When it's only ground it's not as good.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You have to compress it. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm satisfied because it passed through my hands. We made it with a lot care.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm proud of my land. I planted it all with my own hands and I'm proud of it. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I like making yerba. I feel good in this job. Very proud.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
They say the gaucho that doesn't drink Chimarrão is not a real gaucho.
