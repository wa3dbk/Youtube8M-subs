has to match the numbers so one so one
frog<00:00:31.260> goes<00:00:31.470> into<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> pond<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.820> about<00:00:33.059> this

one

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
one

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
one
two<00:00:34.739> frogs<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.790> okay<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.180> have

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
two frogs will go here okay and I have

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.760 
two frogs will go here okay and I have
velcro<00:00:36.510> taped<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> pond<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.540> well<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.140> back

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
velcro taped on the pond as well as back

velcro taped on the pond as well as back
of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> Frog<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.719> becomes<00:00:42.989> easier<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of the Frog so it becomes easier for the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
of the Frog so it becomes easier for the
kids<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.059> don't<00:00:45.149> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
kids but you can if you don't have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
kids but you can if you don't have
velcro<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.410> slowly<00:00:46.829> skip<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> okay

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
velcro you can just slowly skip it okay

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 
velcro you can just slowly skip it okay
so<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> three<00:00:48.870> frogs<00:00:49.320> go<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> pond<00:00:50.610> so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so the three frogs go into the pond so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.900 
so the three frogs go into the pond so
this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> such<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> great<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.910> teaching

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this is such a great way for teaching

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.630 
this is such a great way for teaching
them<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.780> concept<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.410> counting<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.430> math

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
them the concept of counting in math

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.590 
them the concept of counting in math
okay<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.420> number<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:59.270> then<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
okay so that's number one then here I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
okay so that's number one then here I
have<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.789> sorting<00:01:02.789> activity<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.600> here
