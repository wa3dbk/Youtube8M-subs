 so let 's go 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.509
 The boom is a very unusual one 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.369
 but still very cool packaging 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.680
 push the carton upwards 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.480
 you can open the cylinder and 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.189
 you get the entire scope of delivery 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.320
 beautifully presented how to easily 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.739
 The ibx can see around the middle 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.110
 on 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.870
 above you will find a round guide 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.430
 including a yellow charging cable then one 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.230
 small rubber cap for the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.480
 connections and so good last yet 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.829
 Warranty information in the bottom 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 slide is there also 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.539
 power plug with an eu and character 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.120
 is the speaker just in the 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.370
 color combination took superhero in 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.500
 which the fabric yes fabric around the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.140
 Speakers around blue and the rubber 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.820
 Elements of red are the speaker there 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 but also in innumerable others 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.630
 Colors such as black and blue 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.310
 yellow green pink red red violet white and 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.869
 a few others but variations 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.149
 here is definitely something for everyone 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.940
 from simple to extreme 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.860
 colorful by design like the uno 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.470
 In any case, I'm already very much 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.569
 the fabric is something original and 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.459
 in rubber not only look good, but 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.860
 make the speaker even more water 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.709
 and dirt repellent with the standard ip 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.289
 x4, but this is also 100 percent 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.789
 Given is the rubber cover 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.310
 which I deliver above all 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.380
 I've used this masked on 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.300
 the pawls and micro usb input 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.899
 which is there to load on the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.550
 bottom 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.619
 There is also a small hook 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.090
 with which one flowers to the july 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.599
 attach it to your backpack 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.789
 can 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.940
 on the top we still have 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.130
 a on and off button and a button around 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.330
 to start the coupling you want the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.130
 regulate the volume 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.830
 so you can be so good for 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.369
 unfilmable big buttons on the side 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.050
 make the july boom is super light with 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.399
 538 grams is not possible but 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.869
 still in the frame 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.810
 for coupling you can of course once 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.730
 bluetooth but also nfc is use 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 with a music listen to the whopping 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.140
 15 hours that is really very long 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.830
 But you still want the akkustand 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.900
 knowledge 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.450
 so you just have to do the plus and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.040
 tap minus button at the same time and then 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.829
 hear 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.989
 charged by the cylindrical design 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.629
 and the doubt built performance 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.980
 Speaker is a 360 degree sound 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.260
 experience possible 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.450
 no matter where you stand you always get the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.650
 full sound and sound we will 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.109
 already with the correct keyword 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.420
 this is really extremely good the heights 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.510
 come across extremely clear as well as the middle 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.250
 double pass your coils make sure that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.109
 the room is filled with bass 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.849
 and so you do not need the july booming 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.459
 to put on a table necessarily 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.170
 to exploit his full potential 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.750
 Finally, I would like to briefly on the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.750
 ebu map we can handle this 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.129
 two booms a stereo couple put one 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.280
 set equalizer 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.359
 Use dany boon as an alarm clock and this one 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.430
 still remotely controlled 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.099
 Finally, I can say that I know the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.290
 ibu does not like it very much and so do I. 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.480

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.409

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.689

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.680
