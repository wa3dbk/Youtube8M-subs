 production gelatin is used 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.900
 but that is not on it for humans 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.849
 those from ethical or religious 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 to abstain from meat 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.949
 is that a problem they demand one 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.380
 clear marking and one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 Legal protection of the terms vegan 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.550

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 he wants to look very carefully because in 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.879
 are some herbal product 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.129
 animal ingredients or additives 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.050
 hidden consumer protectors are there 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.050
 always surprising discoveries 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.159
 you will get three products in soup inside 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.400
 Find a wide picture sauce here 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.170
 Prepared with bacon gelatin is a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.799
 Classics you will always find in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.439
 easy products but also in 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.509
 gummy sweets one 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 unpleasant surprise also experienced 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 the green animal protection spokeswoman and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 vegetarian christiane brunner 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.340
 I'm bought nibbles 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.650
 then in order to house us can put up 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 and also eaten and then afterwards 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.250
 it came on that the animal fat 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.170
 were inside and that is for 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.939
 vegetarian and vegan, of course 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 extremely unpleasant because, first, the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.620
 not so well represented and secondly 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.900
 just do not want to eat 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.580
 on the ingredient list only need 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.800
 certain animal ingredients 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.050
 be listed and only then 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.660
 if they are detectable in the end product 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.090
 for technical assistance animal 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.920
 this does not apply to you 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 the production of a food 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.220
 but are not used in the end product 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.740
 more included 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 this is mainly about the latin 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.940
 from cattle and pigs 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 the food industry uses them 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.850
 like to clarify liquids like 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.160
 about it beer to juice and wine and even 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.010
 mineral waters are processed with it 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.600
 as a consumer one experiences in the end in the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.490
 content but none of it 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.640
 you can imagine that to the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.920
 for example a drink that of course 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.440
 certain suspended solids and dyes and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.600
 has various ingredients for the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.130
 Consumers for the consumers visually 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.630
 should be upgraded to that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.430
 For example, the fluid becomes clearer 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.700
 or a certain hue is achieved 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.560
 Now you lead into this vat where the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.290
 Be produced drinks 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.150
 gelatin to the gelatin sticks together 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.739
 then with the suspended matter with the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.380
 dyes and the whole thing will be 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.750
 exhausted and left, so to speak 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:02.430
 then the clear or nicely colored 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.890
 liquid problem so people the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.110
 deliberately no canon switzerland 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.450
 want to buy complete or no desert 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.160
 just do not want in the drinks any 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.530
 participation of gelatin 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.780
 I can understand that as well 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.120
 vegan calls felix hnat clear 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.400
 Marks the observer of the vegans 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.590
 society of Austria knows by means of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.690
 Company information where animal 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.310
 auxiliary materials are used and where 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.989
 Not 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.019
 the apple juice for me right now 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.620
 he did not drink with swords 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.720
 clarified and this product according to information 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.629
 It is quite possible for the producer 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.690
 that statin is used for clarification 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.510
 just as with the mineral waters that for 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.500
 laura mineral water here 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.420
 It will not be faster 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.819
 clarified and loud information from 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.909
 Römmerquelle may be the product of this product 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.650
 here is completely paper is the 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.239
 actually easy in Austria 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.340
 because the Austrian beer after the 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.379
 to be brewed that is 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.879
 Only certain ingredients may be used 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.620
 become 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.299
 The Irish beer here for example becomes 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.040
 traditionally with fish bubble 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.920
 clarified so there are so to speak the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.060
 suspended solids with fish components 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.709
 executed vegetarian organizations 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.109
 have with individual producers 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.970
 Voluntary license plate develops one 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.130
 However, first directions are 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.650
 Consumers here on the information of the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.389
 manufacturer instructed a legal 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.039
 Protect the label in vegan and 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.660
 vegetarian with appropriate 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.870
 There are no checks 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.539
 the eu parliament in 2010 to a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.729
 By definition , the EU Commission decided 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.470
 but was able to none today 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.450
 labeling regulation 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.490
 the commission merely notes 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.710
 that company consumers with the 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.599
 terms vegan and vegetarian 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.460
 should not be misleading 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.349
 That's definitely meat denial 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.490
 too little they demand one 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.950
 Austrian seal of approval our 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.330
 demand is very clear we have too 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.910
 already one and a half years ago 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.680
 appropriate request that just 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.400
 the products are clearly marked 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.900
 should 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.430
 So I think that I think at all 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.780
 that a seal of approval should give 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.789
 state seal of approval 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.560
 but it would also be possible 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.090
 identify products 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.740
 that also according to the 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.199
 provide appropriate controls 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.880
 is guaranteed and vegetarian and 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.070
 vegan can rely on it 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.479
 that guarantees a vegetarian 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.769
 or a vegan product 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.719
 Minister of Health alois stöger is 

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:31.550
 in principle also for a seal of approval 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.729
 Nevertheless, he wants an eu order 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.300
 we wait that at the earliest 2014 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.179
 give 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.580
 vegans and vegetarians will be too 

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:43.749
 continue to eat food very carefully 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.749
 have to take the magnifying glass
