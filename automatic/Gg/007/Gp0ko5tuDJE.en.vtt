of<00:04:17.799> bring<00:04:18.010> out<00:04:18.130> everything<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:18.700> your<00:04:18.789> photo<00:04:19.090> so

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
of bring out everything in your photo so

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.569 
of bring out everything in your photo so
let's<00:04:19.650> see<00:04:20.650> if<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:20.799> kind<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.220> go<00:04:21.310> into<00:04:21.459> the

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
let's see if I can kind of go into the

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.290 
let's see if I can kind of go into the
camera<00:04:21.820> roll<00:04:22.120> here<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.630> choose<00:04:23.140> a<00:04:24.030> scene<00:04:25.030> here

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
camera roll here and choose a scene here

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.320 
camera roll here and choose a scene here
so<00:04:28.830> see<00:04:29.830> if<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.039> see<00:04:30.280> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
so see if you can see that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.580 
so see if you can see that
so<00:04:31.900> basically<00:04:32.229> what<00:04:32.919> we've<00:04:33.039> got<00:04:33.220> here<00:04:33.250> is<00:04:33.460> a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
so basically what we've got here is a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.899 
so basically what we've got here is a
playground<00:04:35.590> area<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:36.009> a<00:04:36.039> sky<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.669> sky<00:04:36.759> is

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
playground area with a sky the sky is

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.589 
playground area with a sky the sky is
pretty<00:04:37.180> white<00:04:37.569> and<00:04:37.870> washed<00:04:38.080> out<00:04:39.419> but<00:04:40.419> if<00:04:40.509> you

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
pretty white and washed out but if you

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.600 
pretty white and washed out but if you
go<00:04:40.689> to<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.870> next<00:04:41.050> area<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.680> next<00:04:41.889> one<00:04:42.039> exact

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
go to the next area the next one exact

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.300 
go to the next area the next one exact
same<00:04:42.819> photo<00:04:43.150> this<00:04:43.629> is<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> HDR<00:04:44.229> version<00:04:44.830> you

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
same photo this is the HDR version you

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.830 
same photo this is the HDR version you
can<00:04:45.400> see<00:04:45.580> more<00:04:45.759> of<00:04:45.819> the<00:04:45.909> sky<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.419> can<00:04:46.539> see<00:04:46.629> kind

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
can see more of the sky you can see kind

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.619 
can see more of the sky you can see kind
of<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> Sun<00:04:47.319> in<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.560> back<00:04:47.710> run<00:04:47.889> in<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.069> clouds

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
of the Sun in the back run in the clouds

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.390 
of the Sun in the back run in the clouds
more<00:04:49.629> of<00:04:49.719> detail<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.229> ground<00:04:50.439> go<00:04:51.250> back

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
more of detail on the ground go back

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.510 
more of detail on the ground go back
again<00:04:51.810> ground<00:04:52.810> is<00:04:52.930> kind<00:04:53.199> of<00:04:53.289> over<00:04:53.949> saturated

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
again ground is kind of over saturated

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.950 
again ground is kind of over saturated
this<00:04:54.639> guy<00:04:54.789> is<00:04:54.849> definitely<00:04:55.210> all<00:04:55.689> white<00:04:56.159> go<00:04:57.159> back

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
this guy is definitely all white go back

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.300 
this guy is definitely all white go back
so<00:04:58.960> that's<00:04:59.139> what<00:04:59.259> it<00:04:59.289> does<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.650> basically<00:05:00.039> you

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
so that's what it does and basically you

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.830 
so that's what it does and basically you
can<00:05:00.490> choose<00:05:00.909> to<00:05:00.939> have<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.659> phone<00:05:02.229> either<00:05:02.530> save

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
can choose to have the phone either save

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.379 
can choose to have the phone either save
just<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.990> h<00:05:05.139> er<00:05:05.469> version<00:05:05.919> or<00:05:06.129> if<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.120> do<00:05:07.240> take

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
just the h er version or if you do take

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.149 
just the h er version or if you do take
an<00:05:07.539> HDR<00:05:07.870> photo<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.349> can<00:05:08.469> save<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.800> original

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
an HDR photo it can save the original

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.010 
an HDR photo it can save the original
and<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.430> HDR<00:05:09.849> which<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:11.409> kind<00:05:12.069> of<00:05:12.250> recommend

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
and the HDR which I kind of recommend

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.089 
and the HDR which I kind of recommend
because<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.110> can<00:05:14.229> always<00:05:14.349> delete<00:05:14.560> them<00:05:14.830> later

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
because you can always delete them later

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.209 
because you can always delete them later
but<00:05:15.900> like<00:05:16.900> here's<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.169> picture<00:05:17.319> of<00:05:17.409> my<00:05:17.560> son<00:05:17.949> I

messed up so that's obviously not what I
would<00:05:35.919> want<00:05:36.129> if<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.370> was<00:05:36.520> only<00:05:36.729> taking<00:05:37.000> hgr

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
takes a moment to save the HDR version

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.519 
takes a moment to save the HDR version
before<00:05:51.009> you<00:05:51.219> can<00:05:51.339> take<00:05:51.490> another<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:52.449> so<00:05:53.379> if<00:05:53.469> i
