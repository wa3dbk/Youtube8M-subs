00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
but from what I can see it looks as

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.960 
but from what I can see it looks as
though<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.800> iron<00:02:01.009> sights<00:02:01.369> will<00:02:01.580> all<00:02:01.759> be

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
though the iron sights will all be

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.020 
though the iron sights will all be
fairly<00:02:02.360> open<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.050> easy<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.500> use<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.880> can

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
fairly open and easy to use as you can

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.699 
fairly open and easy to use as you can
see<00:02:08.270> from<00:02:08.420> what's<00:02:08.630> going<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:08.989> in<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.229> game<00:02:09.440> and

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
see from what's going on in the game and

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.890 
see from what's going on in the game and
on<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.130> mini-map<00:02:10.399> helicopters<00:02:11.239> look<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.750> be

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
on the mini-map helicopters look to be

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.990 
on the mini-map helicopters look to be
returning<00:02:12.709> as<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.860> kill<00:02:13.220> streak<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.730> because

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
returning as a kill streak and because

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.550 
returning as a kill streak and because
we've<00:02:14.150> already<00:02:14.360> seen<00:02:14.720> three<00:02:14.989> killstreaks

we've already seen three killstreaks

we've already seen three killstreaks
already<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.310> would<00:02:16.519> lead<00:02:16.700> us<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.850> believe

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
already this would lead us to believe

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.759 
already this would lead us to believe
that<00:02:17.420> custom<00:02:17.840> field<00:02:18.080> streaks<00:02:18.320> will<00:02:18.470> be<00:02:18.620> making

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
that custom field streaks will be making

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.840 
that custom field streaks will be making
a<00:02:18.980> return<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.459> black<00:02:19.670> ops<00:02:21.459> right<00:02:22.459> here<00:02:22.730> we

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
a return in black ops right here we

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.640 
a return in black ops right here we
actually<00:02:23.239> get<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.420> see<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.900> kill<00:02:24.170> streaks<00:02:24.500> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
actually get to see to kill streaks and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.100 
actually get to see to kill streaks and
use<00:02:24.799> both<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.430> RC<00:02:25.940> car<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.480> explodes<00:02:26.930> but

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
use both the RC car that explodes but

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.170 
use both the RC car that explodes but
also<00:02:27.320> look<00:02:27.650> above<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.549> appears<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> be

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
also look above it that appears to be

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.780 
also look above it that appears to be
the<00:02:29.299> five<00:02:29.810> kill<00:02:30.200> streak<00:02:30.620> missile<00:02:31.250> because

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
the five kill streak missile because

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.150 
the five kill streak missile because
look<00:02:32.030> at<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.299> hard<00:02:32.810> left<00:02:33.140> turn<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.650> takes<00:02:33.860> here

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
look at the hard left turn it takes here

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.030 
look at the hard left turn it takes here
it<00:02:34.280> appears<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.390> has<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.260> player

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
it appears that that has to be player

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.240 
it appears that that has to be player
guided<00:02:37.670> rather<00:02:38.180> than<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.480> random<00:02:38.870> turn<00:02:39.410> similar

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
guided rather than a random turn similar

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.550 
guided rather than a random turn similar
to<00:02:40.400> what<00:02:40.580> an<00:02:40.670> RPG<00:02:41.360> would<00:02:41.630> do

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.750 

right<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.770> we<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.010> see<00:02:50.160> an<00:02:50.280> air<00:02:50.490> strike

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
right here we can see an air strike

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.430 
right here we can see an air strike
being<00:02:51.000> called<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.510> making<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.140> fifth

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
being called in making this the fifth

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.260 
being called in making this the fifth
killstreak<00:02:53.040> being<00:02:53.250> featured<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.000> video

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
leading us once again to believe that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.210 
leading us once again to believe that
custom<00:02:57.270> killstreaks<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:58.350> be<00:02:58.530> returning<00:02:59.070> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
custom killstreaks will be returning to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.370 
custom killstreaks will be returning to
black<00:02:59.430> ops<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:05.270> again<00:03:06.270> here<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:06.690> see<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.080> five

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
black ops and again here we see the five

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
black ops and again here we see the five
killstreak<00:03:08.040> missile<00:03:08.430> coming<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.120> looks<00:03:09.600> to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
killstreak missile coming in it looks to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.570 
killstreak missile coming in it looks to
be<00:03:09.870> similar<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.410> predator<00:03:10.830> missile<00:03:11.220> except

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
be similar to a predator missile except

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.340 
be similar to a predator missile except
the<00:03:11.700> player<00:03:11.910> has<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:12.480> more<00:03:12.510> control<00:03:13.320> over

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350

the player has much more control over
