00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
want to get full void void range for

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.390 
want to get full void void range for
when<00:02:16.849> i<00:02:16.879> start<00:02:17.269> shinning<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:18.499> course<00:02:18.829> once<00:02:19.249> i

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
when i start shinning of course once i

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.220 
when i start shinning of course once i
get<00:02:19.609> like<00:02:19.790> 80<00:02:20.120> range<00:02:20.569> i'm<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:21.079> start

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
get like 80 range i'm going to start

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.509 
get like 80 range i'm going to start
chinning<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.829> of<00:02:21.889> course<00:02:22.099> i<00:02:22.189> want<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> have

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
chinning and of course i want to have

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.309 
chinning and of course i want to have
full<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.849> way<00:02:22.909> for<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.629> i<00:02:23.659> might<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.109> like

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
full the way for that so i might do like

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.959 
full the way for that so i might do like
a<00:02:24.349> couple<00:02:24.739> days<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.099> just<00:02:25.249> powering<00:02:25.609> out<00:02:25.790> some

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
a couple days of just powering out some

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.390 
a couple days of just powering out some
pest<00:02:26.209> control<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.749> we'll<00:02:26.840> see<00:02:26.989> how<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.260> goes<00:02:27.409> i

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
pest control and we'll see how it goes i

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.420 
pest control and we'll see how it goes i
am<00:02:28.819> 72<00:02:29.510> combat<00:02:30.170> now<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> can<00:02:30.950> get<00:02:31.099> on<00:02:31.159> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
am 72 combat now so I can get on the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.099 
am 72 combat now so I can get on the
intermediate<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.329> I<00:02:32.359> remember<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:32.989> tried

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
intermediate one I remember I tried

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.740 
intermediate one I remember I tried
before<00:02:33.500> I'm<00:02:33.889> the<00:02:34.099> small<00:02:34.370> 1i<00:02:34.609> h<00:02:35.359> sock

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
before I'm the small 1i h sock

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.229 
before I'm the small 1i h sock
so<00:02:36.109> I<00:02:36.319> might<00:02:36.769> be<00:02:36.889> doing<00:02:37.040> some<00:02:37.489> pest<00:02:37.909> control

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
so I might be doing some pest control

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.709 
so I might be doing some pest control
later<00:02:38.420> getting<00:02:38.900> debt<00:02:39.109> avoid<00:02:39.950> range<00:02:40.219> I<00:02:40.719> void

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
later getting debt avoid range I void

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.899 
later getting debt avoid range I void
range<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.139> gonna<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.469> worth<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.829> like<00:02:42.980> it's

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
range is gonna be worth it like it's

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.030 
range is gonna be worth it like it's
more<00:02:44.480> worth<00:02:44.719> it<00:02:44.930> for<00:02:45.139> the<00:02:45.230> efficiency<00:02:46.010> of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
more worth it for the efficiency of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.309 
more worth it for the efficiency of
chinning<00:02:46.639> rather<00:02:46.909> than<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.629> efficiency

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
chinning rather than like the efficiency

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.379 
chinning rather than like the efficiency
of<00:02:48.349> getting<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:48.919> cuz<00:02:49.099> like<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.669> do<00:02:49.849> get<00:02:50.030> comedy

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
of getting it cuz like you do get comedy

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.110 
of getting it cuz like you do get comedy
it's<00:02:50.599> me<00:02:50.750> get<00:02:51.169> some<00:02:51.349> cash<00:02:51.709> from<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.189> so<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.549> guess

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
it's me get some cash from it so I guess

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.699 
it's me get some cash from it so I guess
it's<00:02:53.150> gonna<00:02:53.419> be<00:02:53.510> worth<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.959> since<00:02:54.139> I<00:02:54.319> did<00:02:54.469> spend

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
it's gonna be worth it since I did spend

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.159 
it's gonna be worth it since I did spend

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
in 06 unfortunately but whatever um what

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.230 
in 06 unfortunately but whatever um what
I'm<00:04:42.930> trying<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.380> think<00:04:44.540> what<00:04:45.540> was<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.870> 07

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
I'm trying to think what was the 07

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.140 
I'm trying to think what was the 07
Christmas<00:04:48.590> thing<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.190> Ossa<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.730> think

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
Christmas thing and the Ossa I think

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.480 
Christmas thing and the Ossa I think
that<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.390> 07<00:04:51.810> halloween<00:04:52.500> event<00:04:52.800> was<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.040> Grim

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
that the 07 halloween event was the Grim

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.240 
that the 07 halloween event was the Grim
Reaper<00:04:53.880> hood<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.530> might<00:04:55.530> be<00:04:55.680> wrong<00:04:55.860> about<00:04:56.100> that

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
Reaper hood I might be wrong about that

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.830 
Reaper hood I might be wrong about that
and<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.870> think<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.530> 07<00:04:59.370> Christmas<00:05:00.360> event

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
and I think that the 07 Christmas event

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.130 
and I think that the 07 Christmas event
was<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.910> snow<00:05:02.910> globe<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.360> wanna<00:05:03.600> say<00:05:03.870> I

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
was the snow globe I wanna say I

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.610 
was the snow globe I wanna say I
honestly<00:05:04.920> don't<00:05:05.100> know<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:06.080> cannot<00:05:07.080> keep<00:05:07.320> track

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
honestly don't know I cannot keep track
