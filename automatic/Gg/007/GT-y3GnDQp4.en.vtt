building a nine dollar computer called

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.410 
building a nine dollar computer called
chip<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.619> basically<00:00:25.859> leverages<00:00:26.580> high

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
chip here which basically leverages high

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.759

a single board computer that runs Debian

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
a single board computer that runs Debian
Linux<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.750> basically<00:00:36.750> allows<00:00:37.020> us<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> offer

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Linux and basically allows us to offer

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.799 
Linux and basically allows us to offer
it<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.739> nine<00:00:37.950> dollars<00:00:38.239> that's<00:00:39.239> great<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it for nine dollars that's great so the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.209 
it for nine dollars that's great so the
Debian<00:00:40.110> Linux<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> package<00:00:41.070> that

ok<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.540> me<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.020> looking<00:01:55.140> at

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
ok so for me like I was looking at

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.260 
ok so for me like I was looking at
displays<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.520> I've<00:01:56.610> hooked<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
displays and I've hooked them up and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389 
displays and I've hooked them up and
it's<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.170> complicated<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> few

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it's not complicated but there's a few

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's not complicated but there's a few
different<00:01:59.700> options<00:01:59.759> can<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.210> walk<00:02:00.360> through

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
different options can you walk through

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.469 
different options can you walk through
that<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.750> bit<00:02:00.840> sure<00:02:01.259> yeah<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.060> most

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that a bit sure yeah so the the most

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.359 
that a bit sure yeah so the the most
hack<00:02:03.780> early<00:02:04.079> level<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:05.040> connecting

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
hack early level is actually connecting

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.399 
hack early level is actually connecting
a<00:02:05.549> parallel<00:02:06.240> LCD<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.259> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
a parallel LCD which is what we have

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
a parallel LCD which is what we have
here<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.710> pocket<00:02:08.069> chip<00:02:08.250> ok<00:02:08.819> directly<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
here on pocket chip ok directly to the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.300 
here on pocket chip ok directly to the
pins<00:02:09.989> those<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.319> being<00:02:10.440> driven<00:02:10.649> straight<00:02:11.160> off

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
pins those are being driven straight off

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.789 
pins those are being driven straight off
of<00:02:11.340> our<00:02:11.610> process

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
of our process

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.920 
of our process
or<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.700> also<00:02:13.819> put<00:02:14.060> an<00:02:14.150> adapter<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.900> this

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
or you can also put an adapter like this

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.440 
or you can also put an adapter like this
vga<00:02:15.439> board<00:02:15.799> which<00:02:16.340> takes<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.819> parallel<00:02:17.180> CD

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
vga board which takes that parallel CD

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.050 
vga board which takes that parallel CD
and<00:02:17.689> adapts<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.409> through<00:02:19.010> some<00:02:19.159> through<00:02:19.939> some

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
and adapts it through some through some

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.600 
and adapts it through some through some
chips<00:02:20.209> out<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.599> VGA<00:02:21.319> output<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.459> can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
chips out to a VGA output so you can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.729 
chips out to a VGA output so you can
connect<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.060> standard<00:02:23.360> monitor<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.379> your

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
connect it to a standard monitor so your

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.369 
connect it to a standard monitor so your
options<00:02:25.129> for<00:02:25.340> outputs<00:02:25.760> monitors<00:02:26.379> composite

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
options for outputs monitors composite

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.600 
options for outputs monitors composite
through<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.650> headphone<00:02:27.950> jack<00:02:28.629> VGA<00:02:29.629> HDMI<00:02:30.610> or

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
through the headphone jack VGA HDMI or

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.240 
through the headphone jack VGA HDMI or
attached<00:02:32.599> LCD<00:02:33.049> well<00:02:33.709> that's<00:02:33.860> great<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.190> if

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
attached LCD well that's great so if

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.920 
attached LCD well that's great so if
people<00:02:34.430> wanted<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.879> make<00:02:35.000> their<00:02:35.180> own<00:02:35.450> table

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930

basically<00:03:13.609> our<00:03:14.230> our<00:03:15.230> sort<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.590> Nod<00:03:16.629> not<00:03:17.629> to<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
basically our our sort of Nod not to the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.449 
basically our our sort of Nod not to the
clicky<00:03:18.620> key<00:03:19.030> pda's<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.329> past<00:03:21.459> resistive

TFT<00:03:26.199> basically<00:03:27.199> it's<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.349> monitor<00:03:28.040> and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
TFT basically it's a monitor and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.970 
TFT basically it's a monitor and
keyboard<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:29.030> chip<00:03:29.419> pops<00:03:29.810> into<00:03:30.109> okay<00:03:30.680> it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
keyboard that chip pops into okay it

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.729 
keyboard that chip pops into okay it
provides<00:03:31.340> power<00:03:32.269> something<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.319> can<00:03:33.440> hold<00:03:33.620> on

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
provides power something you can hold on

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.979 
provides power something you can hold on
to<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.370> breakout<00:03:34.699> for<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:34.940> GPIO<00:03:35.329> s<00:03:35.510> makes

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
to and a breakout for the GPIO s makes

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.509 
to and a breakout for the GPIO s makes
it<00:03:36.109> really<00:03:36.230> easy<00:03:36.349> to<00:03:36.590> get<00:03:36.680> started<00:03:36.949> with<00:03:37.160> chip

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
it really easy to get started with chip

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.390 
it really easy to get started with chip
add<00:03:38.090> sensors<00:03:38.540> build<00:03:39.109> projects<00:03:39.620> around<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:40.069> all

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
add sensors build projects around it all

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.099 
add sensors build projects around it all
of<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.669> and<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.389> have<00:03:41.720> something<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.049> you

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
of that and I have something that you

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.720 
of that and I have something that you
can<00:03:42.230> carry<00:03:42.410> around<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.010> world<00:03:43.190> okay

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
can carry around in the world okay

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.339
