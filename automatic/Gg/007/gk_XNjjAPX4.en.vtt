00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 to present liquids 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.150
 is called 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 our first liquid our liquid 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.470
 number 2 thanks 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.190
 we have alcohol and we have water is going to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.810
 put good boys 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:39.150
 so that it happens 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:41.220
 the hamburgers the hamburgers what 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.100
 we are going to paint a little bit so that you observe 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.630
 here as what is above there is a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
 air that tells us what is up 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.309
 low let's see if it's up low if 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.309
 let's use the atmospheric pressure 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.760
 in a letter 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.040
 if we make an approach 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.620
 and if we make a blender 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.240
 what's up low ok but it's going to 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.440
 exit full or you will stay there 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 there was a second experiment here 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.970
 it shows that what was 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.840
 electric by the current my son 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.430
 let's go again we're going to use the pressure 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.910
 atmospheric 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.450
 and what goes down goes up well what is under 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.450
 it goes up 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.950
 in the last ok allows sides then 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.060
 sides 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.060
 has numbers if it is organized has 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.330
 inverted for her please 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.550
 or not 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.849
 We have been 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.659
 although seriously please know 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.659
 well at least 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.300
 then I commented on the video works and 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.300
 videos that inform us 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.630
 but observe very well again we are going 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.960
 to block 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.660
 purple now purple let's go bring 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.660
 everything you want is working well 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.600
 and we are going to show that they do not go down 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.750
 these brains 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.000
 to the densities of the water with a 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.660
 density of 1,000 kilograms per each 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.660
 cubic meter 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:43.790
 that explains while alcohol 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.140
 have those little beards we would like 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.840
 have them alcohol that a density 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.380
 to look like the doctor in alaska if 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.380
 I have them 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.840
 working with crazy liquids like you 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.350
 you will understand I am working with him and 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.350
 with water 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.820
 every Monday you have an appointment with 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.820
 we teachers here on night tv 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.530
 the moment to see who won who goes to 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.200
 win 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.690
 remember that the first participant 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.060
 did the wine factory do 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.460
 wonders like dried wine and pulled 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:44.470
 came that way although we would drink 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:48.669
 experiments and the second participant 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.669
 electromagnetism look at it 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.520
 samuel barrier physics teacher 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.800
 is the chemistry professor alejandro 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:14.819
 barrier that as endured rod maybe not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.819
 you gave him of passed boy 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:27.050
 so well I'm going to say the name of 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:29.310
 the winners and the first one is 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.080
 we will be winning 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.520
 heaven 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.520
 samuel barrier 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.449
 but in the second the second winner 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.229
 and the name of the scientist who continues 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.229
 in our competition 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:51.809
 yes you can if you can open 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.589
 Alejandro Bar
