would be a veneer that would be placed

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.060 
would be a veneer that would be placed
over<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.880> part<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.060> this<00:01:23.240> case<00:01:23.479> aluminum<00:01:24.170> with

before the final veneer piece if we were

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.760 
before the final veneer piece if we were
making<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.670> wheel<00:01:35.180> for<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.630> lined<00:01:36.140> oak<00:01:36.380> we<00:01:36.620> would

making a wheel for a lined oak we would

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.480 
making a wheel for a lined oak we would
start<00:01:37.040> with<00:01:37.100> solid<00:01:37.610> oak<00:01:38.830> lumber<00:01:39.830> not<00:01:40.070> veneer

start with solid oak lumber not veneer

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.270 
start with solid oak lumber not veneer
and<00:01:40.760> we<00:01:40.850> would<00:01:41.030> steam<00:01:41.299> Bend<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:41.979> into<00:01:42.979> shape

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
and we would steam Bend this into shape

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.950 
and we would steam Bend this into shape
and<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:43.640> mill<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.720> proper

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
and then mill it to the proper

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.070 
and then mill it to the proper
dimensions<00:01:45.740> for<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.010> steering<00:01:46.340> roller

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
you can see the wood is going to vary a

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.539 
you can see the wood is going to vary a
bit<00:02:21.879> both<00:02:22.879> American<00:02:23.480> walnut<00:02:23.719> but<00:02:24.549> obviously

this is the natural color of Zambrano

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
this is the natural color of Zambrano
zebra<00:02:38.700> wood<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.200> again<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.290> would<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.440> been

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
zebra wood and again it would have been

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.220 
zebra wood and again it would have been
veneer<00:02:40.980> over<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.550> substrate<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.630> make<00:02:42.840> if

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
veneer over this substrate if we make if

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.790 
veneer over this substrate if we make if
we<00:02:43.590> make<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:45.050> soprano<00:02:46.050> steering<00:02:46.500> wheel<00:02:46.650> we

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
we make a soprano steering wheel we

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.160 
we make a soprano steering wheel we
would<00:02:46.950> start<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.250> zebrano<00:02:48.090> lumber<00:02:48.570> just

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
would start with zebrano lumber just

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.090 
would start with zebrano lumber just
like<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> cherry<00:02:50.610> or<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.120> oak

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
like we would with the cherry or the oak

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.180 
like we would with the cherry or the oak
zebra<00:02:53.100> no<00:02:53.160> had<00:02:53.400> been<00:02:53.580> used<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.510> automobiles<00:02:55.350> by

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
zebra no had been used in automobiles by

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.260 
zebra no had been used in automobiles by
Mercedes<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.980> also<00:02:58.980> Escalade<00:02:59.700> uses<00:03:00.120> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
Mercedes and also Escalade uses of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.110 
Mercedes and also Escalade uses of
Renault<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:01.490> typically<00:03:02.490> what<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.850> did<00:03:03.000> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
Renault and typically what they did is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970 
Renault and typically what they did is
they<00:03:03.270> took<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.140> made<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.500> more<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.830> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
they took this and made it more of a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.980 
they took this and made it more of a
reddish<00:03:05.220> color<00:03:05.340> reddish<00:03:06.030> brown<00:03:06.270> color<00:03:06.300> as

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
reddish color reddish brown color as

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.750 
reddish color reddish brown color as
opposed<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.070> what<00:03:08.250> Land<00:03:09.060> Rover<00:03:09.360> did<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.750> this

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
opposed to what Land Rover did with this

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.810 
opposed to what Land Rover did with this
so<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.300> leads<00:03:12.630> up<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.110> simple<00:03:13.710> or<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> small

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
so this leads up to a simple or a small

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.110 
so this leads up to a simple or a small
job<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> customer<00:03:16.100> he<00:03:17.100> has<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.570> 2006<00:03:19.100> vintage

job for a customer he has a 2006 vintage
sport<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> he<00:03:21.600> doesn't<00:03:21.990> particularly<00:03:22.230> like

the<00:03:22.680> cherry<00:03:22.980> anymore<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.480> we<00:03:25.320> are<00:03:25.440> going

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the cherry anymore and so we are going

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.310
