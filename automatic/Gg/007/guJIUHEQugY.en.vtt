00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.240
 tells crowd of windows phone channel 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.910
 souza personal beauty 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.700
 this is the first video of 2015 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.860
 after a long time without recording I am 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.029
 here shooting back at you to 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.449
 to be able to talk about a specific 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.390
 nokia 1930 there were others in October and 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:40.379
 recording videos about it but they 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.620
 did not show why when 1930 he 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 very hot very very hot 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.920
 but one side only who has a 1930 knows 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.080
 that he gets very hot and when he 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.809
 it gets very hot it gets almost impossible 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.519
 You hold the phone in your hand, will not you? 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.540
 really bad really 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:04.199
 different from the 1925 that warms the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.850
 number 97 2011 1925 him when he 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.950
 heats up a lot he heats up in a way 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.710
 uniform where the whole phone is 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.659
 hot then the temperature of the phone 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.020
 925 final is lower than the owner 1930 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.060
 because the 1930's heat becomes specific in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 one side the sound of the device that is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.290
 side of the camera the heat only gets 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 in this square here your side 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.690
 specific here is the square of the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.660
 camera 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.090
 I'll show you why in 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.190
 1930 he warms up, however, only this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.200
 bit here remembering that I do not 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.850
 I blame you if you try to redo 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 this procedure that I'm going to do here 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.550
 now on your 925 930 reminding you that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.350
 Yes you can lose the guarantee of your 1930 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.300
 doing what I'm going to do here now 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.990
 I'm just going to do this so I can show 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.390
 to the bottom of you why the number 830 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.250
 it overheats one side of the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.000
 unit there going forward will 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.000
 explain why 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.599
 Good guys, we got here right, and I 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.849
 I removed the back cover of my nokia in 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.939
 1930 for those who want to know how it is 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.780
 one of the 930 inside the fifth lid of the 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:30.299
 part of the 930 solution the flash it still 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.209
 is coupled 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.000
 here we have the nfc antenna and here the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.220
 air charging antenna 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.750
 charging the device is only 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.400
 I'll show you volume button. 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.670
 it's on the side of here 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.620
 in 1930 it only overheats in this 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.849
 here we'll leave the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.030
 side cover 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.489
 here we have the camera are not you are 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.970
 camera chicken 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.519
 the battery-operated camera module of 1930 that 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.989
 by the way, it was very small and doing 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.760
 a comparison with the size of the battery 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.560
 everything was behind 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.730
 You can see how the lid she is. 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.510
 very small even battery between 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:16.919
 small size for example 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.430
 from a card here she's very little 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:22.440
 same but let's go for a video intent 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.930
 for those who do not see us here 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.090
 has a loud speaker from 1930 a way of 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.190
 that touches digital music and this 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.040
 little bits of tinny you are 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.299
 seeing here the link only reflected in the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.519
 I think the camera can not focus 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.769
 I do not know why but this piece of metal 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 here he is the cpu of the right phone 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.299
 this is where the snapdragon 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.250
 800 see here 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.590
 This small little square here is 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.909
 the snapdragon 800 of the device is 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.250
 device processor 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.459
 so that's why the 930 government 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:01.019
 It's very hot on one side, it's just 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.060
 where is the gpu cpu UN 1930 because you 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.680
 play a heavy game if you put a 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.979
 touch over near the camera lens 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.560
 It will not be hot though here and the gpu 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:13.319
 stay here it will be very hot 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.609
 and how the body of the device is all in 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.949
 aluminum and chassis in the 1930's in aluminum 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.989
 it helps a lot to dissipate heat're 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.590
 yes yes 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.750
 in 1930 and 50 quite quite even 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.330
 but it also has a facility that 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.729
 they cool much easier by 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.819
 fact that it is all aluminum and it is 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.430
 that the 1930 it heats up a lot and 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.590
 just this little bit here he heats up 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.889
 Very sure, folks. 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.080
 then the explanation is why I 930 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.729
 It's very hot and that's it folks for you 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.729
 liked the video and until the next 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.030
 i
