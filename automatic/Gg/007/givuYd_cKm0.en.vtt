00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
together to create something called a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.000 
together to create something called a
photo<00:00:59.850> manipulation<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.800> also

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
photo manipulation and that's also

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
photo manipulation and that's also
another<00:01:02.340> thing<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
graphics and now you can even create

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
graphics and now you can even create
sets<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.140> graphics<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.340> an

small areas because the user usability

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
small areas because the user usability
of<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> actually<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.130> pretty<00:01:39.119> easy<00:01:40.820> anybody

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820

can learn how to use it and it doesn't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.490 
can learn how to use it and it doesn't
it<00:01:44.970> cost<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.630> decent<00:01:45.960> amount<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> money<00:01:46.200> but

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it cost a decent amount of money but

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.980 
it cost a decent amount of money but
it's<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.460> expensive<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.299> people<00:01:48.750> can't

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's not so expensive that people can't

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
it's not so expensive that people can't
use<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.799> can't<00:01:50.100> buy<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:51.390> other

that are visual effects programs so it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 
that are visual effects programs so it's
a<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.790> popular<00:01:57.060> program<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.290> sure<00:01:58.500> most

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
a very popular program and I'm sure most

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.830 
a very popular program and I'm sure most
almost<00:01:59.100> everybody<00:01:59.729> has<00:01:59.880> heard<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.270> Photoshop
