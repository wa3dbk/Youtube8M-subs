00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.880 
that is protected or easily cleaned I'm
really<00:04:16.630> impressed<00:04:16.870> how<00:04:17.109> quickly<00:04:17.530> actually

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
really impressed how quickly actually

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.349 
really impressed how quickly actually
you're<00:04:18.160> easy<00:04:18.280> you're<00:04:18.669> able<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.000> find<00:04:19.180> your

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359

you're easy you're able to find your
size<00:04:19.570> right<00:04:20.019> well<00:04:20.680> what<00:04:21.010> helps<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.519> is<00:04:21.730> that

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
size right well what helps that is that

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.520 
size right well what helps that is that
all<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.300> sizes<00:04:22.540> have<00:04:22.900> numbers<00:04:23.320> on<00:04:23.470> them

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
all the sizes have numbers on them

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.860 
all the sizes have numbers on them
actually<00:04:23.860> so<00:04:24.430> once<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.180> get<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.450> hang<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.750> it

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
actually so once you get the hang of it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.720 
actually so once you get the hang of it
and<00:04:26.020> what<00:04:26.200> size<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.710> are<00:04:26.740> for<00:04:27.130> each<00:04:27.250> finger

and what size you are for each finger

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.250 
and what size you are for each finger
you<00:04:27.940> get<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.180> know<00:04:28.270> your<00:04:28.390> number<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.930> get<00:04:29.140> to

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
you get to know your number you get to

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.050 
you get to know your number you get to
know<00:04:29.380> your<00:04:29.530> number<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.310> it's<00:04:30.580> like<00:04:30.820> you

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
know your number and that it's like you

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.790 
know your number and that it's like you
know<00:04:31.150> shopping<00:04:31.480> for<00:04:31.750> clothes<00:04:31.930> or<00:04:32.080> shoes<00:04:32.200> you

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
know shopping for clothes or shoes you

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
know shopping for clothes or shoes you
want<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.040> make<00:04:33.130> sure<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.340> your<00:04:33.669> natural

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
want to make sure that your natural

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.450

nails are clean of any oils or anything

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.909 
nails are clean of any oils or anything
so<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.150> doesn't<00:04:37.390> prohibit<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.740> glue

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
so that it doesn't prohibit the glue

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.920 
so that it doesn't prohibit the glue
from<00:04:39.190> sticking<00:04:39.640> properly<00:04:40.210> because<00:04:40.450> we<00:04:40.750> want

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
from sticking properly because we want

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.480 
from sticking properly because we want
to<00:04:41.020> make<00:04:41.140> sure<00:04:41.169> that<00:04:41.350> they<00:04:41.620> stay<00:04:41.680> on<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.400> they

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
to make sure that they stay on and they

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.370 
to make sure that they stay on and they
don't<00:04:42.669> come<00:04:42.940> off<00:04:43.150> at<00:04:43.330> an<00:04:43.450> inopportune<00:04:43.720> time

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
don't come off at an inopportune time

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.950 
don't come off at an inopportune time
like<00:04:45.070> those<00:04:45.250> old<00:04:45.490> press-on<00:04:46.150> nails<00:04:46.390> used<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.810> do
