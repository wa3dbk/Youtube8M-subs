 android enske today is a happy day to 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.320
 this is a new version of insert coin 300 which 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.900
 already based on the official update from 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.270
 official cs6 for our phone and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.300
 This means that the firmware will be still 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.480
 more stable and many glitches are possible or 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.430
 minor issues will already be eliminated 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.800
 The review will not be very big as on 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.840
 In fact, the update is not so much 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.879
 now let's talk as usual 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.229
 that has changed with the new version 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.059
 ncap coin 300 firmware is naturally the most 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.190
 The main update in this version is 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.330
 that the firmware is based on the latest 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.850
 Version 5 11400 110 the official center 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.400
 for our phone htc ivan 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.680
 because of this update to developers 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.170
 the new version had to bring all of its 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.170
 mods also firmware optimized with 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.790
 all the latest sdk by the way blink feed 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.840
 has already been updated to the very last 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.130
 versions from google play market 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.440
 developers have also updated the service 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.060
 google framework and updated all your 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.550
 churches and applications 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.350
 These were the most important updates. 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.450
 firmware and now we'll talk 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.370
 separately about the updates to the insert 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.350
 incontrol 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.310
 the icon has been fixed here 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.500
 switch nfc 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 also developers added when certain 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.700
 control function of manual change dipia 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.770
 280 to 480 by default 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.689
 strange but I don't seem to work 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.710
 wants normal and to this we are still with you 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.509
 a low memory feature has also been added. 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.060
 killer which, as I understand, frees 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.189
 clogged memory from applications can 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.369
 set the recommended settings or 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.740
 default as it was before it was 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.039
 major changes to the insert in utility 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.929
 control and the final part of the changes 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.210
 firmware will be the innovation of the new 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.369
 standard insert firmware application 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 coin market 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.439
 the application was done work so 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.450
 Now 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.039
 errors are all fixed and it was also 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 improved performance itself 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.690
 The application also has a new section. 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.470
 allowing the installation to be 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.030
 animations without installation through recovery and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.010
 the latest innovation is that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.769
 now you can install all mods 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.319
 straight from the web market itself to the phone 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.390
 go to the market can be on the link brand. 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.230
 insert point by terror. 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.260
 orc and now as usual let's go straight away 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.540
 to desktop of popular firmware 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.930
 the very first with the official senso came out 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.709
 android revolution hd 70.0 and now 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.600
 and insert coin updated as I said in 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.530
 past all android firmware review 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.049
 revolution hd 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.660
 that no change in new or rather 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.180
 official celsius absolutely no all 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.519
 just like we had here at work 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.340
 the table stands a picture of a circus coin and more 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.680
 there is already nothing there is a menu just everything 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.160
 I did not need the necessary applications 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.989
 even when installing one only understand 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.790
 I can not just versions and in all 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.829
 previous versions of the developers then 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.470
 leaves your application grid 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.500
 incontrol and insert kaymar market then 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.660
 again remove them settings so in this 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.849
 versions if the past they were on the menu then in 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.739
 this version is not removed again from the menu and 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.400
 You can go to the utilities from yourself 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.980
 settings 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.900
 so here I don't have anything anymore 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.250
 show anyone interested in tradition already 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.579
 I will open the antutu test 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.090
 my phone scored a terrible rating of 26 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:41.680
 thousand six hundred sixty six points 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.810
 and we are already moving the phone settings right away 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.379
 Consider the innovation wind and can't 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.140
 control 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:51.280
 go here and immediately go to the last 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.090
 tab different here we see the value 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.269
 for dipiai 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.280
 the default screen is 480 but 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.319
 as the menu developers wrote you can 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.629
 install from 200 80 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.760
 However, I just drag 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:08.799
 the slider and value does not change 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.160
 write in the comments how it is 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.140
 do you have another update here this 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.810
 lol memory killer view 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.470
 where the shiver kills as I understand the application 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.180
 with a lack of memory here with this all and 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.180
 now move on to the wizard coin market 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.290
 here there is a boot animation section 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.420
 go here and here granted 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.310
 only three animations are dark 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.440
 classic and at the very bottom already 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.450
 standard in case you are allowed 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.330
 for want to restore as animation by 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.800
 default on this all and at the very end 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.620
 go to the section on the phone as you see 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.780
 I had a version 3.0.0 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.940
