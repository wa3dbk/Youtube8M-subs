00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.079
 there are 600 and 38 new locomotives for commuters ordered by trenitalia 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.810
 Leonardo Bombardier went to see where and how they are born 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.669
 the network and the theater of a new type of cold war by the great gods of the world yes 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.830
 they beat for the control of information and systems 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.180
 communication 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 a new cloning technique in 4 years will bring back much weapon 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 Harmful project scientists are working 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 of the Kyoto University of Japan 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.070
 hello well found in leonardo are many Italians who work for it 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.850
 study every day look for and choose public transport on the iron to 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.800
 move 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.100
 the censis e 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 the estimate is over 14 million commuters 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.570
 and that they are constantly increasing for them was a very hard winter to face 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.060
 of crowded and continuously delayed dirty trains have increased costs 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.940
 tickets and there were sizes to the two-roomed fracts but soon 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.460
 new trenitalia brand new locomotives will arrive, you will order 600 and 38 and us 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 we went to see where they are born 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.850
 he is for you 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.290
 I did the installation 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 nono preferred to talk about the high forest the door of the yellow faithful of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 usually what are the matches you have to do 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.460
 the road to the party festival party 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.990
 usually they can be or report but photo album via rate 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.670
 the perfect imperial 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.799
 i do not track is the locomotives shower 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.530
 the head lasts 40 minutes and is more intense than that required by the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.259
 European regulations for greater security we are in the establishments of Ligurian vado 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.790
 of bombers where milk is produced 4 and 4 trenitalia and ordered 600 38 for the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.779
 regional commuter traffic 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.769
 eighty tons of yours can be born up to 2000 usually stick 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.609
 four carriages the lives of so many people in Italy will be transported by these 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.439
 cars 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.349
 here locomotives are made since 1905, the electric first came from badoo 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.480
 at the time it was laugue steinhaus now for 10 years the Canadian transport giant 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:36.359
 from planes the most famous singer to the three mia in metro bombardier that 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.129
 establishments all over the world 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.669
 600 people work in Liguria at certain times on 20 locomotives a year 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:48.689
 but how to know trenitalia but it is also produced for the competition for abroad has 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:55.120
 made by 20 art 140 locomotives per year changing production system there 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.589
 we are put on the street to begin the fruits of the past the whole must have them 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.099
 seriously locomotives to minimize times 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.099
 to date the pomatina of sea establishment 12 days 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.739
 since when they start working on it when we finish then we have 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.249
 organized for 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.510
 for work points, tat recall is made in each workplace 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:18.479
 single activity so for example all the mystical match end 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.479
 together some other part studies all the electrical part 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.589
 eas which work that operates software 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:29.569
 on that post it is free to work chemistry if it is enough that 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.169
 - giving time and as objective and then moving the profane locomotive 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.540
 from one side of the vote to the other, the second processing then 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:42.260
 it is also possible to see the path of the automotive that makes and enters 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.179
 growth that it does before being finalized 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.969
 here is one of these containers on the balance scale scale feels 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.790
 which decreases weight understands 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.240
 that pieces are missing 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.599
 and then sends a signal to valentina and to the supplier 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.419
 even small details so help the production impossible to show everything 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.170
 the process the documents say 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.120
 because the e 4 and 4 is made of 90,000 427 party incorporates twenty one 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.640
 kilometers of cables and the first locomotive with a lot of electronics board the materials 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.470
 and all subsystems are tested for a long time before assembly to reduce them 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.900
 bad surprises after the electrical tests and on regional transport machines 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.270
 they last 11 days for goods transport 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.990
 the locomotive ice from here also with a system that is called orbits the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.650
 so-called predictive diagnostics keeps every train parameter under control 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.350
 in circulation signal critical points where to intervene before it is a 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.550
 problem or parts that need maintenance 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.939
 commuters can't wait for Trenitalia to use it all the time 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.189
 defense of sensitive data protection of networks economic interests and there is a 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.550
 new type of cold war going on in the world 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.910
 that sees old and new great powers as protagonists and to fight the 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:10.900
 better in the seasons
