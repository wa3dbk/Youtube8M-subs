the<00:02:53.840> self<00:02:54.080> through<00:02:54.410> inner<00:02:54.770> reliance<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.770> that

the self through inner reliance and that

the self through inner reliance and that
Wiseman<00:02:58.510> can't<00:02:59.510> pass<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.810> on<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.400> he<00:03:01.580> goes<00:03:01.760> on

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
Wiseman can't pass it on so he goes on

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.990 
Wiseman can't pass it on so he goes on
and<00:03:02.450> tries<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.980> figure<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.130> out<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.610> his<00:03:04.790> own

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000

and tries to figure this out on his own
I<00:03:05.270> don't<00:03:05.540> want<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.840> give<00:03:05.960> you<00:03:06.050> any<00:03:06.170> more<00:03:06.440> about

in place to read it yourself what I can

in place to read it yourself what I can
say<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:12.020> I<00:03:12.050> was<00:03:12.790> pleasantly<00:03:14.770> occupied

for<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.220> week<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:17.270> started<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> week<00:03:18.050> much

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
for a week and I started the week much

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.170 
for a week and I started the week much
more<00:03:18.620> excited<00:03:19.190> about<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.520> book<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:19.910> as<00:03:20.030> the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
more excited about the book and as the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.850 
more excited about the book and as the
book<00:03:20.330> when<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.540> had<00:03:20.810> my<00:03:20.990> second<00:03:21.380> sort<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.710> weaned

off<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.640> completed<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.800> was<00:03:25.790> happy

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
off and and I completed it and was happy

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.340 
off and and I completed it and was happy
with<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:27.430> what<00:03:28.430> got<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.850> me<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.840> what<00:03:30.020> gets<00:03:30.200> to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
with it what got to me and what gets to

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.120 
with it what got to me and what gets to
me<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.500> lot<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.860> this<00:03:31.040> type<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.430> stuff<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:33.130> much

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
me a lot with this type of stuff is much

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.360 
me a lot with this type of stuff is much
like<00:03:34.370> Siddhartha<00:03:34.940> discovered<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:36.560> this

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
like Siddhartha discovered that this

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.370 
like Siddhartha discovered that this
type<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.670> wisdom<00:03:38.150> can't<00:03:38.420> be<00:03:38.540> passed<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.110> few

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
type of wisdom can't be passed on a few

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.470 
type of wisdom can't be passed on a few
words<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:42.290> kind<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.070> seems<00:03:43.400> almost<00:03:43.820> redundant

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
words it kind of seems almost redundant

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.270 
words it kind of seems almost redundant
that<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.470> author<00:03:45.800> has<00:03:46.040> he<00:03:46.550> tries<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:48.280> prove

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
that the author has he tries to prove

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.890 
that the author has he tries to prove
this<00:03:49.580> through<00:03:50.060> words<00:03:50.480> through<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.500> book<00:03:51.770> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
this through words through the book and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.540 
this through words through the book and
it's<00:03:53.900> it's<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.590> how<00:03:54.710> I've<00:03:54.980> run<00:03:55.220> into<00:03:55.400> him

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
it's it's of how I've run into him

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.750 
it's it's of how I've run into him
before<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:57.050> know<00:03:57.110> I've<00:03:57.590> read<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.250> lot<00:03:58.460> of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
before you know I've read a lot of

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.040 
before you know I've read a lot of
philosophy<00:04:00.070> dealing<00:04:01.070> with<00:04:01.250> one<00:04:01.700> nature<00:04:02.420> and

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
philosophy dealing with one nature and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.480 
philosophy dealing with one nature and
you<00:04:03.950> know<00:04:04.070> all<00:04:04.580> that<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.390> know<00:04:06.460> call<00:04:07.460> it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
you know all that you know call it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.990 
you know all that you know call it
eccentric<00:04:08.300> or<00:04:08.510> whatever<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.440> want<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.760> kind

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
eccentric or whatever you want that kind

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.530 
eccentric or whatever you want that kind
of<00:04:11.150> stuff<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:12.140> fault<00:04:12.740> that<00:04:12.830> I've<00:04:13.010> always

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
of stuff and the fault that I've always

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.650 
of stuff and the fault that I've always
found<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.609> don't<00:04:16.910> believe<00:04:17.180> this<00:04:17.390> type

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
found is that I don't believe this type

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.320 
found is that I don't believe this type
of<00:04:17.690> stuff<00:04:18.080> can<00:04:18.380> be<00:04:18.410> discovered<00:04:19.070> through<00:04:19.430> words

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
of stuff can be discovered through words

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.150 
of stuff can be discovered through words
into

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
into

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.380 
into
books<00:04:21.550> just<00:04:22.390> like<00:04:22.480> Siddhartha<00:04:23.170> and<00:04:24.390> so

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
books just like Siddhartha and so

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.480 
books just like Siddhartha and so
therefore<00:04:26.230> I<00:04:26.260> think<00:04:26.530> there's<00:04:26.920> almost<00:04:27.100> always

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
therefore I think there's almost always

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.970 
therefore I think there's almost always
an<00:04:27.940> inherent<00:04:28.380> disappointment<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.770> these

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
an inherent disappointment in these

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.770 
an inherent disappointment in these
types<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.370> books<00:04:30.640> even<00:04:30.880> if<00:04:31.120> they<00:04:31.270> they<00:04:31.660> might

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
types of books even if they they might

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.740 
types of books even if they they might
open<00:04:32.080> your<00:04:32.410> eyes<00:04:32.620> wide<00:04:33.040> -<00:04:33.670> brand<00:04:33.940> new<00:04:34.060> concepts

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
open your eyes wide - brand new concepts

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.350 
open your eyes wide - brand new concepts
that<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.110> have<00:04:35.260> never<00:04:35.620> even<00:04:36.100> conceived<00:04:37.090> of

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
that you have never even conceived of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.820 
that you have never even conceived of
before<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.990> think<00:04:38.050> that's<00:04:38.260> wonderful<00:04:38.590> and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
before and I think that's wonderful and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.350 
before and I think that's wonderful and
that's<00:04:38.950> great<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.460> think<00:04:39.520> they<00:04:39.730> certainly<00:04:39.940> help

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
that's great I think they certainly help

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.310 
that's great I think they certainly help
you<00:04:40.510> get<00:04:40.750> your<00:04:40.900> foot<00:04:41.340> on<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.670> right<00:04:42.790> track

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
you get your foot on the right track

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.980 
you get your foot on the right track
going<00:04:44.320> down<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.680> right<00:04:44.830> path<00:04:45.660> but<00:04:46.660> they<00:04:46.780> can

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
going down the right path but they can

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.350 
going down the right path but they can
never<00:04:47.170> provide<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.800> answers<00:04:48.490> no<00:04:48.940> matter<00:04:49.210> how

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
never provide the answers no matter how

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.450 
never provide the answers no matter how
much<00:04:49.570> they<00:04:49.810> may<00:04:50.260> want<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:52.350> I<00:04:53.350> also<00:04:53.950> find<00:04:54.310> it

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
much they may want to and I also find it

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.340 
much they may want to and I also find it
a<00:04:54.550> little<00:04:54.670> odd<00:04:54.940> when<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:56.170> man<00:04:56.530> writes<00:04:56.950> about<00:04:57.310> a

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
a little odd when a man writes about a

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.390 
a little odd when a man writes about a
fictional<00:04:59.350> character<00:04:59.590> finding

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
fictional character finding

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.390 
fictional character finding
enlightenment<00:05:01.090> because<00:05:01.780> odds<00:05:02.650> are<00:05:02.950> the

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
enlightenment because odds are the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.760 
enlightenment because odds are the
author<00:05:03.610> himself<00:05:04.200> has<00:05:05.200> never<00:05:05.470> found

author himself has never found

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.770 
author himself has never found
enlightenment<00:05:06.190> or<00:05:06.640> he<00:05:06.910> probably<00:05:07.210> wouldn't<00:05:07.690> be

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
enlightenment or he probably wouldn't be

enlightenment or he probably wouldn't be

spending his time writing fiction but

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.840 
spending his time writing fiction but
instead<00:05:11.380> spending<00:05:12.370> his<00:05:12.490> time

instead spending his time

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.140 
instead spending his time
like<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:14.260> Buddha<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.400> present<00:05:15.850> in<00:05:16.000> this

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
what I mean by that so overall I I

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.060 
what I mean by that so overall I I
probably<00:05:22.630> give<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.170> book<00:05:23.380> around<00:05:23.650> like<00:05:23.950> a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
probably give this book around like a

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.790 
probably give this book around like a
seven<00:05:24.460> out<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.580> ten<00:05:24.730> I<00:05:24.910> enjoy<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:26.470> could

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
seven out of ten I enjoy it I I could

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.200 
seven out of ten I enjoy it I I could
see<00:05:26.950> myself<00:05:27.130> reading<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.730> again<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.150> would

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
see myself reading it again and I would

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.640 
see myself reading it again and I would
definitely<00:05:28.600> recommend<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:29.170> to<00:05:29.290> anybody<00:05:29.470> that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
definitely recommend it to anybody that

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.120 
definitely recommend it to anybody that
has<00:05:29.830> even<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.280> little<00:05:30.490> interest<00:05:30.850> in<00:05:31.110> Eastern

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
has even a little interest in Eastern

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.420 
has even a little interest in Eastern
religious<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.400> scientific<00:05:34.260> philosophy

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
religious and scientific philosophy

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.920 
religious and scientific philosophy
maybe<00:05:36.430> Scientifics<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.270> wrong<00:05:37.419> term<00:05:37.690> but<00:05:37.900> you

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
maybe Scientifics the wrong term but you

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.270 
maybe Scientifics the wrong term but you
know<00:05:38.020> what<00:05:38.169> I<00:05:38.290> mean<00:05:39.840> but<00:05:40.840> it's<00:05:40.960> just<00:05:41.050> what<00:05:41.280> you

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
know what I mean but it's just what you

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.630 
know what I mean but it's just what you
know<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:43.260> just<00:05:44.550> kind<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.760> wish<00:05:46.000> that<00:05:47.460> maybe<00:05:48.460> it

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
know I just kind of wish that maybe it

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.860 
know I just kind of wish that maybe it
could<00:05:48.669> have<00:05:48.850> pushed<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.419> boundaries<00:05:49.750> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
could have pushed the boundaries a

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.360 
could have pushed the boundaries a
little<00:05:50.110> bit<00:05:50.350> farther<00:05:50.650> maybe<00:05:50.950> could<00:05:51.280> have

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
little bit farther maybe could have

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.150 
little bit farther maybe could have
opened<00:05:51.550> my<00:05:51.790> mind<00:05:52.060> up<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.510> few<00:05:52.900> new<00:05:53.200> concepts

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
opened my mind up to a few new concepts

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.250 
opened my mind up to a few new concepts
that<00:05:54.340> I<00:05:54.430> hadn't<00:05:54.790> really<00:05:55.090> read<00:05:55.690> before<00:05:55.900> but

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260

admitting to such things I realized that

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:42.139 
admitting to such things I realized that
I'm<00:06:40.229> not<00:06:40.379> nearly<00:06:40.739> as<00:06:40.979> well-rounded<00:06:41.189> as<00:06:41.519> I<00:06:41.699> as<00:06:41.999> I
