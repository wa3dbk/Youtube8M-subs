00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
in the back of the net so although you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.710 
in the back of the net so although you
haven't<00:01:20.460> been<00:01:20.640> great<00:01:20.970> you've<00:01:21.299> still<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
haven't been great you've still got the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
haven't been great you've still got the
potential<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> hurt<00:01:22.530> teams<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.430> very

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
potential to hurt teams and it's very

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
potential to hurt teams and it's very
much<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.850> smash-and-grab<00:01:24.570> first<00:01:25.140> 15<00:01:25.530> 20

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
much a smash-and-grab first 15 20

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
much a smash-and-grab first 15 20
minutes<00:01:26.100> they've<00:01:26.310> always<00:01:26.460> dangerous<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
minutes they've always dangerous and I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.779 
minutes they've always dangerous and I
thought<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> penalty<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.610> obviously

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
thought the penalty that they obviously

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.149 
thought the penalty that they obviously
equalized<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> 40th

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
equalized with you know and the 40th

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.750 
equalized with you know and the 40th
minute<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.840> Miss<00:01:33.840> dubious

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:49.470 

I<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.160> was<00:01:48.250> harsh<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.820> was<00:01:48.940> soft<00:01:49.210> but<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
I think it was harsh it was soft but the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.850 
I think it was harsh it was soft but the
other<00:01:49.630> bench<00:01:49.870> will<00:01:50.050> obviously<00:01:50.230> feel<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.710> was

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
other bench will obviously feel it was

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.480 
other bench will obviously feel it was
worthy<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:53.170> go<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.470> 11<00:01:53.860> i<00:01:53.950> said<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.280> boys

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
worthy so to go in 11 i said to the boys

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.250 
worthy so to go in 11 i said to the boys
we<00:01:54.700> didn't<00:01:54.910> deserve<00:01:55.180> no<00:01:55.360> more<00:01:55.570> than<00:01:55.720> 11<00:01:56.020> after

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
we didn't deserve no more than 11 after

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.710 
we didn't deserve no more than 11 after
i<00:01:56.710> honestly<00:01:57.190> didn't<00:01:57.520> feel<00:01:57.730> that<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.450> know<00:01:58.570> we

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
i honestly didn't feel that you know we

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.900 
i honestly didn't feel that you know we
want<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.110> being<00:01:59.320> any<00:01:59.470> further<00:01:59.740> than<00:01:59.980> than

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
which is protected our lead I don't

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.140
