00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.590
 welcome back to one 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.050
 new edition of the small building block 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.509
 eureka on klemmer stern.de and also on 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.400
 1000 stones de-mail damascus I put 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.289
 Regularly I heart for lego forums 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.869
 we already announced we are working 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.779
 us through the occupancy movie set through 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.310
 and are now at 7 0 8 0 1 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.519
 arrived what on the beautiful 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.900
 romantic names become the space below 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.840
 We'll just pick it up here 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 the pack and we are like 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.060
 said in the world of movements like 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.540
 the film will be released in april 2004 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.200
 the words of us i mentioned it and it 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.960
 is that we the good endgames 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.700
 which is nothing but a normal one 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.160
 resident and suddenly somehow 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.950
 is pulled in somewhere and you think 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.770
 he is the messiah and he must now 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 the piece of resistance probably somehow 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.670
 Protect further bring what I know 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.130
 and a probably very unsympathetic gentleman 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 with name business who has tried the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.520
 to take over world domination and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.770
 even the fantasy to take us away 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 because something against as lego fans and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.060
 That's why we have to defend ourselves 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.899
 and we already see this little one 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.039
 set for 14 99 are not just 122 parts 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.890
 inside but also three mini figures 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.630
 among other things the ms and the is 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.149
 pretty much not to say exactly 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.979
 the same as in the set I do 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.619
 namely last week have discussed 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.999
 the flight with the skid also that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.460
 scared face is back 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.740
 and this beautiful great with this 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.819
 small hairline up there notice 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.679
 if you are from above again 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.429
 looks and red behind as I said 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.380
 that's the piece of resistance yes that 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.420
 is the evil in this set namely the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.579
 spot robot 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.450
 You can see that he is a policeman 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.520
 that's why swat ssw at and he has one 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.829
 robot face and only 1 otherwise 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.450
 well decorated with appropriate brands 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.750
 and even there is a radio in the back 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 elegant as it were entered with 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 otherwise head has nothing else than 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.950
 just in the robot head and a weapon in 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.260
 the hand it must be as bad for it 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.830
 the highlight as far as the characters are concerned 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.420
 this set 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.330
 that's that here, respectively 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.820
 this lady this namely wild style is 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.160
 she is each written with y sees 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.410
 They also made nice in black 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.790
 he so ninja look you have to say and you 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.470
 has an ax in hand 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.940
 with that she wants the emmett in 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 Here we come free this set 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 equal to what also nice first 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 she has a nice face and she has 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.920
 a pretty flexible hat we there 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.959
 just had my hand 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.860
 you have to look very closely that 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.390
 the faces are really 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.100
 they make a difference with ease 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.470
 my behind a bit dogged 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.320
 in front a bit more friendly 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.520
 yes, and so it is hipster just that 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.080
 we do not do it now but like that 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.900
 is that part of it and then we have too 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.980
 nice hooded pullover pulled so pure 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.470
 as we may perhaps from the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.209
 already know trailer from the film and that 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.330
 here, yes, that's the melting pot 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.000
 or that is our good mister 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.760
 reader looks a bit like out 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 including a james bond movie 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.970
 switchboard what we have here with two 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.549
 scarce a few and show up here 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.170
 this is the laser and you can 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.049
 it almost suspect in this construct 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.600
 not only good in the sense of not being too 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.730
 say he wants our ans ans 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.070
 leather or in this case to the piece 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.600
 the resistance on the back has that 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.830
 we'll see you soon like that 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.019
 laser is also with a corresponding one 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.320
 hose connected and on the other 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.570
 page 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.890
 there one never knows where else with the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.310
 handcuffs we all know about 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.959
 home 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.450
 there we have what there is a possibility 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.760
 there we can click one of them because left and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.410
 because there comes delinquent on it 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.380
 so in this case speak our image 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.510
 he has to be tormented as he is 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.519
 then even so, make it possible 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.950
 to bind and then the laser 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.600
 to all compose accordingly 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.310
 must be around the good piece of 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.739
 we can remove it, too 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.290
 everything moves back and forth cliffs 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.019
 and also move the laser back and forth 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.519
 so now take the ms and the 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.019
 Let's do it with a face 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.570
 it is part of it below 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.160
 this set here in his chair 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.890
 there was the piece of resistance threatening 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.880
 this red behind and there must now 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.320
 fumble a bit 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.660
 but we can do that 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.480
 already find end to the back and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.190
 then please do not scream now but 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.670
 Just let it go and times 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.400
 here 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.660
 the chains to the hand what you ask 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.240
 with hold on 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.300
 that brings a little bit to everyone 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.460
 more fun and then with the laser run the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.400
 Let's click there now and we'll see 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.100
 so may be in spite of james bond as well 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.210
 At least as far as you can dream 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.010
 Do not sit here on this chair 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.540
 and we saw the laser in the back 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.640
 here too, little lights everywhere 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.900
 thus indicated lamps we can 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.350
 we can do everything we can 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.850
 move and so if you want 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.830
 you can do it a bit 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.210
 flexible to show the whole and if it is 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.890
 we should still be able to turn around 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.450
 we can already see the smiles here 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.970
 we can get away too much 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.610
 Of course, and we'll see it now 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.900
 right here for now 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.190
 strapped and then he wants 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.600
 of course, his scared 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.640
 otherwise he does not have a face 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.470
 fun here with the laser has been there 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.760
 he him and now we can do very well 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.200
 piece so then the piece of 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.410
 Resistance ran 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.510
 yes yes yes here we are also tormenting 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.310
 and the good is yes we have the yes 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.090
 Wildstyle and she wants us with the yes 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.770
 to liberate the ax 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.410
 the skin then passes through the canton 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.330
 the story here then we see how 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.840
 the whole thing is built on the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.700
 set course parts 122 said yes already 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.980
 she has 20 minutes in the quarter hour 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.380
 minutes together and already can 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.350
 the great fun with the reader machine 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:52.680
 and strapped to the ad then go off 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.060
 that's why there's a nice little set 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.500
 I must confess the skid I found now 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.420
 actually a little nicer the 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.750
 I had a few more interesting ones 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.330
 this is growing here so then it is like that 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.070
 not so especially wildstyle because so 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.410
 the minifigures I find the more on 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.300
 nicest and so on readers 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.040
 games and such stories 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.180
 of course that can be done on this set then 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.710
 also have his pleasure 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.930
 that was it for today with the 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.150
 terminal building block lyric and at 1000 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.130
 stones dw we will be in a few 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.290
 see and hear again and which days 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.770
 then it will be the yes that will not 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.390
 betray 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.390
 look in and bye
