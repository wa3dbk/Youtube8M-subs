00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Yep, sorry Thierry, stop please!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.500
Oi! Off-screen voice stop please.
&lt;i&gt;[ok oh!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's boring!... Landscape makes everybody yawn!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
I mean, even Roger's getting bored!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.500
Stop it!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.500
&lt;i&gt;[I mean, this is what the film production asked for.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.000
No, a Neopulsar's production does not look like this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
A Neopulsar's production should be...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.900
No?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
&lt;i&gt;[I know, but we tried to create a more poetic...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I see, but the emphasis on the landscape with the...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Enough! Enough!

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
&lt;i&gt;[Great shot! That must have hurt.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Why such a tragic ending...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in a funny movie?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
&lt;i&gt;[Though, at the same time, Thierry, he wasn't wrong...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
&lt;i&gt;[Hmm, right, start tape 22, the action one!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.800
&lt;i&gt;[Nice mug!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You asked for action?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
&lt;i&gt;[Absolutely!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.500
&lt;i&gt;[Such suppleness!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.800
Stunning! Don't you think?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
&lt;i&gt;[Pretty good indeed.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.500
&lt;i&gt;[Impressive.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
Is this not action?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Protractor muscles...

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.000
&lt;i&gt;[Quick! Let's find an opponent.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
&lt;i&gt;[Come back, please.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
&lt;i&gt;[Not a Council worker]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.500
&lt;i&gt;[Besides he has glasses.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
&lt;i&gt;[We got him.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
&lt;i&gt;[The Indians ...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.500
&lt;i&gt;[...well known.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's scratching...

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500
No...not the guitar,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.500
the helmet!

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500
&lt;i&gt;[The joke's average...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.000
Listen to me McKranck,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.300
It doesn't matter that your helmet is scratching you!

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.000
It is not an excuse!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.500
The ongoing problem...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.800
is the frame!

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.500
By the way,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
there's a real perspective issue there.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500
&lt;i&gt;[He's not wrong.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.000
You're right, it's a big issue!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
&lt;i&gt;[It's going to be bloody!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.500
By the way, wouldn't it be better with the screen bars?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.700
Like in the movies?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Mind out!

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.000
&lt;i&gt;[You prefer it this way?]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.700
&lt;i&gt;[Higher?]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.500
No, lower!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Perfect, stop! Stop!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.500
&lt;i&gt;[He can lunge, you see.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500
&lt;i&gt;[He's started!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
&lt;i&gt;[He's bolted!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500
&lt;i&gt;[He's not kidding.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
&lt;i&gt;[Pathetic]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500
&lt;i&gt;[Absolutely]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
&lt;i&gt;[Looks like a B-movie...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.000
&lt;i&gt;[At least, his technique's good!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
&lt;i&gt;[Whoa, the guy's tumbling...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
&lt;i&gt;[Impressive.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.000
&lt;i&gt;[Look at that high kick!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
&lt;i&gt;[Still has an amazing suppleness.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
&lt;i&gt;[Frankly, I think he's dodging it very well!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.000
&lt;i&gt;[No! He's kicking now!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500
TIME OUT

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500
&lt;i&gt;[Essential]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500
&lt;i&gt;[Well, ok... a coffee please!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.400
Hello?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.700
Stevie?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Hey Bob, what's up?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.500
No, you're not disturbing me!

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.000
Actually I'm shooting a movie.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.800
Tell me, what's that noise?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Oh, nothing, the off-screen voice just threw up?!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This movie seems like a bloody mess!

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.000
Well, I better go Bob, bye!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
What?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.500
Stevie?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.500
ACTUALLY IT ALL GOES WELL IN THE END

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.000
&lt;i&gt;[He knows De Niro!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.800
&lt;i&gt;[Apparently...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.000
&lt;i&gt;[They succeded in having De Niro]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
&lt;i&gt;[They succeded in having Robert]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
&lt;i&gt;[Huge!]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.500
&lt;i&gt;[Can't you see there's ice on the road?]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500
&lt;i&gt;[Yeap, so there is...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500
&lt;i&gt;[I knew it.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.000
&lt;i&gt;[We put salt down though.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.500
BUT THE MOVIE DOESN'T COME TOGETHER VERY WELL

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500
&lt;i&gt;[They're not wrong.]&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
IT'S A LITTLE LONG

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.300
Shot in the Jura...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.500
...entirely in a film studio

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.000
AND THE LAST WORD SHALL GO TO BOB...

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500
...THANX BOB.
