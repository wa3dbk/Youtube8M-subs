00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
enough room and I thought that I might

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.810 
enough room and I thought that I might
like<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:26.279> get<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.640> LTE<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.820> once

reflection does look really HD i mean

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340

you<00:01:14.970> could<00:01:15.119> tell<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.720> huge<00:01:16.080> difference

from the ipad to be able to see it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
from the ipad to be able to see it
probably<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:18.950> your<00:01:19.950> computer<00:01:20.400> isn't<00:01:20.820> as

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
probably because your computer isn't as

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.870 
probably because your computer isn't as
good<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.100> says<00:01:23.280> ipad

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
not really surprised with how good this

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.420 
not really surprised with how good this
is<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.250> apparently<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> five<00:01:42.930> megapixel

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
is so apparently as a five megapixel

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.609 
is so apparently as a five megapixel
camera<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> I'll<00:01:45.030> use<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.140> 1080p

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
camera and I'll use that and the 1080p

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
camera and I'll use that and the 1080p
recording<00:01:46.860> I'll<00:01:47.430> probably<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.030> instead

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
recording I'll probably use this instead

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.780 
recording I'll probably use this instead
of<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> video<00:01:48.750> camera<00:01:49.140> sometimes<00:01:49.619> okay<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.340> high

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
of a video camera sometimes okay so high

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.630
