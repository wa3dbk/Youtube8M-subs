00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.809
 well that must be one of the elements of 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.660
 basis of the civilizing function of 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:19.840
 parents with their children that because 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.220
 finally in a siblings a child the 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.890
 question of whether one can be 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.090
 equitable with him never arises 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.779
 but from the moment a second child 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.730
 who is coming 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.060
 then a third and eventually 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.220
 still others at that time a 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.330
 question to ask 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.940
 well before parents die 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.170
 masters on their will bequeathed 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.120
 in a fair way to our children our 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.570
 goods and isli will share in a way 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.719
 just in all the childhood of this 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 siblings there is going to be daily life 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.430
 who will come to weigh all his weight on 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.829
 the way parents can get 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.199
 unravel with this problem and we see 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.789
 although at that moment it poses a 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:07.660
 question which is twofold on the one hand 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:11.500
 can we love his children 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.580
 the same way and secondly is this 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.570
 that being fair only deals with 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.150
 the emotional investment of children or 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.950
 on the contrary on other things 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.950
 to the first question is what can 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.150
 love her children alike unlike 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.170
 what many parents say I 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.200
 love you all the same 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.329
 I think that's not the case at all 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 think kids are loved from a 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.509
 different way 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.520
 it's not about whether it's more - 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.710
 only but they are loved of a 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.869
 different way because they come to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.689
 different moments in the lives of 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.159
 families obviously we can see that the 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.299
 investments by children 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.880
 parents are quite often specific 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.680
 and very often very variable between 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.420
 children 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.000
 but after the question of equitability 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.030
 in the same family it's when I 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.630
 give cake to my first 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.850
 child 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.259
 it takes that cake share for the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 second is pretty much the same 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.740
 dimension 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.630
 because otherwise we can see that the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.580
 children are they with their feet to 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.140
 slide and their masters in the process of 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 measure 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.120
 the size of the cake in question so 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.440
 what does that mean 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.090
 it comes to say that children are at 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 looking for something that would be 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.830
 a fair position of their parents with 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.250
 them and that 600 to this search for the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.550
 justice between children is because 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.370
 that a priori they have the impression that it 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 is not exactly the case then that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.540
 comes from something that has been very 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.390
 studied by psychoanalysts as 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.489
 melanie klein which is the question of 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.330
 fraternal rivalry in a family 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.739
 when a baby will be born is the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.650
 big brother or big sister who 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.620
 expecting a baby is prayed by his parents 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.480
 to say that he is very very happy with 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.300
 see the arrival of his little brother or his 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.090
 little sister and that's it very often 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.670
 that we can not imagine how much 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.590
 the eldest child is caught in a 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.440
 situation often there that is very very 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.570
 ambiguous for him he does that to say 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.730
 to please his parents yes I 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.380
 am very happy mom and dad to have 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.000
 a little brother or a little sister and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.280
 fondly caress the friday it's me 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.850
 missed that grows as and when 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.799
 the pregnancy 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.959
 but at the same time inside him 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.489
 consciously or unconsciously there is the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.470
 does that all of a sudden he will lose his 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.110
 place two single or two son 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.329
 unique and that in doing so he will have to 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.310
 share his parents with the one who 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.370
 happens so we could say who is 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.269
 inscribed in the very principle of siblings 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.180
 the fact that there is the desire to be everything 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.880
 alone that is counterbalanced by the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.799
 need to share etc obviously the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.470
 question of the equitability of the parents 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.870
 the kids will be confronting this 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.489
 question of how children 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.560
 consider or not the rivalry 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.700
 brotherly 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.769
 we can see that families in 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.590
 which because of the type of 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.410
 transactions that has kids are 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.049
 quite easily entail by the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.190
 family group question shared 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.190
 in a more or less 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.130
 we could say euphoric what they 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.110
 have to share in the family 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.870
 and then who instead has families 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.130
 in which because of the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.640
 transaction that happens in this type of 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.190
 family 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.950
 the notion of cleavage is at the front of the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.620
 scene we can see lines of 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.080
 fracture operate between different 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.660
 members of the siblings in which each 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.880
 children go more or less 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.750
 consciously trained parents has 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.220
 precisely to be unfair and for the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.690
 parents it's very important to be 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.490
 aware of this case there so 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.050
 a little fallen in the panel a way 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.910
 too much power displayed at the same time 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.980
 reserved emotional investment 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.700
 emotional emotion with their children 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.480
 in a way that is different with 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.850
 each of the children 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.160
 we can not love those boys his 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.810
 girls in the same way but at the same 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.730
 time in terms of everyday life 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.060
 maybe just be careful about this 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.680
 that the distribution of materialization 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.390
 concrete of these affective relationships 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.010
 it may be the subject of a 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.200
 national attention not 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.380
 brighten things that will add to it 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.450
 on the side of the fracture line in 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.430
 question so for parents 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.560
 are working on this issue of kits 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.080
 skill is an art of the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.500
 diplomacy to think about between the two 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.750
 parents and in light of this 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.530
 family atmosphere in which this 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.530
 question arises
