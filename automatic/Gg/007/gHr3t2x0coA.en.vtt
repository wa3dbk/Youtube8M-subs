coming<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.110> gap<00:00:38.629> kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> similar

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
coming right up the gap kind of similar

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
coming right up the gap kind of similar
to<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.379> we're<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.730> know

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
to what we're gonna have here you know

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.979 
to what we're gonna have here you know
in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.480> second<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:44.510> not<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.899> hundred

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
in a second or two not one hundred

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319 
in a second or two not one hundred
percent<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.530> same<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:46.920> real<00:00:47.070> close<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
percent the same but real close and you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.369 
percent the same but real close and you
know<00:00:48.420> we'll<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.660> run<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> again<00:00:49.050> something

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
know we'll just run it again something

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
know we'll just run it again something
with<00:00:49.469> nobody<00:00:49.739> blocking<00:00:50.190> i<00:00:50.309> believe<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:50.789> ran

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
with nobody blocking i believe they ran

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
with nobody blocking i believe they ran
it<00:00:51.149> against<00:00:51.360> five<00:00:52.050> wide<00:00:52.289> maybe<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.129> game

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it against five wide maybe in the game

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.270 
it against five wide maybe in the game
but<00:00:54.059> um<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.289> concept<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> have

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
but um the concept here is that you have

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.819 
but um the concept here is that you have
both<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> dt's<00:00:56.940> rush<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> gap<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:58.680> we

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
both the dt's rush in the a gap which we

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.619 
both the dt's rush in the a gap which we
have<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.550> more<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.030> than<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> other<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
have here one more so than the other and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.180 
have here one more so than the other and
then<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> d-ends<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.829> contain

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
then the d-ends will be in contain

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
then the d-ends will be in contain
rushes<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.850> don't<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.120> contain<00:01:03.510> rushes

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
rushes now we don't have contain rushes

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
rushes now we don't have contain rushes
on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> game<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> put<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on the game that we can put them in so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.649 
on the game that we can put them in so
we're<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> use<00:01:06.299> actual

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we're just going to use actual

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.469 
we're just going to use actual
quarterback<00:01:07.110> contains<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.790> safety

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
quarterback contains and then the safety

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
quarterback contains and then the safety
strong<00:01:09.750> safety<00:01:09.810> would<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.260> blitzing<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
strong safety would be blitzing in the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370 
strong safety would be blitzing in the
beat<00:01:10.979> yet<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
beat yet so when you look at this it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
beat yet so when you look at this it
actually<00:01:13.619> looks<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.640> similar<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
actually looks kind of similar to the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.310 
actually looks kind of similar to the
nickel<00:01:16.380> normal<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> gap<00:01:17.180> concept<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:19.229> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
nickel normal a gap concept and as you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
nickel normal a gap concept and as you
can<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.740> dt<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:20.460> mean<00:01:20.610> starts

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
can see the dt right there i mean starts

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.130 
can see the dt right there i mean starts
to<00:01:21.060> come<00:01:21.180> through<00:01:21.390> he<00:01:21.479> does<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.780> picked<00:01:22.020> up

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to come through he does get picked up

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.840 
to come through he does get picked up
i'm<00:01:22.320> using<00:01:22.560> somebody<00:01:22.860> real<00:01:23.130> slow<00:01:23.430> over<00:01:23.729> there

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
i'm using somebody real slow over there

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.320 
i'm using somebody real slow over there
I<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.210> brandon<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.630> bein<00:01:24.920> um<00:01:26.330> starts

I think it's brandon me bein um starts

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.569 
I think it's brandon me bein um starts
to<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.509> picked<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
to get picked up and then you know you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
to get picked up and then you know you
block<00:01:29.820> shuts<00:01:30.060> off<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> mean<00:01:31.740> it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
block shuts off and but it mean it's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.520 
block shuts off and but it mean it's
pretty<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> exact<00:01:32.579> same<00:01:32.759> concept<00:01:33.240> so

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
pretty much the exact same concept so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
pretty much the exact same concept so
kind<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> ironic<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.340> thought<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.880> something

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
kind of ironic i thought it's something

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
kind of ironic i thought it's something
that<00:01:36.299> would<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.509> considered<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.290> taboo<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that would be considered so taboo in the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.740 
that would be considered so taboo in the
sim<00:01:38.280> world<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.390> let's<00:01:39.600> not

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
sim world like this you know let's not

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.620 
sim world like this you know let's not
send<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.229> video<00:01:40.470> game<00:01:40.680> football<00:01:40.950> is

send that's video game football is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.580 
send that's video game football is
actually<00:01:42.630> probably<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> most

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
actually probably one of the most

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.370 
actually probably one of the most
symptoms<00:01:44.450> some<00:01:45.450> things<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.259> in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so kind of a debt issue so basically

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.900 
so kind of a debt issue so basically
what<00:02:10.560> i<00:02:10.590> wanted<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.310> wanted<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> start

you<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.180> looking<00:02:12.480> at<00:02:12.569> other<00:02:12.720> ways<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.379> maybe

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you know looking at other ways to maybe

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.260 
you know looking at other ways to maybe
get<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.130> strong<00:02:14.370> safety<00:02:14.730> coming<00:02:15.000> directly

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
get that strong safety coming directly

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.330 
get that strong safety coming directly
at<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.599> gap<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.650> does<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.069> actual

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
at the be gap like he does in the actual

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.910 
at the be gap like he does in the actual
New<00:02:17.490> England<00:02:17.760> Patriots<00:02:18.120> video<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.830> did

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
New England Patriots video so what I did

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
New England Patriots video so what I did
there<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.370> tried<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.670> bring<00:02:20.849> down<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
there is I tried to bring down the the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.940 
there is I tried to bring down the the
deep<00:02:21.630> safety<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.200> blitz<00:02:22.410> him<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> gap

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
deep safety and blitz him in the gap

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.250 
deep safety and blitz him in the gap
instead<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> as<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.599> can<00:02:24.690> see<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.930> looked

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
instead and as you can see it looked

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.630 
instead and as you can see it looked
like<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> was<00:02:25.680> almost<00:02:25.860> there<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
like it was almost there but then the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.360 
like it was almost there but then the
guy<00:02:26.760> looped<00:02:27.030> around<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.450> got<00:02:27.569> him<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
guy looped around and got him so that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
guy looped around and got him so that
probably<00:02:29.670> isn't<00:02:29.849> going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> work<00:02:30.180> well

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
probably isn't going to work well

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.520 
probably isn't going to work well
because<00:02:30.569> we<00:02:30.780> don't<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.020> have<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> way<00:02:31.350> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
because we don't really have a way to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.620 
because we don't really have a way to
container<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.670> hold<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.970> back<00:02:33.150> side<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
container to hold the back side of the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.170 
container to hold the back side of the
line<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.380> um<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.760> least<00:02:35.910> not<00:02:36.060> without

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
line you know um at least not without

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
line you know um at least not without
blitzing<00:02:36.540> someone<00:02:37.020> else<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.440> something<00:02:37.800> along

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
blitzing someone else or something along

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.540 
blitzing someone else or something along
those<00:02:38.250> lines<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.410> here<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:40.709> again<00:02:40.830> shooting

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
those lines so here we go again shooting

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
those lines so here we go again shooting
for<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.790> again<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.630> we<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.140> know<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.440> is

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
just a regular the same original one the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.220 
just a regular the same original one the
a<00:02:45.360> gap<00:02:45.630> um<00:02:47.269> god<00:02:48.269> that's<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.660> funny<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.019> me<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
a gap um god that's so funny to me that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.140 
a gap um god that's so funny to me that
that's<00:02:49.440> actually<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> sim<00:02:50.370> concept<00:02:50.910> like

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
that's actually like a sim concept like

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.949 
that's actually like a sim concept like
you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.660> pretty<00:02:52.080> much<00:02:52.200> taken<00:02:52.620> directly<00:02:53.010> from

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
you know pretty much taken directly from

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.930 
you know pretty much taken directly from
you<00:02:54.959> know<00:02:55.049> an<00:02:55.170> NFL<00:02:55.470> playbook<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.519> just

comes up da yet like I said the only

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.190 
comes up da yet like I said the only
difference<00:03:00.269> between<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.840> blitz<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
difference between this blitz in the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.259 
difference between this blitz in the
Bill<00:03:01.410> Belichick<00:03:01.799> one<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> video<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:03.150> you

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269

Bill Belichick one in the video that you
can<00:03:03.299> watch<00:03:03.720> through<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> link<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:05.600> right

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
can watch through the link is that right

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.059 
can watch through the link is that right
there<00:03:06.780> everybody<00:03:07.110> gets<00:03:07.290> gets<00:03:07.620> picked<00:03:07.799> up<00:03:07.920> I

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
there everybody gets gets picked up I

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.020 
there everybody gets gets picked up I
mean<00:03:08.220> that's<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.459> thing<00:03:08.580> with<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> a-gap

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
mean that's the thing with the a-gap

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.539 
mean that's the thing with the a-gap
says<00:03:09.269> they're<00:03:09.390> really<00:03:09.630> consistent<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
says they're really consistent but the

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.220 
says they're really consistent but the
only<00:03:11.670> difference<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.630> strong<00:03:12.930> safety

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
only difference is the strong safety

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.100 
only difference is the strong safety
that<00:03:13.620> flies<00:03:13.890> up<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> B<00:03:14.400> gap<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.880> video<00:03:15.120> um

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
that flies up the B gap in the video um

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.259 
that flies up the B gap in the video um
still<00:03:16.620> untouched<00:03:16.980> though<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.459> mean<00:03:17.700> absolutely

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
still untouched though I mean absolutely

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.490 
still untouched though I mean absolutely
no<00:03:18.450> difference<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.019> fact<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.470> know

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
no difference in the fact that you know

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.990 
no difference in the fact that you know
he<00:03:19.650> doesn't<00:03:19.799> get<00:03:19.980> doesn't<00:03:20.430> get<00:03:20.519> chipped<00:03:20.850> or

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
he doesn't get doesn't get chipped or

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.960 
he doesn't get doesn't get chipped or
anything<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.590> kind<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.160> kind<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.489> interesting

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
anything so kind of kind of interesting

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.849 
anything so kind of kind of interesting
but<00:03:24.450> anyway<00:03:24.660> what<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> wanted<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.230> do<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.590> since

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
but anyway what I wanted to do is since

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.380 
but anyway what I wanted to do is since
you<00:03:26.280> know<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.670> already<00:03:27.090> kind<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.329> a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
you know this is already kind of a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.630 
you know this is already kind of a
concept<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.959> game<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.380> wanted<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.519> ahead

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
concept in the game I wanted to go ahead

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.319 
concept in the game I wanted to go ahead
and<00:03:30.030> try<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.829> get<00:03:31.829> us<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.040> different<00:03:32.220> concept<00:03:32.910> to

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
and try to get us a different concept to

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.599 
and try to get us a different concept to
go<00:03:33.870> ahead<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.410> with<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.190> what<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.400> did<00:03:35.489> is

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
go ahead and do it with so what I did is

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.210 
go ahead and do it with so what I did is

is<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> right<00:03:42.390> end<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.989> actually

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
is that the right end you can actually

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.460 
is that the right end you can actually
control<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.709> right<00:03:43.980> end<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:45.230> he's<00:03:46.230> gonna<00:03:46.380> be

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
control the right end and he's gonna be

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.800 
control the right end and he's gonna be
coming<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:47.040> pretty<00:03:47.370> much<00:03:47.640> untouched<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.690> know

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
coming in pretty much untouched you know

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.670 
coming in pretty much untouched you know
I<00:03:48.840> mean<00:03:49.350> no<00:03:49.709> real<00:03:50.660> no<00:03:51.660> real<00:03:51.900> resistance<00:03:52.260> you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
I mean no real no real resistance you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.780 
I mean no real no real resistance you
just<00:03:52.829> let<00:03:52.980> him<00:03:53.010> loop<00:03:53.190> around<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:53.760> you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
just let him loop around and then you

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.110 
just let him loop around and then you
use<00:03:54.030> them<00:03:54.180> right<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.540> quarterback<00:03:54.959> um

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
use them right to the quarterback um

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.580 
use them right to the quarterback um
what<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.630> do<00:03:57.750> though<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.200> do<00:03:58.410> it

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
what I like to do though and I do it

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.289 
what I like to do though and I do it
later<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.890> this<00:03:58.980> video<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.519> once<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.000> get<00:04:00.180> them

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
later in this video is once you get them

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.000 
later in this video is once you get them
like<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.630> trajectory<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> quarterback

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
like on a trajectory for the quarterback

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.590 
like on a trajectory for the quarterback
go<00:04:02.519> ahead<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.790> click<00:04:02.970> off<00:04:03.180> its<00:04:03.420> going<00:04:03.510> to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
go ahead and click off its going to

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.900 
go ahead and click off its going to
click<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> backside<00:04:04.620> contain<00:04:05.040> this

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
click on to the backside contain this

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.750 
click on to the backside contain this
concept<00:04:06.720> from<00:04:06.870> 416<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.650> gonna<00:04:07.829> work<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.430> would

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
concept from 416 is gonna work I would

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.099 
concept from 416 is gonna work I would
assume<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.090> would<00:04:09.150> work<00:04:09.299> from<00:04:09.510> nickel<00:04:09.810> as<00:04:09.930> well

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
assume it would work from nickel as well

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.160 
assume it would work from nickel as well
actually<00:04:10.410> but<00:04:11.310> um<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:12.060> gonna<00:04:12.209> work<00:04:12.480> from<00:04:13.019> any

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
actually but um it's gonna work from any

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.690 
actually but um it's gonna work from any
coverage<00:04:13.560> doesn't<00:04:13.980> really<00:04:14.190> matter<00:04:14.400> what<00:04:14.579> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
coverage doesn't really matter what the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.940 
coverage doesn't really matter what the
coverage<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:16.739> ahead<00:04:16.829> and

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
coverage is and you can go ahead and

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.170 
coverage is and you can go ahead and
just<00:04:17.130> loop<00:04:17.370> him<00:04:17.519> right<00:04:17.669> around<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:17.970> as<00:04:18.090> you

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
just loop him right around and as you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.879 
just loop him right around and as you
can<00:04:18.299> see<00:04:18.329> I'm<00:04:18.510> using<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.840> slow<00:04:19.169> DN<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.650> using

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
can see I'm using a slow DN of using

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.820 
can see I'm using a slow DN of using
Chris<00:04:20.070> Clemons<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.120> not<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.229> fastest<00:04:22.650> guy<00:04:22.800> in

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
Chris Clemons so not the fastest guy in

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.250 
Chris Clemons so not the fastest guy in
the<00:04:23.039> world<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.630> it's<00:04:24.750> going<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.900> work<00:04:25.110> with

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
the world so it's going to work with

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.659 
the world so it's going to work with
pretty<00:04:25.440> much<00:04:25.590> anybody<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.159> mean<00:04:26.370> basically

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
pretty much anybody I mean basically

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.350 
pretty much anybody I mean basically
just<00:04:26.970> want<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.180> let

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
just want to let

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.909 
just want to let
take<00:04:27.509> his<00:04:27.659> first<00:04:27.810> few<00:04:28.020> steps<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.409> that<00:04:28.439> contain

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
take his first few steps on that contain

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.499 
take his first few steps on that contain
so<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.550> can<00:04:29.759> get<00:04:29.819> them<00:04:29.969> outside<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.449> the

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
so you can get them outside of the

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.360 
so you can get them outside of the
tackle<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.349> safety<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.860> going<00:04:32.009> to<00:04:32.069> pick<00:04:32.219> up

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
tackle the safety is going to pick up

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.070 
tackle the safety is going to pick up
the<00:04:32.490> tackle<00:04:32.909> and<00:04:33.000> then<00:04:33.659> you're<00:04:33.780> going<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.930> have

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
the tackle and then you're going to have

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.110 
the tackle and then you're going to have
your<00:04:34.199> free<00:04:34.379> run<00:04:34.560> at<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.740> quarterback<00:04:35.159> you

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
your free run at the quarterback you

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.189 
your free run at the quarterback you
know<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:36.360> whatever<00:04:36.569> coverage<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.169> choose

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
know with whatever coverage you choose

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.929 
know with whatever coverage you choose
to<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.680> behind<00:04:38.009> it<00:04:38.189> that's<00:04:38.340> completely<00:04:38.759> up

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 
to have behind it that's completely up

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.990 
to have behind it that's completely up

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
but I mean if you want to roll zone you

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.159 
but I mean if you want to roll zone you
can<00:04:43.800> definitely<00:04:44.039> roll<00:04:44.400> zone<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:45.900> like<00:04:46.050> I

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
can definitely roll zone and then like I

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.839 
can definitely roll zone and then like I
said<00:04:46.409> once<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.740> get<00:04:46.889> near<00:04:47.219> the<00:04:47.250> quarterback

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
said once you get near the quarterback

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.369 
said once you get near the quarterback
you<00:04:48.090> want<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.360> go<00:04:48.449> ahead<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:48.750> click<00:04:48.960> off<00:04:49.169> at

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
you want to go ahead and click off at

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.749 
you want to go ahead and click off at
the<00:04:49.590> end<00:04:49.740> because<00:04:49.979> he's<00:04:50.250> going<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.460> get<00:04:50.550> like<00:04:50.729> a

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
the end because he's going to get like a

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.040 
the end because he's going to get like a
little<00:04:50.849> bit<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.300> speed<00:04:51.539> burst<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.960> the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
little bit of a speed burst to the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.020 
little bit of a speed burst to the
quarterback<00:04:52.349> that<00:04:52.680> way<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.039> you're<00:04:53.490> like<00:04:53.789> not

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
quarterback that way and you're like not

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.379 
quarterback that way and you're like not
risking<00:04:54.569> missing<00:04:55.469> a<00:04:55.740> tackle<00:04:56.159> or<00:04:57.150> being

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
risking missing a tackle or being

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.300 
risking missing a tackle or being
invaded<00:04:57.689> you<00:04:58.289> know<00:04:58.500> sometimes<00:04:58.919> hitting<00:04:59.250> a

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
invaded you know sometimes hitting a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.769 
invaded you know sometimes hitting a
moving<00:04:59.490> target<00:04:59.580> in<00:04:59.939> this<00:05:00.060> game<00:05:00.210> can<00:05:00.419> be<00:05:00.449> pretty

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
moving target in this game can be pretty

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.420 
moving target in this game can be pretty
rough<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.199> movement<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.710> year<00:05:01.949> is<00:05:02.069> kind<00:05:02.310> of

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
rough the movement this year is kind of

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.080 
rough the movement this year is kind of
difficult<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:04.250> when<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.460> can<00:05:05.759> let<00:05:05.969> the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
