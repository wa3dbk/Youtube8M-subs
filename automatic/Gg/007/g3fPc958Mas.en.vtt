00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the way around and compress the heart

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.899 
the way around and compress the heart
you<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.640> buckles<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you see here when doing the buckles and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.040 
you see here when doing the buckles and
let's<00:01:51.810> say<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> compress<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> bag<00:01:52.830> right<00:01:53.009> here

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
let's say to compress the bag right here

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.719 
let's say to compress the bag right here
and<00:01:55.050> then<00:01:55.289> underneath<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.009> put<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.369> drops

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and then underneath you put this drops

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.520 
and then underneath you put this drops
are<00:01:57.000> attached<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.660> bike<00:01:57.840> so<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
are attached to the bike so this is the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.230 
are attached to the bike so this is the
same<00:02:01.710> idea<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.429> other<00:02:02.640> side<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> bow

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
same idea on the other side be the bow

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.950 
same idea on the other side be the bow
on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> bottom<00:02:03.840> right<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.420> undo<00:02:06.810> their

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
on the bottom right so just undo their

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.380 
on the bottom right so just undo their
straps<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> whole<00:02:09.030> thing<00:02:09.209> comes

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
straps and then the whole thing comes

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.020 
straps and then the whole thing comes
away<00:02:09.649> obviously<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.709> need<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:17.489> can<00:02:17.640> see<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
away obviously I need to you can see the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.500 
away obviously I need to you can see the
stops<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.780> talks<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.319> bike
