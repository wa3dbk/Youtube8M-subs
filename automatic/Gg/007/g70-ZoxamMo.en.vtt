two<00:00:10.590> screws<00:00:11.190> might<00:00:11.670> want<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> mark<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.420> you

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
two screws might want to mark it so you

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930 
two screws might want to mark it so you
know<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.780> goes<00:00:12.960> back<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.700> pull<00:00:14.700> out<00:00:14.820> the

the<00:00:32.360> sprocket<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:34.700> now<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> sprocket<00:00:36.360> has

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the sprocket here now the sprocket has

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
the sprocket here now the sprocket has
two<00:00:36.989> set<00:00:37.890> screws

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 

which<00:00:41.340> hold<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
which hold it in and you just have to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
loosen these now to get to the screws

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.450 
loosen these now to get to the screws
press<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.640> trigger<00:00:51.739> turn<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> until<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
press down the trigger turn it until the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
press down the trigger turn it until the
screws<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> screw<00:00:55.230> heads

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
screws you can just see the screw heads

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.910 
screws you can just see the screw heads
there<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.010> either<00:00:56.220> side<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.199> this<00:00:58.199> post<00:00:58.589> you'll

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
there on either side of this post you'll

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.710 
there on either side of this post you'll
see<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.190> screw<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.489> either<00:00:59.670> side<00:01:00.860> then<00:01:02.720> move

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
see a screw on either side then move

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.810 
see a screw on either side then move
these<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.350> bit<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.700> could

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
these out a little bit and you could

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
these out a little bit and you could
loosen<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.479> over<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.100> right

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
loosen them over here this one right

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.120 
loosen them over here this one right
here<00:01:08.930> there's<00:01:09.930> another<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.490> right<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.520> here

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
here there's another one right over here

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.899 
here there's another one right over here
once<00:01:14.130> you've<00:01:14.369> done<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.719 

the<00:01:19.899> baffle<00:01:20.380> plate<00:01:20.649> will<00:01:21.310> lift<00:01:21.549> that<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:24.670> of

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
the baffle plate will lift that kind of

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.190 
the baffle plate will lift that kind of
work<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.119> out<00:01:25.240> like<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:25.689> this<00:01:25.930> one<00:01:26.079> is

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
work it out like this this one is

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.090 
work it out like this this one is
already<00:01:26.350> out<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.720> there<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.320> go<00:01:29.560> comes<00:01:29.920> out

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
already out and there we go comes out

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.240 
already out and there we go comes out
like<00:01:30.280> this<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.869> there<00:01:32.110> may<00:01:32.259> be<00:01:32.289> some<00:01:32.649> washers

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
like this now there may be some washers

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.770 
like this now there may be some washers
over<00:01:33.310> here<00:01:33.939> so<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.329> might<00:01:34.450> have<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.630> take

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
over here so you might have to take

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.700 
over here so you might have to take
those<00:01:34.929> off<00:01:35.200> set<00:01:35.860> them<00:01:36.100> aside<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:38.409> is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
those off set them aside and there is

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.389 
those off set them aside and there is
the<00:01:39.009> inside<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.850> k3<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.860> spring<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.369> in

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
the inside of the k3 the spring is in

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.029 
the inside of the k3 the spring is in
here<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.899> gate<00:01:44.110> would<00:01:44.350> be<00:01:44.500> over<00:01:44.710> there<00:01:44.890> this

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
here the gate would be over there this

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.460 
here the gate would be over there this
is<00:01:45.100> k4<00:01:45.460> he<00:01:45.520> doesn't<00:01:45.759> navigate<00:01:46.409> where<00:01:47.409> the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
is k4 he doesn't navigate where the

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.840 
is k4 he doesn't navigate where the
battery<00:01:47.770> goes<00:01:48.039> there's<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> little<00:01:48.700> light

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
battery goes there's a little light

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.309 
battery goes there's a little light
meter<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:51.700> see<00:01:52.119> how<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.420> loop<00:01:52.689> former<00:01:53.200> is

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
meter you can see how the loop former is

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.899 
meter you can see how the loop former is
work<00:01:54.390> there's<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.450> little<00:01:55.689> string<00:01:56.610> which<00:01:57.610> pulls

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
work there's a little string which pulls

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.300 
work there's a little string which pulls
the<00:01:58.090> math<00:01:58.299> if<00:01:58.840> your<00:01:59.080> loop<00:01:59.319> formers<00:01:59.799> aren't

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
the math if your loop formers aren't

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.910 
the math if your loop formers aren't
retracting<00:02:01.000> it's<00:02:01.209> because<00:02:01.659> something<00:02:02.649> has

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
retracting it's because something has

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.609 
retracting it's because something has
happened<00:02:03.069> over<00:02:03.520> here<00:02:03.789> if<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:05.080> want<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.439> remove

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
happened over here if you want to remove

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.210 
happened over here if you want to remove
the<00:02:05.799> loop<00:02:05.950> formers<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:07.479> unscrew<00:02:08.200> over<00:02:08.830> here

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the loop formers just unscrew over here

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.400 
the loop formers just unscrew over here
take<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.700> string<00:02:10.000> app<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.420> that's<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.230> you've

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
take the string app and that's it you've

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.150 
take the string app and that's it you've
got<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> Avery<00:02:12.220> with<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.519> loop<00:02:12.730> farmers
