00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.920 
into the dough
now<00:00:04.859> as<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.609> eyeball<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.330> do<00:00:06.480> like<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.660> say

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
now as the eyeball it we do like to say

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.390 
now as the eyeball it we do like to say
you<00:00:06.990> want<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.290> cut<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.589> about<00:00:07.830> eight<00:00:08.130> inches

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
you want to cut it about eight inches

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.339 
you want to cut it about eight inches
long<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.389> keep<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.019> not<00:00:10.110> too

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
long and you have to keep it not too

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.440 
long and you have to keep it not too
thick<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.860> usually<00:00:11.460> use<00:00:11.610> my<00:00:11.639> cutter<00:00:12.059> just<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
thick I usually use my cutter just a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
thick I usually use my cutter just a
measure<00:00:12.630> without<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.380> very<00:00:13.559> good<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.889> eyes

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
measure without not very good with eyes

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.810 
measure without not very good with eyes
open<00:00:14.549> -<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.599> you're<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> cut<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
open - so you're just going to cut it

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.210 
open - so you're just going to cut it
into<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.940> nice<00:00:18.119> little<00:00:18.150> strip<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.220> then

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
into a nice little strip here and then

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.160 
into a nice little strip here and then
as<00:00:20.490> Alison<00:00:21.000> noticed<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.869> line

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
as Alison noticed you have this line

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.269 
as Alison noticed you have this line
that<00:00:22.410> you're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> stretch<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
that you're going to stretch it out to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.580 
that you're going to stretch it out to
so<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.119> dough<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.630> sensitive<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.470> want

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so our dough is sensitive we don't want

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.200 
so our dough is sensitive we don't want
to<00:00:25.650> roll<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.800> too<00:00:26.070> much<00:00:26.279> because<00:00:26.670> our<00:00:26.820> tonsils

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to roll it too much because our tonsils

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.880 
to roll it too much because our tonsils
are<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.449> fluffy<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
are like fluffy which is going to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.179 
are like fluffy which is going to
stretch<00:00:29.490> our<00:00:29.760> dough<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.320> first<00:00:31.320> then<00:00:32.009> we're

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
stretch our dough out first then we're

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.380 
stretch our dough out first then we're
going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> drop<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.610> we're<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> roll<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to drop it we're going to roll it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.240 
going to drop it we're going to roll it
okay<00:00:34.110> even<00:00:34.410> though<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> called<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
okay even though this is called the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250 
okay even though this is called the
rolling<00:00:35.640> position<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> follow<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
rolling position I like to follow the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250 
rolling position I like to follow the
direction<00:00:37.910> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.540> fastest<00:00:39.960> rollers

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
direction you can the fastest rollers

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.510 
direction you can the fastest rollers
this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.920> stretches<00:00:41.309> what

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this is some just stretches what

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.119 
this is some just stretches what
stretching<00:00:41.940> twisting<00:00:42.829> we'll<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.100> have

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
stretching twisting we'll see if we have
