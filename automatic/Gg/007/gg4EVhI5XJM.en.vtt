look at them on paper that just stats
and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.870> too<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> Patriots

and I think it too good for the Patriots
this<00:01:02.070> year<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.420> via<00:01:03.780> first

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
this year so I think they get via first

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.590 
this year so I think they get via first
see<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.619> Ravens<00:01:05.460> second<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.240> income

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
see the Ravens second to the income

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
bolding um ray rice Joe Flacco I think

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.929

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.500 
vikings in 49ers vikings are two good
49ers<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.800> good<00:02:13.040> yet<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.760> compete<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.470 
49ers on that good yet to compete in the
playoffs<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.590> they<00:02:15.710> get<00:02:15.890> knocked<00:02:16.130> out

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480

playoffs I think they get knocked out
and<00:02:17.480> same<00:02:18.110> with<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.320> Falcons<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.860> think<00:02:19.070> Green

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.530 
and same with the Falcons I think Green

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.050 
year and too good for Atlanta and knock
them<00:02:23.300> out<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.710> would<00:02:25.070> leave<00:02:25.100> New<00:02:26.030> Orleans

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060

coming out very tough AFC submission
this<00:02:53.720> year<00:02:53.900> i<00:02:54.140> think<00:02:54.260> they<00:02:54.650> knock<00:02:54.860> off<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
this year i think they knock off the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.370 
this year i think they knock off the
chargers<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.570> i<00:02:57.820> think<00:02:58.820> with<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.959> Bengals

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.930 
chargers and i think with the Bengals
and<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.530> Colts<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.160> poles<00:03:01.430> are<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.760> too

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
and the Colts the poles are just too

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.060 
and the Colts the poles are just too
nasty<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.510> playoffs<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.530> Bengals<00:03:03.980> are

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
nasty in the playoffs the Bengals are

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.060

personally<00:03:43.220> i<00:03:43.400> think<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:44.000> saints<00:03:44.209> are<00:03:44.330> too

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510

good<00:03:44.720> Brett<00:03:45.560> Favre<00:03:45.800> would<00:03:45.950> get<00:03:46.130> tired<00:03:46.370> warm

down<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.110> think<00:03:48.410> these<00:03:49.010> Saints<00:03:49.430> would

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
down and I think these Saints would

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.970 
down and I think these Saints would
again<00:03:50.120> knock<00:03:50.630> off<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.900> Vikings<00:03:51.500> ending<00:03:51.890> the

have<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.180> Baltimore<00:04:18.450> Ravens<00:04:18.930> against<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
have the Baltimore Ravens against the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.270 
have the Baltimore Ravens against the
Indianapolis<00:04:20.760> Colts<00:04:22.040> looking<00:04:23.040> at<00:04:23.190> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
Indianapolis Colts looking at the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.420 
Indianapolis Colts looking at the
Patriots<00:04:23.820> in<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:24.090> jet<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.800> would<00:04:25.800> love<00:04:26.070> to

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
Patriots in the a jet I would love to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.570 
Patriots in the a jet I would love to
say<00:04:26.790> for<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.480> Patriots<00:04:27.960> win<00:04:28.230> but<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:29.070> year<00:04:29.310> I

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
say for the Patriots win but this year I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.730 
say for the Patriots win but this year I
just<00:04:30.270> don't<00:04:30.450> think<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.200> death<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.560> two

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
just don't think so the death of two

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.909 
just don't think so the death of two
packed<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.660> stacked<00:04:33.660> on<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.169> Arab<00:04:34.380> roster

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
packed and stacked on the Arab roster

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.640 
packed and stacked on the Arab roster
they<00:04:35.669> got<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:35.910> great<00:04:36.240> quarterback<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:37.200> great

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
they got a great quarterback and great

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.530 
they got a great quarterback and great
defense<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.340> lot<00:04:38.490> better<00:04:38.669> than<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.060> Patriots

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
defense a lot better than the Patriots

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.420 
defense a lot better than the Patriots
so<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.750> think<00:04:39.960> that's<00:04:40.230> what<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.680> boils<00:04:40.710> down<00:04:41.070> to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
so I think that's what it boils down to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.320 
so I think that's what it boils down to
ends<00:04:42.360> on<00:04:42.480> with<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.260> colts<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.620> ravens<00:04:44.330> again

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
ends on with the colts and ravens again

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.950 
ends on with the colts and ravens again
i<00:04:45.600> think<00:04:46.910> just<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:47.970> ravens<00:04:48.419> wouldn't<00:04:48.690> end<00:04:48.870> up

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
i think just the ravens wouldn't end up

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.610 
i think just the ravens wouldn't end up
beating<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.440> colts<00:04:49.710> i<00:04:50.510> think<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.630> cold<00:04:51.870> magic

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
beating the colts i think the cold magic

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.190 
beating the colts i think the cold magic
in<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.010> playoffs<00:04:53.340> would<00:04:53.700> end<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.990> would

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
in the playoffs would end and it would

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.379 
in the playoffs would end and it would
be<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.860> ravens<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.790> jets<00:04:57.229> two<00:04:58.229> stacked

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
be the ravens and the jets two stacked

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.170 
be the ravens and the jets two stacked
roster<00:05:00.389> in<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.200> NFL<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:01.710> year<00:05:02.000> facing<00:05:03.000> off

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
roster in the NFL this year facing off

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.110 
roster in the NFL this year facing off
all<00:05:03.870> right<00:05:04.020> um<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:05.070> here<00:05:05.250> we<00:05:05.370> go<00:05:05.400> NFC

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
all right um so here we go NFC

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.379 
all right um so here we go NFC
championship<00:05:06.750> game<00:05:06.780> um<00:05:07.500> once<00:05:08.430> again<00:05:08.610> I'm

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
championship game um once again I'm

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.300 
championship game um once again I'm
gonna<00:05:09.600> say<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.139> scenes<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.620> believe<00:05:11.040> will<00:05:11.160> make

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
gonna say the scenes I believe will make

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.460 
gonna say the scenes I believe will make
the<00:05:11.460> Super<00:05:11.729> Bowl<00:05:11.760> knock<00:05:12.210> off<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.720> Dallas

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
the Super Bowl knock off the Dallas

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.740 
the Super Bowl knock off the Dallas
Cowboys<00:05:13.889> so<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.669> believe<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.450> Saints

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
Cowboys so I believe that the Saints

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.550 
Cowboys so I believe that the Saints
hope<00:05:15.870> represents<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:17.010> NFC<00:05:17.690> with<00:05:18.690> Drew<00:05:19.410> Brees

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
hope represents the NFC with Drew Brees

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.370 
hope represents the NFC with Drew Brees
and<00:05:20.419> all<00:05:21.419> their<00:05:21.630> other<00:05:21.750> guys<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.200> that<00:05:22.320> team

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
and all their other guys on that team

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.630 
and all their other guys on that team
hands<00:05:23.280> for<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.820> AFC<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:25.160> think<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.280> boils<00:05:26.430> down

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
hands for the AFC I think it boils down

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.300 
hands for the AFC I think it boils down
to<00:05:27.570> who<00:05:27.750> has<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:27.990> better<00:05:28.260> defense<00:05:28.410> because<00:05:29.190> both

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
to who has a better defense because both

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.680 
to who has a better defense because both
these<00:05:29.610> teams<00:05:29.789> right<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.330> have<00:05:30.479> great

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
these teams right you have great

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.350 
these teams right you have great
offenses<00:05:31.289> great<00:05:32.190> quarterbacks<00:05:33.000> wide

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
offenses great quarterbacks wide

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.620 
offenses great quarterbacks wide
receivers<00:05:33.840> running<00:05:34.110> backs<00:05:34.520> so<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:36.120> would<00:05:36.390> boil

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
receivers running backs so it would boil

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.290 
receivers running backs so it would boil
down<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.110> Defense<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.830> who<00:05:38.039> would<00:05:38.220> stop<00:05:38.550> the

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
down the Defense and who would stop the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.000 
down the Defense and who would stop the
opposing<00:05:39.690> team<00:05:39.900> from<00:05:40.110> getting<00:05:40.500> into<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.800> end

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
opposing team from getting into the end

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.950 
opposing team from getting into the end
zone<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.400> personally<00:05:42.390> I<00:05:42.419> think<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.870> would

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
zone and personally I think that would

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.900 
zone and personally I think that would
be<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.200> Jets<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.800> think<00:05:44.310> they<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.729> bad

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
be the Jets I think they have the bad

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.850 
be the Jets I think they have the bad
defense<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.870> think<00:05:46.139> they<00:05:46.260> would<00:05:46.410> knock<00:05:46.620> off

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
defense and I think they would knock off

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.260 
defense and I think they would knock off
the<00:05:47.639> Baltimore<00:05:48.210> Ravens<00:05:48.590> leaving<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.910> Jets

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
the Baltimore Ravens leaving the Jets

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.950 
the Baltimore Ravens leaving the Jets
the<00:05:51.720> Saints<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.530> collide<00:05:52.889> in<00:05:53.160> super<00:05:53.520> bowl<00:05:53.960> now

me which team you think would win

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.480 
me which team you think would win
personally<00:06:00.450> I<00:06:00.680> think<00:06:01.680> it's<00:06:01.950> a<00:06:02.100> jets<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.550> year

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
personally I think it's a jets this year

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.200 
personally I think it's a jets this year
so<00:06:05.600> that's<00:06:06.600> my<00:06:06.840> prediction<00:06:07.070> Jets<00:06:08.070> super<00:06:09.060> bowl

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
so that's my prediction Jets super bowl

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.340 
so that's my prediction Jets super bowl
champions<00:06:09.720> for<00:06:09.930> 2010<00:06:11.090> just<00:06:12.090> because<00:06:12.450> of<00:06:12.690> how

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
champions for 2010 just because of how

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.460
