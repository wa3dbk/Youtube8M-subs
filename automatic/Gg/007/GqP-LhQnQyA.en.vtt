00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.300
 hello i'm leaving because today 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 it's training three times a week 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890
 we have looked at the variant 1 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.449
 That's actually the push pull plan 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.890
 easy to do one after the other 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 Now let's have a look 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.260
 Variant 2 to the variant 2 is already 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 the full body training plan one 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 or others have shown what is this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.140
 I have to start at the very beginning 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.100
 do not do the first three until 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.870
 four years 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.430
 when it comes to jason blaha from ice cream 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 fitness goes the first three to four 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 years can do that you can calm 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.670
 also fall back later 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.879
 if you just set the rhythm to three times 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 would like to take down every week because 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.590
 something comes to the family 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.199
 the work otherwise what that means 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.850
 Threefold split as you know it otherwise 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.859
 once the group had to do weekly 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 Although it makes sense from the regeneration 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.600
 may be for one or the other 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 who has so much muscle mass that she 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.159
 long time to regenerate needs 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.530
 the latest findings also like there 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.330
 that makes sense for us natural 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 we do not train so much yet 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 we should have muscle mass 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.049
 that we two to three times each 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.119
 muscle group does not burden muscle like that 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.380
 failing that was me today now 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.330
 time to say it is in fact very, very 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.909
 important with this plan not until 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 Muscle fail but really only with 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.820
 85 percent of the web is growing 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.619
 intensity, so to speak 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.710
 and then we look at each other like that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.540
 The whole body plan could look like this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.670
 of course, the exercises neat 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.549
 you can still slimmed it down 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.259
 I think so, yes 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.610
 kkb in brackets depending on behind 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.890
 is written then we press 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.960
 absolutely everything still flat bench press 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.759
 want to do that can do that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 I have it for some reasons 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.530
 I do not recommend it you know the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 reasons but this would be flat 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.140
 may want five to six times eight 56 x 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.410
 85 x 6 to 8 with that start then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 Dumbbell shoulder back 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.470
 so the shoulders wake up the push 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.780
 chain first will press 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 shrek bank back in dumbbells 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.620
 shoulder press five times six to eight 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.750
 tips three times six to eight silver 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.320
 if we actually switch to the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.640
 So three times 18 24 times go violent yes 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.530
 three times a week 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.060
 then we have the whole story 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.150
 of course a bit more than ours 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.340
 60 repeat 72 but that is still 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.650
 of course, then we have 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.780
 actually more or less the poles 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.330
 with two exercises or an exercise 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.790
 row and cross your eyes you see 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.530
 Isolation exercises are out of here 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.450
 we like the biggest one 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.850
 possible already three times a week 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.440
 but without failing to go to muscle 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.500
 we have to set that up so we have to set one 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.990
 clever combination of exercises they offer 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.600
 Of course, the basic exercises row on 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.360
 one day cross the other hand 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.640
 biceps curls sit that is actually 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.110
 then again our porsche porsche 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.110
 with that whole body flash and then 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.110
 already goes to the legs squat on 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.020
 day but in the press office b you have to look 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.670
 again how you regenerate it like you 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.380
 generally the whole body plan 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.180
 regenerated then can of course set 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.100
 isolations can be lost with you 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.550
 others go in if you say human 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.100
 I can not stand that rule 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.630
 not exactly as you say 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.780
 can okay as I said I'm doing 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.700
 put away or whatever if that 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.230
 full-body training plan of course not 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.320
 then you should regenerate on the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.270
 Push pull just over one and two and 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.760
 one and two and so on should you 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:52.510
 So do as what's said here 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.160
 have or variant 1.1.2011 cabbage two 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.230
 Of course there are the solo albums 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.750
 businessman here with this variant one 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.489
 a bit more regeneration time there 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.550
 that goes to a whole body workout 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.690
 quiet times for a few weeks the first 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.550
 a few weeks we will hell 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.380
 be because the regeneration of course 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.000
 afterwards, just try it 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.060
 of whether we are not perhaps 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.430
 regional herring can be said 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.750
 Squats and interest 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.870
 if you rune and cross-raise one 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.459
 It must be on a war footing 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.710
 you personally find out for you what 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.940
 can you regenerate and what can you do 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.139
 not and of course you have to 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.410
 change accordingly 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.860
 ok then real life was just sitting 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.100
 stand 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.990
 I 'll do a little question mark 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.520
 here because that's actually already 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.310
 again isolation exercises 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.530
 but the waiters often do not like it 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.910
 But we want men from one 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.160
 androgen receptors you are us 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.900
 normally poorly positioned 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.669
 That's why I took her in 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.039
 simply because of that was also many 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.870
 ask for the words I have last 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.280
 already mentioned after the elections also 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.110
 how do I train the carriages? 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:04.590
 best 36 83 68 then we have it 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.360
 even nine sets each week 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.400
 apology 18 sat the week 18 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.020
 took place in the week our 16 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.970
 put it is a bit much like 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.979
 You may also be able to say two 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.780
 or three I have now 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.240
 just a little bit with taste 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.169
 with three sentences each brought in the 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.750
 machine 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.380
 We also have our desk with us 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.630
 in there twice 6 to 8 2 x 8 are 16 times 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.940
 three, then we are quite good again 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:36.159
 it is always the same 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.460
 ask, do not squat 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:41.979
 should cross to lift the not quite 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.810
 push the beginning yes you can 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.000
 Of course you can do this 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.039
 complex exercises to the simpler ones 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.070
 Exercises you just have to look like 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.080
 a lot of time he brings to the studio okay 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.500
 that means if I of course the 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.419
 All I have to warm up here 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.130
 no longer no longer here I have to 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.650
 I do not have to warm up here anymore 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.759
 warm me up here and here actually 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.409
 no more 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.889
 that means if I of course that here 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.940
 I have to warm up there 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.120
 and then I have to go back to who 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.409
 I have to stop you know what 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.780
 I mean here should actually the 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.970
 I prefer dare but you can 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.050
 Of course, that's what you do yourself 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.509
 no problem 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.560
 so now on a topic i have extra 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.820
 of all people, I hope so 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.110
 I think it's no, that's one 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.180
 Team on another video 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.250
 Unfortunately, I have the note right now 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.730
 misplaced and that is about the time 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.650
 I think we come here with about 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.900
 1.5 hours we come here with rainer 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.850
 training time without warming up so for 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.130
 the rates are 30 seconds for the 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.810
 We expect to break for two minutes 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.240
 About one and a half hours 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.800
 next time we are completely body 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.450
 disconnect only twice a week 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.220
 it is neat it is already 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.930
 more difficult that means there we already have 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.850
 I always believe in 1 at 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.750
 two and a half hours or something like that 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:06.169
 here we are at 90 to 105 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.540
 minutes something to the rotation 1.5 to 1.7 5 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.070
 Hours are one and a quarter hours 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.630
 that's all ok 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.580
 no head around the cortisol 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.410
 that's where I come from 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.229
 we'll see each other next time 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.750
 again when it's called whole body workout 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.490
 Twice a week then the whole thing 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.550
 Of course it would be longer now 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.200
 have to do more repetitions 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.030
 then come the isolation exercises 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.370
 again with pure but the time is 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.789
 longer but at the time and cortisol and 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.560
 so on because it goes after all 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.400
 body with two men of the week see 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.400
 we'll be fine again
