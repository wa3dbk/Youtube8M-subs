according to the US Census Bureau Asian

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
according to the US Census Bureau Asian
women<00:00:42.780> are<00:00:43.079> three<00:00:43.320> times<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.620> likely<00:00:43.739> to

would be harder because I have had like

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.919 
would be harder because I have had like
