had it done my fish would ever had it so
I<00:00:34.140> didn't<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> do

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
I didn't really know what to do

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.979 
I didn't really know what to do
obviously<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> needed<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.320> treatment<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
obviously I needed a treatment so

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
obviously I needed a treatment so
luckily<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.500> money<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.309> went<00:00:41.640> out

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
luckily I had some money and I went out

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850 
luckily I had some money and I went out
at<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> end<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.719> anti-feminism<00:00:43.469> fin

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
at the end got some anti-feminism fin

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.709 
at the end got some anti-feminism fin
rot<00:00:44.100> control<00:00:44.809> that's<00:00:45.809> made<00:00:46.079> by<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> pet<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
rot control that's made by in the pet I

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.709 
rot control that's made by in the pet I
think<00:00:48.719> these<00:00:48.870> only<00:00:49.170> sell<00:00:49.760> formulas<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> UK

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
think these only sell formulas in the UK

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.560 
think these only sell formulas in the UK
and<00:00:52.100> I<00:00:53.100> doubt<00:00:53.340> you'll<00:00:53.550> sell<00:00:53.789> them<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.059> America

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and I doubt you'll sell them in America

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.380 
and I doubt you'll sell them in America
or<00:00:54.899> anywhere<00:00:54.960> else<00:00:55.520> because<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> British

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
or anywhere else because it's a British

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.049 
or anywhere else because it's a British
company<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.949> yeah<00:00:59.460> I've<00:00:59.579> had<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.000> key

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
rot is actually been advancing very

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
rot is actually been advancing very
quickly<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.470> mean<00:01:16.710> last<00:01:16.950> night<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.369> only<00:01:17.520> had<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
quickly I mean last night you only had a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.330 
quickly I mean last night you only had a
few<00:01:18.030> notches<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.780> till<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.890> his<00:01:20.040> tails

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
few notches I was till now his tails

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.929 
few notches I was till now his tails
totally<00:01:21.030> rugged<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> reason<00:01:23.700> why<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
totally rugged so and the reason why I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.690 
totally rugged so and the reason why I
think<00:01:24.180> he<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.430> he<00:01:26.549> was

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
think he got it is because he was

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.550 
think he got it is because he was
stressed<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.270> he's<00:01:27.570> been<00:01:27.750> moved<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.320> here

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
stressed because he's been moved in here

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.270 
stressed because he's been moved in here
and<00:01:29.210> he's<00:01:30.210> cut<00:01:30.869> steel<00:01:31.259> slightly<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.009> piece

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and he's cut steel slightly on the piece

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
and he's cut steel slightly on the piece
of<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.759> cause<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
of this would cause some of it is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.700 
of this would cause some of it is
slightly<00:01:34.650> sharp<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.579> yeah<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> he's<00:01:37.560> been

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
slightly sharp but yeah so he's been

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.450 
slightly sharp but yeah so he's been
stressed<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> he's<00:01:38.549> cut<00:01:38.790> steel<00:01:39.060> slightly<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
stressed and he's cut steel slightly and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.240 
stressed and he's cut steel slightly and
it's<00:01:41.460> letting<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:42.710> bacteria<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.130> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it's letting some bacteria I think it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's letting some bacteria I think it's
a<00:01:44.310> bacterial<00:01:44.850> infection<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:46.079> he<00:01:46.140> seems<00:01:46.409> as

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
a bacterial infection but he seems as

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
a bacterial infection but he seems as
normal<00:01:46.979> self<00:01:47.220> he's<00:01:47.430> swimming<00:01:47.670> around<00:01:47.970> he's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
normal self he's swimming around he's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
normal self he's swimming around he's
come<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.200> us<00:01:49.229> he's<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:49.979> happy<00:01:50.220> he's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
come to see us he's very happy he's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.850 
come to see us he's very happy he's
eaten<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.509> good<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> know<00:01:52.680> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
is teal to very rugged it's almost like

too good I think I've caught it
relatively<00:02:03.630> early<00:02:05.479> because<00:02:06.479> last<00:02:06.810> night<00:02:06.930> was

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
relatively early because last night was

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.070 
relatively early because last night was
just<00:02:07.439> really<00:02:07.799> starting<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.629> well<00:02:09.629> that's<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
just really starting and well that's the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.390 
just really starting and well that's the
only<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> first<00:02:10.950> time<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.220> actually

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
only that's the first time I actually

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.590 
only that's the first time I actually
noticed<00:02:11.790> that

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
noticed that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.500 
noticed that
but<00:02:13.290> yeah<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> am<00:02:14.460> treating<00:02:14.850> them<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> should

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
but yeah I am treating them and should

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.650 
but yeah I am treating them and should
get<00:02:15.720> better<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.880> years<00:02:18.300> behave<00:02:19.080> normally<00:02:19.380> oh

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
get better but years behave normally oh

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.710 
get better but years behave normally oh
I've<00:02:21.660> lost<00:02:21.900> them<00:02:22.080> where<00:02:22.290> he<00:02:22.410> went<00:02:22.530> oh<00:02:22.770> there<00:02:23.370> is

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I've lost them where he went oh there is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.760 
I've lost them where he went oh there is
chemists<00:02:24.720> leaps<00:02:24.930> underneath<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.530> piece<00:02:25.740> of

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
chemists leaps underneath that piece of

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770 
chemists leaps underneath that piece of
wood<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.090> see<00:02:27.300> there's<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
wood there as you can see there's like a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.480 
wood there as you can see there's like a
hole<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.350> anything<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:29.070> sleeps<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
hole and anything just sleeps in the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.620 
hole and anything just sleeps in the
back<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.580> never<00:02:32.850> really<00:02:33.150> same<00:02:33.420> in
