because<00:05:32.110> as<00:05:32.409> I<00:05:33.069> said<00:05:33.129> when<00:05:33.490> he<00:05:33.580> throws<00:05:33.819> the

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
because as I said when he throws the

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.369 
because as I said when he throws the
right<00:05:34.180> hand<00:05:34.389> drops<00:05:34.509> left<00:05:34.899> when<00:05:35.110> he<00:05:35.139> throws

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379 
right hand drops left when he throws

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.709 
right hand drops left when he throws
left<00:05:35.680> he<00:05:35.800> drops<00:05:36.069> the<00:05:36.279> right<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.240> he<00:05:37.360> can<00:05:37.569> be

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
left he drops the right so he can be

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.029 
left he drops the right so he can be
countered<00:05:38.080> like<00:05:38.229> that<00:05:38.409> but<00:05:38.560> he<00:05:38.620> does<00:05:38.800> that

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
countered like that but he does that

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.439 
countered like that but he does that
himself<00:05:39.279> as<00:05:39.669> well<00:05:39.849> he's<00:05:40.029> good<00:05:40.210> with<00:05:40.360> the

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
himself as well he's good with the

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.879 
himself as well he's good with the
timing<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:42.060> he's<00:05:43.060> not<00:05:43.270> very<00:05:43.479> fast<00:05:43.889> decent

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
timing and he's not very fast decent

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.860 
timing and he's not very fast decent
speed<00:05:45.159> I<00:05:45.339> think<00:05:45.819> he<00:05:45.969> will<00:05:46.149> be<00:05:46.300> vulnerable<00:05:46.569> to

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
speed I think he will be vulnerable to

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.110 
speed I think he will be vulnerable to
top<00:05:47.229> boxers<00:05:47.710> because<00:05:47.979> because<00:05:48.879> of<00:05:49.000> his

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
top boxers because because of his

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.829 
top boxers because because of his
shorter<00:05:49.419> reach<00:05:49.629> they'll<00:05:50.349> be<00:05:50.469> able<00:05:50.560> to<00:05:50.680> just<00:05:51.839> be

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:52.839 
shorter reach they'll be able to just be

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:58.070 
shorter reach they'll be able to just be
able<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.050> keep<00:05:53.229> him<00:05:53.469> away<00:05:53.710> from<00:05:55.379> the<00:05:56.379> from<00:05:57.129> them
