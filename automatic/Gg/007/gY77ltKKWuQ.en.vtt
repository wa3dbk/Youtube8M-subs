super<00:07:30.199> easy<00:07:30.229> I<00:07:30.860> know<00:07:30.919> some<00:07:31.430> people<00:07:31.580> have<00:07:31.909> some

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
super easy I know some people have some

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.260 
super easy I know some people have some
trouble<00:07:32.690> when<00:07:33.409> they<00:07:33.699> curl<00:07:34.699> their<00:07:34.880> hair<00:07:34.909> with<00:07:35.240> a

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
trouble when they curl their hair with a

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.990 
trouble when they curl their hair with a
straightener<00:07:35.750> by<00:07:35.930> getting<00:07:36.229> that<00:07:36.349> crease<00:07:37.000> I

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
straightener by getting that crease I

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.969 
straightener by getting that crease I
mean<00:07:38.330> by<00:07:38.750> all<00:07:38.780> means<00:07:39.199> try<00:07:39.530> and<00:07:39.650> find<00:07:39.860> a

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:39.979 
mean by all means try and find a

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:41.770 
mean by all means try and find a
straightener<00:07:40.430> that<00:07:40.610> has<00:07:40.789> floating<00:07:41.419> plates

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
straightener that has floating plates

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.620 
straightener that has floating plates
because<00:07:42.590> then<00:07:42.830> the<00:07:43.039> sides<00:07:43.669> are<00:07:43.970> hot<00:07:44.150> as<00:07:44.360> well

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:44.630 
because then the sides are hot as well

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.050 
because then the sides are hot as well
makes<00:07:45.020> it<00:07:45.139> so<00:07:45.349> much<00:07:45.500> easier<00:07:45.560> to<00:07:46.159> curl<00:07:46.370> that<00:07:46.759> way

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.060 
makes it so much easier to curl that way

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.560 
makes it so much easier to curl that way
you<00:07:47.120> won't<00:07:47.389> get<00:07:47.720> those<00:07:47.930> weird<00:07:48.259> pleats<00:07:48.620> but<00:07:48.919> uh

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:49.570 
you won't get those weird pleats but uh

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.930 
you won't get those weird pleats but uh
pleats<00:07:50.570> that's<00:07:50.900> the<00:07:51.050> right<00:07:51.199> word<00:07:51.349> right<00:07:51.940> but

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:52.940 
pleats that's the right word right but

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.999 
pleats that's the right word right but
