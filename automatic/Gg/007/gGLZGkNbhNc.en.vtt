hardest thing about skateboarding has to

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.990 
hardest thing about skateboarding has to
be<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.420> concrete<00:04:32.870> because<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:34.460> can't<00:04:34.700> roll

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
be the concrete because you can't roll

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.630 
be the concrete because you can't roll
out<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.390> that<00:04:35.510> too<00:04:35.750> easily<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.680> think<00:04:37.490> we're
