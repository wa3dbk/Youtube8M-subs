stimulator device in 2013 will involve

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.130 
stimulator device in 2013 will involve
intense<00:02:46.860> clinical<00:02:47.400> trials<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.150> ensure<00:02:48.780> the

intense clinical trials to ensure the

safety and efficiency of the device the
four<00:02:52.950> years<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> our<00:02:53.489> proof<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.910> concept<00:02:54.260> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
four years is our proof of concept of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800 
four years is our proof of concept of
getting<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.769> device<00:02:56.070> developed<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.000> we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
getting a device developed and that we

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.770 
getting a device developed and that we
can<00:02:58.019> put<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.320> very<00:02:58.650> safely<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.730> easily<00:03:00.209> into<00:03:00.720> a

and<00:03:03.120> function<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.930> way<00:03:04.079> we<00:03:04.290> anticipate

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
and function the way we anticipate

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.830 
and function the way we anticipate
there's<00:03:05.549> general<00:03:05.880> excitement<00:03:06.600> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
there's general excitement and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.750 
there's general excitement and

anticipation that there will be

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.550 
anticipation that there will be
something<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.299> will<00:03:09.600> help<00:03:09.810> everyone

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
something that will help everyone

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.319 
something that will help everyone
realizes<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.640> not<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> be

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
realizes that it's not going to be

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.240 
realizes that it's not going to be
bringing<00:03:13.290> back<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.680> vision<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.220> had

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
bringing back the vision that they had

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.090 
bringing back the vision that they had
as<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:15.180> younger<00:03:15.480> person<00:03:15.600> but<00:03:16.590> also<00:03:16.769> they

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
as a younger person but also they

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.800 
as a younger person but also they
realize<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.489> lot<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.030> times<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.600> their

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
realize a lot of times that their

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.960 
realize a lot of times that their
disease<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.470> inherited<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.730> they're

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
disease is inherited and so they're

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.729 
disease is inherited and so they're
hopeful<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.660> maybe<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.260> doesn't<00:03:22.590> help

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
hopeful that maybe if it doesn't help

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.890 
hopeful that maybe if it doesn't help
them<00:03:22.980> necessarily<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.299> early<00:03:24.600> stages

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
them necessarily in the early stages

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.479 
them necessarily in the early stages
it'll<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.440> something<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.860> will<00:03:26.100> help<00:03:26.250> their

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it'll be something that will help their

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.640 
it'll be something that will help their
family<00:03:26.910> members<00:03:27.269> who<00:03:27.690> may<00:03:27.840> also<00:03:28.019> suffer<00:03:28.440> from

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
family members who may also suffer from

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.220 
family members who may also suffer from
this<00:03:28.860> disease<00:03:29.100> as<00:03:29.489> well<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.600> will<00:03:30.900> see<00:03:31.079> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
this disease as well just I will see the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.280 
this disease as well just I will see the
world<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.709> just<00:03:32.190> something<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.640> would<00:03:32.850> be

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
world is just something that would be

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.140 
world is just something that would be
really<00:03:34.290> special<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.340> two<00:03:35.459> people<00:03:35.910> that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
really special I think two people that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.840 
really special I think two people that
were<00:03:37.109> given<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> opportunity<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.489> bionic

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
were given the opportunity of a bionic

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:48.320 
were given the opportunity of a bionic
eye

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.420
