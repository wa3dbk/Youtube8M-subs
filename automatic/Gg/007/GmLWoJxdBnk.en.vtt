00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
hi we are talking about an exam paper

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.639 
hi we are talking about an exam paper
where<00:00:04.620> there<00:00:05.100> are<00:00:05.279> n<00:00:05.490> questions<00:00:06.290> for<00:00:07.290> J<00:00:07.529> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
where there are n questions for J is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.669 
where there are n questions for J is
equal<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:07.980> 1<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.490> N<00:00:08.760> there<00:00:09.540> are<00:00:09.719> 2<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> power

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
equal to 1 to N there are 2 to the power

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.999 
equal to 1 to N there are 2 to the power
of<00:00:10.740> n<00:00:11.130> minus<00:00:11.610> J<00:00:11.639> students<00:00:12.269> who<00:00:12.780> answered<00:00:12.929> J<00:00:13.830> or

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
of n minus J students who answered J or

more questions wrongly so first of all

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.990 
more questions wrongly so first of all
we<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.890> understand<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.699> does<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
we need to understand what does this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
we need to understand what does this
mean<00:00:18.289> this<00:00:19.289> means<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:20.310> 2<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> power<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.869> n

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
mean this means that 2 to the power of n

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.410 
mean this means that 2 to the power of n

students answered all the end questions
wrongly<00:00:46.140> well<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> 2<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> power<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.360> n

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
wrongly well that is 2 to the power of n

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.790 
wrongly well that is 2 to the power of n
minus<00:00:48.629> n<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.590> 2<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> power<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.879> 0<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.800> 1

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
minus n or 2 to the power of 0 or 1

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.720 
minus n or 2 to the power of 0 or 1
student<00:00:53.610> answered<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.449> questions<00:00:54.530> wrongly

student answered all questions wrongly

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
student answered all questions wrongly
so<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> total<00:00:58.020> number<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.500> wrong

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so what is the total number of wrong

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.990 
so what is the total number of wrong
answers<00:00:59.899> if<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.170> start<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.940> be

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
answers if we start from here it will be

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
answers if we start from here it will be
1<00:01:03.260> plus<00:01:04.260> 2<00:01:04.339> plus<00:01:05.339> 2<00:01:05.369> square<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.810> goes<00:01:07.080> on

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
1 plus 2 plus 2 square and this goes on

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.359 
1 plus 2 plus 2 square and this goes on
till<00:01:07.530> 2<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> power<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.850> n<00:01:09.090> minus<00:01:09.930> 1<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.799> how

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
till 2 to the power of n minus 1 and how

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.670 
till 2 to the power of n minus 1 and how
much<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
much is this well you can see the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
much is this well you can see the
pattern<00:01:14.100> 1<00:01:14.340> plus<00:01:14.549> 2<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.820> 3<00:01:14.850> 1<00:01:15.479> plus<00:01:15.689> 2<00:01:15.840> plus<00:01:16.049> 2

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
pattern 1 plus 2 is 3 1 plus 2 plus 2

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.080 
pattern 1 plus 2 is 3 1 plus 2 plus 2
square<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.770> 1<00:01:17.009> plus<00:01:17.220> 3<00:01:17.369> plus<00:01:17.430> 4<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.350> 3

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
square or 1 plus 3 plus 4 so this was 3

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
square or 1 plus 3 plus 4 so this was 3
then<00:01:21.090> 1<00:01:21.360> plus<00:01:21.600> 3<00:01:22.380> plus<00:01:22.650> 1<00:01:23.400> plus<00:01:23.520> 2<00:01:23.640> plus<00:01:23.850> 4<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.630> 7

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then 1 plus 3 plus 1 plus 2 plus 4 is 7

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.160 
then 1 plus 3 plus 1 plus 2 plus 4 is 7
the<00:01:26.310> next<00:01:26.460> value<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.420> include<00:01:27.600> 2

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the next value if you also include 2

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.100 
the next value if you also include 2
cube<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.960> will

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
cube in it what will that be that will

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.870 
cube in it what will that be that will
be<00:01:31.670> 7<00:01:32.670> plus<00:01:32.909> 8<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.540> 15<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.189> notice<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
be 7 plus 8 or 15 if you notice the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.740 
be 7 plus 8 or 15 if you notice the
pattern<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.630> leads<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> 2<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> power<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> n

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
pattern it leads to 2 to the power of n

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
pattern it leads to 2 to the power of n
minus<00:01:39.750> 1<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.770> 16<00:01:41.189> minus<00:01:41.640> 1

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
minus 1 this was 16 minus 1

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
minus 1 this was 16 minus 1
8<00:01:42.150> minus<00:01:42.750> 1<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.250> 4<00:01:44.250> minus<00:01:44.670> 1<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.750> 2<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
8 minus 1 and 4 minus 1 so 2 to the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.789 
8 minus 1 and 4 minus 1 so 2 to the
power<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.070> n<00:01:47.430> minus<00:01:48.030> 1<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.500> the
