00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.410
 in the most convenient place so as not to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 interfere with the arrangement of furniture on any 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.250
 should be installed outside such 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 premises in the intended wall location

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.260
 to the place of installation of the thermostat 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 it is necessary to supply power at the same time 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.829
 the cross section of the conductor of the power line should 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.539
 match the current strength of the heated floor 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.730
 preparation of the floor surface for installation 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.070
 to remove debris 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.500
 it is necessary to clean the room 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.589
 brush then need to produce 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 priming the floor to improve 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.020
 surface contact with cement-sand 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.030
 further marking is carried out 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.340
 places where the device floor heating 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 not required for example under the hospital 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.409
 real furniture and plumbing and so 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.119
 further besides it should be taken into account 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.950
 at least five indents from the wall 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.810
 centimeters and the fact that he 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 heating cable should be 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.729
 at a distance of at least 10 centimeters from 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.790
 other heating devices for example 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.650
 from risers and central heating pipes

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.280
 lay insulation on the surface 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.470
 floor if heat loss through the grounds 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.810
 minimum for example under the room 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.460
 It is heated the room 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.729
 laying insulating material 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.759
 small thickness of 3-4 millimeters can 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.470
 produce only on the heating area 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.540
 if the base is cold 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.950
 select the appropriate insulation 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.970
 thickness and strength 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.289
 to be laid over the entire floor space 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.750
 heat insulation fixing can 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.570
 produce any adhesive material not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 violate the integrity of the structure 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.350

 mounting tape in increments of 0 5 1 meter 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.120
 tape can be made 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.340
 in various ways providing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.620
 connection with the base for example using 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.110
 dowels and screws with condition 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.000

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.720
 heating sections 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.390
 before the installation of heating 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.130
 sections you need to figure out the stacking step with 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.230
 considering the final adjustment 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.489
 heated area it is calculated 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.980
 according to the formula 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.590
 permissible step deviation from the calculated 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.840
 no more than 10 millimeters styling 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.730
 starts with fitting end 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.000
 heating section to the site 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.400
 the location of the thermostat 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.019
 coupling and initial section 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 the heating section secure on the floor 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.410
 and from this place start the layout section 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.450
 cable should be laid evenly without 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.940
 crossing strictly observe constant 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.180
 laying step within the entire heated 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.820

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.910
 cable coils at a distance of less than eight 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.640
 centimeters fix the ends of the loops 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.830
 cable 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.950
 bending over him protruding reeds 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.319
 mounting tape bending loop must 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.830
 be smooth without kinks and tension 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.170
 cable 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.360
 the distance from the cable to the wall should 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.110
 be about five centimeters by 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 the entire perimeter of the heated area 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.350
 coupling and end sleeves sections 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.930
 must be on the floor 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.730
 mounting ends and heating section 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.310
 are output to the thermostat 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.200
 when laying single core sections 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.790
 abide by the same rules as 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.830
 two-core but when planning 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.840
 layouts should consider what to 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.050
 thermostat connect both 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.940
 mounting the end of the section to avoid 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.519
 mechanical damage to the heating 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.340
 sections and and installation should be carried out in 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.230
 shoes with soft elastic soles or 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.690
 cover the surface with the spread out 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.850

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.300
 other materials preventing 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.269
 mechanical damage installation and 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.470

 plastic corrugated tube 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.330
 the sensor must be located inside

 tube near its end of it 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.900
 connecting wire should go out with 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.690
 other end of the tube 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.700

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.700
 This sensor mounting method is used. 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.830
 in order to be able to 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.290
 need to replace the sensor is not 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.940

 heating section and sensor wires 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.940
 temperatures need to be sedated 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.430
 and connect to the thermostat check
