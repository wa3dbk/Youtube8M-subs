00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
to the end at a certain point I would

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.240 
to the end at a certain point I would
twist<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.940> ends<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.630> I'm<00:03:47.380> still<00:03:47.620> braiding<00:03:48.100> it

right now at about about at this point I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.630 
right now at about about at this point I
say<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.420> would<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.560> split<00:03:56.770> it<00:03:57.040> into<00:03:57.220> two

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
say I would just split it into two

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.300 
say I would just split it into two
sections<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.680> do<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.190> Swiss<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:01.510> helps<00:04:02.310> me
