because<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:48.970> thought<00:03:49.300> it<00:03:49.450> sounded<00:03:49.630> good<00:03:49.840> cuz

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
the less i found the less lacquer on a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.900 
the less i found the less lacquer on a
guitar<00:03:52.600> too<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.650> know<00:03:53.770> like<00:03:54.220> I'm<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.700> this

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
guitar too you know like I'm on this

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.450 
guitar too you know like I'm on this
when<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.600> guitar<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.200> guitar<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:57.340> an

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
when the guitar here you guitar just an

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.160 
when the guitar here you guitar just an
oil<00:03:57.670> finish<00:03:58.030> on<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.270> it's<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.540> best<00:03:58.750> way<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.960> do

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
oil finish on it it's the best way to do

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.130 
oil finish on it it's the best way to do
a<00:03:59.200> neck<00:04:00.390> also<00:04:01.390> you<00:04:01.540> know<00:04:01.630> you're<00:04:01.810> playing<00:04:01.990> on<00:04:02.050> a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
a neck also you know you're playing on a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.800 
a neck also you know you're playing on a
hot<00:04:02.320> day<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.950> get<00:04:03.280> sort<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:03.700> sweaty<00:04:04.030> you

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
hot day and you get sort of sweaty you

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.780 
hot day and you get sort of sweaty you
get<00:04:04.990> hung<00:04:05.140> up<00:04:05.290> on<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.710> and<00:04:05.740> instead<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.190> using<00:04:06.580> a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
get hung up on it and instead of using a

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.490 
get hung up on it and instead of using a
bunch<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.120> lubricant<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.960> know<00:04:08.080> which<00:04:08.290> can

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
bunch of lubricant you know which can

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.350 
bunch of lubricant you know which can
make<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:08.950> strings<00:04:09.220> go<00:04:09.430> bad<00:04:09.640> fast<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.240> know

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
make the strings go bad fast you know

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.020 
make the strings go bad fast you know
the<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.380> this<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.130> all<00:04:12.280> more<00:04:12.580> awful<00:04:12.940> and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
the the this is all more awful and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.750 
the the this is all more awful and
originally<00:04:13.390> wasn't<00:04:13.570> like<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:14.020> course<00:04:14.760> so

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
originally wasn't like that of course so

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.660 
originally wasn't like that of course so
I<00:04:16.120> find<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.650> better<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.799> make<00:04:18.100> guitars<00:04:18.340> with

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
I find it better to make guitars with

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.430 
I find it better to make guitars with
oil<00:04:18.910> finishes<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.510> stuff<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.750> actually<00:04:20.140> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
oil finishes and stuff and actually the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.170 
oil finishes and stuff and actually the
sound<00:04:20.739> of<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.100> body<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:21.580> guitar<00:04:21.670> sounds

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
sound of the body of the guitar sounds

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.880 
sound of the body of the guitar sounds
better<00:04:22.360> when<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.780> lacquer<00:04:23.290> starts<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.740> rub

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
better when the lacquer starts to rub

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.340 
better when the lacquer starts to rub
off<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.190> get<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.430> wood<00:04:24.670> sound<00:04:25.600> into<00:04:26.230> it

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
off you get the wood sound into it

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.280 
off you get the wood sound into it
