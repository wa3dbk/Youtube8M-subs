let's head over the PTC GL and see what

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.780 
let's head over the PTC GL and see what
these<00:04:45.229> four<00:04:45.530> codes<00:04:45.800> give<00:04:46.040> us<00:04:46.160> maybe<00:04:46.669> we'll

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
these four codes give us maybe we'll

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.930 
these four codes give us maybe we'll
find<00:04:47.060> something<00:04:47.330> decent<00:04:47.479> there<00:04:48.790> alright<00:04:49.790> so
