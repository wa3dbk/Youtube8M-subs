00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.050
 v 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.720
 hi to all it's didier moureu for a series of videos that will you 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.699
 allow to learn the basics of 10 million users the controller 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.560
 memory 33 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.849
 at first we'll see the basic functions like the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.720
 loading a song and how to play it 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.290
 then in a second step we will approach the technical aspect of the deejaying 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.800
 like synchronizing the playback speed of different tempo tracks 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.740
 this is called in the middle the gossip crap people finally we 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.120
 will tackle the artistic steppe of the deejaying dedicated to the discovery of 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 controller function that will allow us to evolve into simple 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.450
 staging tempo the hermit more creative 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.249
 I'm thinking of course about wearing meters of volume 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.800
 the equalizer profiles at the sumo point a loop and dare to do 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 I specify that the Mistral takes 3 must with his rakes and didier a little 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.600
 too much but you can if you want to evolve to the version 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.880
 paying didier cerrato 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.260
 in any case this video series will allow you to take in 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.030
 hand the controller but it will also require from your side if you learn to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.730
 take in hand the software cerrato with downloadable manuals on their 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.620
 site 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.540
 I wish you good luck in your learning and especially a museum 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 crowded 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.890
 m in this video we will first start by learning how to change 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.500
 of piece on each head then we'll see how to start playing a 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.230
 piece stop him and go back to his beginning 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.630
 and finally we will end with a reminder about the operating principle of 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.600
 fans hours and cancer 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.750
 to load a song on a pleyel there is a big navigation buttons 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.250
 pause that allows access to the playlists tab of its rakes 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.260
 the country what interests me is called loaded pieces so I do not select 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.890
 not highlighted 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.250
 to access the songs contained in the playlist just click on the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.210
 navigation button 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.530
 to go back to English selection playlists I must maintain 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.610
 the shale function and that I press the navigation button at the same time 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.130
 to load a piece 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 I go back to my playlist and highlight it 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.969
 for example I will change the piece of the basic health loop on the 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.269
 country in two using the button aude 2 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.689
 and the battery loop on the payer 1 using the button aude 1 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.819
 loading a piece 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.269
 we find that its rakes place the playback cursor directly on the 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.339
 first beat 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.320
 Therefore 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.700
 when you press the play button the song is played 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 instantly to stop playback of the song just press 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.219
 again on the play button 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.299
 to go back to the beginning of the piece we have to maintain the shale function is 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.039
 pressed at the same time on the psion button 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.309
 you can also start a temporary reading by pressing and holding 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:53.469
 the options button however I think it is released reading it breathes 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.709
 the cursor returns to the beginning of the song 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.179
 if we use the point of killing or default 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.989
 to start playing the song 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.569
 so you have to think also press the play button before releasing it 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.069
 ap 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.089
 6 that 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.679
 volume factors certainly to go up it lower the sound level of each 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:11.399
 customer 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.879
 when I climbed down in favor of two sectors we hear that I 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.589
 went down the volume of the pieces that are affected ie my 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.979
 Beatrice Loop and Low Density Loop x 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.269
 the large horizontal stadium serves as a bridge between the two countries of Europe and close 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.339
 therefore isolate or mix them when the carrier is placed at 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.239
 the left end we hear only their left customers in our case 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.029
 it's the cliffs battery loop when the big stadium then moved 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.419
 at the right end it is necessary to understand that the client on the right, ie 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.209
 labatt center 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.379
 when the big stadium of europe is placed in the center we hear the two 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.829
 better ie the health of the batteries 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.839
 I'm afraid turns out to make a transition to more noise level or 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.809
 less progressive between the two complainants depending on the setting of his 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.040
 race that can be changed in the set-up menu of its rakes too much 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.499
 a long race setting on Saturday a gradual transition of sound level 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.389
 between the two countries so we can go smoothly from my loop of 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.679
 Patrick tells me to wait only with the help of the big stadium 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.769
 on the other hand with this setting it is impossible to discover meters 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.160
 what is called head is not possible to decide with the settings 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.949
 long running 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.669
 on the other hand racing settings at the shortest allow a directive transition 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.639
 sound level since the port of the great larval stage of prayer I 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.139
 therefore advocates this setting in order to keep the possibility of doing 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.430
 cuts meters and scratch if necessary 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.310
 it will still be possible to make very gradual volume transitions 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.710
 by placing the pau-center gold kansas and modulating the sound levels of 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.710
 each piece with dedicated volume creators 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.289
