00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.369
 man because i went to hema's house 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 simply to Toulouse I wanted 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.670

 Toulouse is not long ago so it's 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.109
 so I will introduce you to 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.290
 products I will put you the price on 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.350
 the side of one of the two sides I do not know 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.690
 since I think it's not great 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.530
 always take the ticket get the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.570
 syriza clement after then I start 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.910
 so first of all we'll start with this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.700
 that I preferred to take so I took 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.250
 this if it's a big bomb jar have 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.020
 so are old benches which he is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.770
 huge I think kind of have some really 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.859
 for a very long time 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.590
 except that ben I cracked a long time 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.570
 candy and then I like the box 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.020
 it's the professional drummer she's giving me 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 will serve after why not be good 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.390
 so that's after I bought two 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.310
 candles 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 so I took a gray and a pink 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 you'll tell me but it's not right with 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.009
 the shellfish era with you all 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.920
 simply because a july I'm going 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 do my pope called that works 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.049
 but I will remove the wallpaper and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.759
 paint in white here and there is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.310
 some things that will change and I 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.900
 will make my decor in gray and cream I 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.430
 therefore believe that there is no cream 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.049
 I took a rose but it's going very well 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.590
 and then I went to a party 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.420
 so like that why just son 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.100
 that not long ago I broke 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.070
 my umbrella that were in my bag 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.450
 in hand and it's really that kind of 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.950
 umbrellas that I take when I have not 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.479
 expected it will rain otherwise I have one 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:07.090
 big than a lot more solid team 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:08.879
 much prettier too then I 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.830
 bought a little makeup brushes 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.560
 So here it is to redo the features 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.720
 ends under racing this stuff 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.579
 that I really did not have any pure 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.840
 the eyeliner I really had no 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.090
 little brushes like that I'm in 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 to take care of taking the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.010
 brushes and complete my collection 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.660
 little by little so I did not invite myself 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:36.670
 really cheap and I'm going to test it 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:38.140
 here I have also taken glue pens 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.090
 I think for the activities 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.549
 manual is much more accurate is 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.700
 much simpler and as I like 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:50.459
 to do well I cracked on it I 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 then taken 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.880
 I then took two things 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
 of labels the trick of tic is beautiful he 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.959
 is more than the labels is of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.950
 stickers with labels 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.599
 besides I 'll have them we 'll watch 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.989
 exactly five hundred started to 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.989
 interior 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.989
 so it's very simple labels 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.870
 so like that and like that and I have 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.370
 took two simply because I 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.870
 soon offered finally if you were I'm going 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.609
 back to school and that's fine 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.690
 serve among other things for that for everything 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.690
 who is cost immunization 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:34.500
 I bought then I bought some cds 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.209
 the tt simply skeptics paper 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.180
 our childhood canvases with 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.840
 simple found that super cute and and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.129
 that's the same style I took it 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.250
 so this is an annotated notebook so in 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.719
 there is simply there is everything 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.400
 just small sticks post-it 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:01.200
 so there are little ones any end 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.950
 to make a little mark pages next 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.389
 the ja to do to day so what is to 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.169
 do today and then that I 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.329
 found super cute so here I did 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:18.660
 jump on it and for the decoration it can 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:20.940
 be good then nothing at the top level 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.479
 destiny I took that so that's 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.789
 nice or sign one gets organized and so you 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:32.220
 will surely see them in the back to 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:35.610
 school that I will do I also took some 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.979
 blow a little notebook like this for for 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.190
 note so this one will surely 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:44.210
 to rate my videos to prepare the 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.669
 trams and so on I found super cute 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.919
 and suddenly they were not very expensive I 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:55.590
 the prices I also bought so these 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.909
 two little things there so at home 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.500
 think when you were little you in 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.870
 had had so we put the sheet have it 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.300
 supported by the blow there is the shape of the cac on 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.009
 the on the end here so the cedh story 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.819
 clouds cat paw and teams 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:14.979
 if they go out I also took some 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.809
 voice there felt pens I find that 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.180
 really cool it's really handy 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.889
 and it was really cheap in 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.949
 supermarkets right now we find them 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.229
 to 14.15 euros while there is two 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.259
 fifty euros and it was well worth the 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.259
 stroke 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:33.909
 I also took the mussels 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.319
 cubic ice cubes 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.360
 so I'm going with serve to make 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.089
 fresh ice cubes it's just that 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.710
 in general with green tea 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:45.249
 when I'm really tired 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.589
 aftermath of evenings with I take 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.779
 green tea I did dive into this fact 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:51.550
 green tea ice with the coup of 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.680
 toothpicks that I like inside 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.809
 to go after and I pass them 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.279
 under the eyes it decongests her 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:03.370
 fresh and and it's really great and I 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:05.229
 was fed up every time to have my 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.309
 super hard or limited ice cube tray 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.020
 I was removing all 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.649
 ice cubes at the same time I hit 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.909
 found it was super cool I also 

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:17.469
 bought a hole here 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.809
 because we all need a 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.209
 punch and I had more for me 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:25.749
 our step and then I took a big 

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:29.499
 titles like that so he has two so 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:30.639
 it's sheets of this pack banking and 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.519
 there really are a lot 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.879
 not if you see even aberrant a lot 

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:38.740
 a lot 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:40.059
 and suddenly it is with all all 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.229
 the drawings that art will find them 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:47.229
 inside in several a payer 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.220
 leaves so it's really top and I 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.310
 do not know how much 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.270
 screams yes written in kilos and I do not know 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:58.420
 how much is two sheets 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:07:00.220
 in the end here and so that's all 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.360
