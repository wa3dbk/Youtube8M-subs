00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Round bell 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.260
 Hello! Hello everyone, today we are going to teach "round bells" 

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:11.074
 "Circular Bell" Let's demonstrate it once! 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.400
 The round bell is a very comfortable bell, let's learn it together! 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.280
 In the beginning, we watched the slow motion 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.560
 At the beginning of this action, it can be inside or outside. 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.300
 It will lift the bell like a circular track 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.300
呜~~~~~ 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.513
 Fly down 

00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:42.380
 Hey~~ 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.329
 Fly up again 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.100
 Maintain a round look, you see our teacher, Qiming, are about to fall asleep! 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 Let's introduce the basic part of the work. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.320
 The basic part of the work, it only needs a "round ringing" and it is very skilled to practice this action. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.960
 And usually after the round bell is very skilled, the round bell will soon linger! 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.520
 Decomposition teaching 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.720
 In the beginning: Let's go back and review the round bell ringing. How familiar should the round bell ring be? It’s like this. 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.240
 Our bells can be pressed as far as possible to the left. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.240
 When flying on the left, let the bell fall near the point where our right hand is 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.020
 Every time you can maintain this, it is thrown on the left, it is dropped on the right side, and people can stand still! 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.480
 If you are skilled! You can directly practice the round bell! 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.460
 Start with an inner winding, the action we have to do is almost exactly the same! 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.080
 Press the bell from the right to the left, and when you are near the left, throw the bell up. 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:01.100
 When you throw it up: both hands should try to lean in, let our line be loose, let the bell fly in the air like a free bird. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.720
 When the bell flies near the right hand side, the hand slowly pulls open. 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 I returned to the feeling of just throwing the bell. After going to the right hand, press it to the left and continue to make the next round of ringing. 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 But now it is already a circular bell. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.820
 After practicing, you will find: "Oh~ God! I have learned it!" Congratulations, you have learned! 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.160
 If the round bell is cooked, consider practicing it: a special touch that mixes a round bell and a round bell. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 Wait a minute, we will explain it to you in slow motion. 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.440
 I started with a "round bell" and decided to do a "round bell". 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 When the bell falls, use your left hand to circle the bell and continue to make a circular bell. 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.057
 When you want to unlock 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.540
 Let the bell fly over the stick of the right hand, and after falling from the outside, it will return to the empty bell, and you can make a round bell. 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.360
 By maintaining this state, you can unwind and rewind at any time. 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.020
 This practice is ripe, this class is here! 

00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:14.814
 Common mistakes 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
 Introduce two common mistakes 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.540
 The first one is that "Pei Bell" will be brushed when doing a circular bell! 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.940
 That brushing sound is actually a slowdown! Don't make it louder because the brush sounds very pleasant! This is the wrong performance! 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.980
 Second: the direction is reversed. Some students will feel that they feel like they have a round shape. 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.440
 In fact, if the direction is wrong, the situation like this is completely unaccelerated! 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.940
 Demonstration of fixed axis 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.160
 The principle of fixing the shaft is exactly the same as that of the bell, but the shaft should be more careful. When the bell is in the air, the line cannot be pulled too tight. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.360
 Otherwise the speed of the bell can easily be eaten. Probably like this, come on! Class! Bye bye!
