of<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.190> companion<00:00:05.549> video<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.390> landslide

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
of a companion video for the landslide

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.960 
of a companion video for the landslide
because<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.830> uses<00:00:08.010> exactly<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.730> same

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
because it uses exactly the same

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.839 
because it uses exactly the same
fingering<00:00:09.660> pan<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.860> go<00:00:10.980> together<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
fingering pan so we go together the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.620 
fingering pan so we go together the
first<00:00:12.090> chord<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.420> f<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> sea<00:00:13.650> bass<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.630> we

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
play together one two three one two and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
play together one two three one two and
they're<00:01:00.449> G<00:01:00.829> again<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> play

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
they're G again we don't have to play

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.579 
they're G again we don't have to play
like<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> regular<00:01:03.090> G<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.899> any<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> kind<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
like a regular G or any of this kind of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.380 
like a regular G or any of this kind of
stuff<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.220> use<00:01:05.339> our<00:01:05.489> third<00:01:05.729> finger

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.800 

say<00:01:11.600> together<00:01:12.600> 1<00:01:13.110> 2<00:01:13.140> 3<00:01:13.980> 1<00:01:14.370> 2<00:01:14.400> together<00:01:14.970> 1<00:01:15.780> 2

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
say together 1 2 3 1 2 together 1 2

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.070 
say together 1 2 3 1 2 together 1 2
phase<00:01:16.470> 3<00:01:16.500> 1<00:01:17.130> 2<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> regular<00:01:18.510> minor

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
phase 3 1 2 and then a regular minor

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.380 
phase 3 1 2 and then a regular minor
capers<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> 4th<00:01:22.530> fret<00:01:22.800> by<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.040> way

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.690 

so<00:01:26.990> those<00:01:27.170> three<00:01:27.620> cords<00:01:27.980> run<00:01:28.160> into<00:01:28.400> each<00:01:28.520> other

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
so those three cords run into each other

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.180 
so those three cords run into each other
so<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.850> get<00:01:29.000> F<00:01:30.370> G

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
so you get F G

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.660 
so you get F G
a<00:01:32.840> minor<00:01:34.850> G

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
a minor G

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.070 
a minor G
right<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:39.080> does<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:40.790> run<00:01:41.450> four<00:01:41.900> times

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
right it does that that run four times

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.260 
right it does that that run four times
in<00:01:42.409> each<00:01:42.500> row<00:01:42.740> twelve<00:01:43.250> times<00:01:43.549> according<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:44.090> my

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
in each row twelve times according to my

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.510 
in each row twelve times according to my
chart<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:44.680> for<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.740> verse<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.280> in<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
chart here for the verse and in the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.600 
chart here for the verse and in the
pre-chorus<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:47.360> get<00:01:47.570> F<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:49.270> minor

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.070 

gee<00:01:54.140> now<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> pen<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:57.000> almost<00:01:57.510> exactly<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
gee now the pen is almost exactly the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.640 
gee now the pen is almost exactly the
same<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> minor<00:01:59.160> together<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
same over the a minor together one to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.510 
same over the a minor together one to
base

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.710 

okay<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.869> goes<00:02:06.049> together<00:02:06.310> one<00:02:07.310> two<00:02:07.970> nice

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
okay so that goes together one two nice

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.590 
okay so that goes together one two nice
three

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
three

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.770 
three
to<00:02:11.200> pull<00:02:11.500> off<00:02:11.650> from<00:02:12.370> sea

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:24.010 

to<00:02:15.780> be

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:34.760 

so<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.170> sounds<00:02:25.470> like

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:58.539 

I'm<00:02:35.770> on
