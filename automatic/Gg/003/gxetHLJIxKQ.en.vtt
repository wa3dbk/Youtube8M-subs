00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:13.259
 good here is the mick bringing mistreated is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.740
 a survival game plus one is ne 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.660
 This one is in the open world. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 footprint has not been half since and we have a few 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.609
 infected mutants or something I do not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.580
 I know I know I'm not a zombie is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.460
 I did not really see many scattered 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 the map and faced some died are 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.590
 very difficult to kill 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.969
 are people I do not know right monthly allowance 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 right what it is 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.829
 I know I really liked the graphics on the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.920
 game I'm seeing the visual environment is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.610
 very very beautiful the character tÃ¡ 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 half coarse do not join in alpha in that 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 early access to steam does not 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.570
 those who still wanted 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.850
 drive and a cool curiosity 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.430
 that the visuals of the environment are 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.470
 Seeing are pretty well done. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 the construction of the game is being done 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 with the crytek cry engine is the same 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 engine of crises is an open world made 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.400
 with the sensational graphics of that engine 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.259
 crytek 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.310
 and so I quite liked the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.960
 ambiance 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 I played a little in the third person 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.320
 here is this video I'm recording 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.329
 after playing is like i did not know 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.000
 right what to expect from the game I recorded 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.799
 without audio is without any narration and now 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.520
 I'm doing a brief review here 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:47.549
 had the game 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:51.110
 the environments are very wide and so the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.110
 map itself is not so great yet, but more 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.090
 his construction is so well done that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.780
 it looks like it's bigger than it is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.369
 it's very cool the textures of 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.369
 vegetation to water lighting then 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.369
 sensational 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.790
 who has a map and get an idea more or 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.829
 less than the size of the map for now 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.819
 not everything is accessible do you have 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:30.200
 You can see there is a city above 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.810
 That's where we're going, it 's a city. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.730
 but it also has other cities 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:42.069
 neighboring countries and the exploitation is very 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:47.079
 already dimming a little of the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:50.359
 vegetation lighting is very nice 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.220
 The game is not heavy 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.840
 despite using the engine of the crisis, right? 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.010
 the textures are a little bit 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.049
 seasons right to Estamo south heaven the 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.579
 textures are not totally in full 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:10.220
 as the right cras but is to be expected I 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.849
 open game with such a great would not give 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.220
 to use the maximum textures without affecting 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.220
 performance gives one more is better ne 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.389
 this server had some people right 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.190
 playing and so you stay in that 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.209
 apprehension in this one does not know if 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.959
 find someone in any corner is 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.790
 well- constructed so the setting of 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:44.269
 cause it's something I always feel 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:48.530
 much lack is is dirty environments and cars 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:54.229
 destroyed until then but I do not know yet 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:58.099
 finds everything very clean and difficult to find 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:04:02.150
 evil in the game saw is to develop are 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:06.199
 quite difficult to use weapons but 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.699
 has points of kings stage that if you 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:11.000
 find out where it is you will always 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:13.729
 finding the game is fine even in the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.190
 beginning is was released I think in October 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:22.040
 2014 and so has a lot of bug 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.260
 failures still the servers not so full 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.200
 if it is difficult to find a server with 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.890
 enough people playing the servers for 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.120
 while it has up to 32 people, right? 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.450
 I do not know what the plans are. 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.270
 developed and increase the hatchet 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:47.750
 It's incredible, I think it's the hatchet. 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:49.430
 When I go to see the terror is this not 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.840
 liked the video since its like 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.610
 subscribe to the channel to stay inside 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.610
 the novelties such
