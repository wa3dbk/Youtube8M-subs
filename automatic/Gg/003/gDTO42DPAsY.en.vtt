 favorite fiction whether good or bad I 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.490
 I really consider houses as a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.490
 leader because she kind of knew how 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.850
 Your parents are your favorite description 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.859

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.310
 garden the advantages of being invisible and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.840
 also the brownies because not possessed to 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.100
 a name of a book in which water 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.750
 is fundamental either in the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.600
 establishment or the argument this 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.610
 book I have not read it yet but I know it is 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.229
 jackson and the evil of monsters 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.789
 the water appeared mentally 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.099
 dionicio with what character you would like 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.539

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.819
 of my passion 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.549
 catherine's because it's really been 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.310
 the first character that has taken me a 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.369
 laugh but potent powerful thing the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.319
 carcajá ships apollo name in the book 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.269

 art I do not know who is 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.010
 feminine favorite I think without a doubt 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.930
 he made the book thief all over 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.580
 what he taught to every person who 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 crossed in his path to always contribute 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.420
 something in the lives of others and I believe 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.299
 that is something of total admiration and if 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.989
 I love you so much is assigned number of 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.900
 a character that is wise 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.930
 the uncle is with the 'uncle paco' is the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.599
 wisest person you can imagine 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.489

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.140
 hermes if you could see any 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.910
 fictional scenario real world or of 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.299
 fantasy where days 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.770
 I think I would go to the city of stars 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.010
 because I feel like it's like all 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.530
 modern and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.409
 and in father in the city ares what is your 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.510
 favorite fictional battle is that the 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.659
 battles is not like that my forte is , 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.450
 I really do not like the battle 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.519
 but I think that this battle was the one that 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.799
 I liked it more because it was not the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.900
 typical battle of Miami to nothing but that 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.480
 like they were doing strategies to avoid 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.540
 character fell into such a trap then 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.310
 the battle of these effects and you could 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.010
 have any tool description 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.140
 a weapon a gadget you'd like 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.360
 you have a magic wand and so 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.550
 and now I feel wonders for life 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.110
 Afrodita What is your ideal partner the 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.610
 characters do not have to be the same 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.560
 book 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.690
 Well, fortunately, this couple 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.260
 will be inside the same book and I 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.170
 rudy and I think that is eliseu are eggs 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.760
 do not become boyfriends but if they are 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.010
 best friends and I think that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.290
 relationship is the most important thing that a 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.030
 human being is going to have in their life them 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.560
 they are like a couple of best friends 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.540
 I think it's friendship more 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.240
 strong that I have seen in all the years 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.370
 I've read the English rudy if 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.740
 you could ask to distract any 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.920
 fictional character among the dead to 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.070
 who would you choose 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.730
 because this is an expolio of the lagoon 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.730
 10- second advance books I do not know 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.730
 but 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.099
 when I rolled and left here I 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.809
 I really did not know what to do with my life 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.959
 everything was over 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:39.539
 bruni last question if it could be a 

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:41.729
 god or goddess of nothing who would like to be 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.639
 and what do you think it would be you would adapt in 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.819
 Your personality I would like to make 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.860
 poseidon because I would like to have a 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.610
 beach that in my room as if it were 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.159
