got<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> rechargeable<00:01:09.299> battery<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.049> can

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
got a rechargeable battery so you can

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
got a rechargeable battery so you can
just<00:01:10.500> recharge<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.490> 10<00:01:11.729> hours<00:01:12.000> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
just recharge it once they 10 hours is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
just recharge it once they 10 hours is
run<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.750> battery<00:01:13.680> life<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.460> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
run out of battery life there so just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.920 
run out of battery life there so just
really<00:01:14.790> charge<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.270> good<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> go

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
really charge it up good to go

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
really charge it up good to go
and<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.590> written<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.430> different

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

and it's just written in different
languages<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.780> from

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
languages as well so if you from

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:19.880 
languages as well so if you from
different<00:01:19.170> country<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
different country they have to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.469 
different country they have to
understand<00:01:20.280> everything<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.000> I've<00:01:21.270> stated

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
understand everything that I've stated

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.109 
understand everything that I've stated
on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:22.130> back<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> need

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
on the back back of it there so I need

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.340 
on the back back of it there so I need
to<00:01:24.330> tell<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> product<00:01:24.960> color<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
to tell them the product color there so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
to tell them the product color there so
it's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> black<00:01:25.770> version<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.400> we'll<00:01:26.580> actually

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it's a black version so we'll actually

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
it's a black version so we'll actually
get<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> closer<00:01:27.299> look<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> second<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.140> just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
get a closer look in a second I just

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649
