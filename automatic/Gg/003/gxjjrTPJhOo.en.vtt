to start with then the next thing I'll

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.420 
to start with then the next thing I'll
need<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.260> along<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.980> groove

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
need to do is that along this groove

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.130 
need to do is that along this groove
right<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:28.320> duck<00:00:29.220> glue<00:00:29.730> dirt<00:00:30.390> debris

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
right here is a duck glue dirt debris

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
right here is a duck glue dirt debris
it'll<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> chisel<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it'll have to chisel out so that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
it'll have to chisel out so that
everything<00:00:33.510> fits<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.079> flush<00:00:34.350> once<00:00:34.530> I've

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
everything fits really flush once I've

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
everything fits really flush once I've
got<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> done<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> plan<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
got it done so the plan with this is to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
got it done so the plan with this is to
shave<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:40.340> install<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
shave all these off and then install it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.720 
shave all these off and then install it
and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> think<00:00:43.050> we're<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.610> sand<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and then I think we're going to sand it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
and then I think we're going to sand it
and<00:00:44.789> finish<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.960> may<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.500> run<00:00:46.620> this

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and finish it but I may just run this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
and finish it but I may just run this
through<00:00:46.980> run<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.370> pieces<00:00:47.640> through<00:00:48.000> plana

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
through run these pieces through plana

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
through run these pieces through plana
and<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.710> top<00:00:49.890> layer<00:00:50.070> off<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.460> don't

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and take this top layer off so we don't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
and take this top layer off so we don't
have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> sand<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.590> haven't<00:00:52.739> really

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
have to sand it so we haven't really

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.200 
have to sand it so we haven't really
figured<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> part<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.579> yet<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.969> wanted

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
figured that part out yet but I wanted

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
figured that part out yet but I wanted
to<00:00:54.300> show<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to show you you know this is kind of my

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
to show you you know this is kind of my
goal<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.670> share<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.149> other<00:00:57.690> people<00:00:57.809> how

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
goal is to share with other people how

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
goal is to share with other people how
to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.680> certain<00:00:59.039> things<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.550> marques<00:00:59.910> been<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to do certain things and marques been a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.930 
to do certain things and marques been a
huge<00:01:00.480> resource<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.399> could<00:01:02.609> pull

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
huge resource for me so you could pull

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
huge resource for me so you could pull
these<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.300> um<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:04.589> staple<00:01:04.860> goes<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.519> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
these out um this staple goes into this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.760 
these out um this staple goes into this
edge<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> hard<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> pull<00:01:07.619> them

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
edge so it's kind of hard to pull them

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
edge so it's kind of hard to pull them
out<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.810> set<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.979> router

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
out so what we have set up is a router

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210
