00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
we're gonna demonstrate to you the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.749 
we're gonna demonstrate to you the
spiral<00:00:23.810> rock<00:00:23.990> we<00:00:24.710> use<00:00:24.890> this<00:00:25.009> exercise<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.520> lot

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
spiral rock we use this exercise a lot

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.580 
spiral rock we use this exercise a lot
to<00:00:25.939> develop<00:00:26.060> core<00:00:26.630> strength<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.140> full<00:00:27.410> range

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
to develop core strength to a full range

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.370 
to develop core strength to a full range
of<00:00:27.680> motion<00:00:27.829> as<00:00:28.520> well<00:00:28.820> as<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.180> restore<00:00:29.869> mobility

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
of motion as well as to restore mobility

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.439 
of motion as well as to restore mobility
to<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.650> spine<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.880> Ryan's<00:00:32.239> going<00:00:32.390> to

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
to the spine so Ryan's going to

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.210 
to the spine so Ryan's going to
demonstrate<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.930> exercise<00:00:33.350> we'll<00:00:33.980> start

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
demonstrate the exercise we'll start

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.970 
demonstrate the exercise we'll start
with<00:00:34.400> a<00:00:34.430> regression<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.290> first<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:36.769> he's

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
with a regression so the first is he's

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.840 
with a regression so the first is he's
gonna<00:00:37.070> slowly<00:00:37.610> lower<00:00:38.210> back<00:00:38.540> as<00:00:38.839> he<00:00:39.559> exhales

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
gonna slowly lower back as he exhales

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.000 
gonna slowly lower back as he exhales
one<00:00:40.850> vertebrae<00:00:41.480> at<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.660> time<00:00:41.690> avoid<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.769> flat

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
one vertebrae at a time avoid the flat

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.700 
one vertebrae at a time avoid the flat
back<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.550> don't<00:00:43.730> want<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.120> mat<00:00:44.330> okay<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.410> one

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
back you don't want the mat okay so one

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.529 
back you don't want the mat okay so one
vertebrae<00:00:46.219> at<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.370> time<00:00:46.399> as<00:00:46.850> he<00:00:47.120> goes<00:00:47.239> all<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
vertebrae at a time as he goes all the

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.220 
vertebrae at a time as he goes all the
way<00:00:47.690> down<00:00:48.190> shoulders<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.340> head<00:00:49.460> come<00:00:49.730> down

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
way down shoulders and head come down

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.260 
way down shoulders and head come down
then<00:00:51.230> he's<00:00:51.410> gonna<00:00:51.530> inhale<00:00:51.920> as<00:00:52.730> he<00:00:52.879> comes<00:00:53.090> back

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
then he's gonna inhale as he comes back

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.319 
then he's gonna inhale as he comes back
comes<00:00:54.050> back<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.469> starting<00:00:54.770> position<00:00:55.329> back

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
comes back to the starting position back

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.100 
comes back to the starting position back
is<00:00:56.539> straight

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
is straight

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.010 
is straight
okay<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.460> work<00:00:58.670> on<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:58.969> exercise<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.899> then

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
okay so work on that exercise and then

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.840 
okay so work on that exercise and then
we'll<00:01:00.140> go<00:01:00.230> into<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.559> full<00:01:00.739> spiral<00:01:01.250> rock<00:01:01.430> so

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
we'll go into the full spiral rock so

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.359 
we'll go into the full spiral rock so
again<00:01:02.149> you'll<00:01:02.750> see<00:01:02.899> Ryan<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.379> exhale<00:01:03.829> as<00:01:04.190> he

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
again you'll see Ryan on exhale as he

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.359 
again you'll see Ryan on exhale as he
rolls<00:01:04.879> back<00:01:05.410> this<00:01:06.410> time<00:01:06.590> he's<00:01:06.740> gonna<00:01:06.800> elevate

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
rolls back this time he's gonna elevate

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.840 
rolls back this time he's gonna elevate
his<00:01:07.520> hips<00:01:07.759> okay<00:01:08.149> so<00:01:09.280> weight<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.550> on<00:01:10.700> his

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
his hips okay so weight is on his

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.560 
his hips okay so weight is on his
shoulders<00:01:10.880> not<00:01:11.690> on<00:01:11.899> his<00:01:12.080> neck<00:01:12.289> or<00:01:12.470> his<00:01:12.530> head

his<00:01:14.570> hips<00:01:14.960> are<00:01:15.110> elevated<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:15.860> he's<00:01:16.009> not

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
his hips are elevated so he's not

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.710 
his hips are elevated so he's not
kicking<00:01:16.429> his<00:01:16.700> legs<00:01:16.940> up<00:01:17.149> in<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.360> air<00:01:17.450> but<00:01:17.600> he's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
kicking his legs up in the air but he's

when you uncoil and come up big inhale
right<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:28.880> chest<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.420> up<00:01:29.600> head<00:01:29.930> is<00:01:30.079> up<00:01:30.290> and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
right here chest is up head is up and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.520 
right here chest is up head is up and
then<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.220> goes<00:01:31.340> back<00:01:31.579> for<00:01:31.820> another<00:01:32.060> room

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
then it goes back for another room

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.350 
then it goes back for another room
another<00:01:33.530> coaching<00:01:33.799> cube<00:01:34.189> we<00:01:34.340> use<00:01:34.520> here<00:01:34.759> is

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
another coaching cube we use here is

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.359 
another coaching cube we use here is
when<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.689> go<00:01:35.840> back<00:01:35.869> he's<00:01:36.770> gonna<00:01:36.950> kick<00:01:37.220> his

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
when you go back he's gonna kick his

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.179 
when you go back he's gonna kick his
knees<00:01:37.759> up<00:01:38.479> onto<00:01:38.750> my<00:01:38.840> arm<00:01:39.110> as<00:01:39.710> if<00:01:39.950> he's<00:01:40.070> gonna

hang from a bar okay so shoulders hips
and<00:01:43.610> knees<00:01:44.180> are<00:01:44.450> gonna<00:01:44.600> be<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:44.810> one<00:01:45.020> line<00:01:45.229> at

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
and knees are gonna be in one line at

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.200 
and knees are gonna be in one line at
the<00:01:45.530> top<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.950> movement<00:01:46.159> okay<00:01:46.549> no<00:01:46.729> leg<00:01:46.970> kick

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the top of the movement okay no leg kick

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.719 
the top of the movement okay no leg kick
at<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.420> top<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.259> remember<00:01:49.070> don't<00:01:49.250> slap<00:01:49.549> your
