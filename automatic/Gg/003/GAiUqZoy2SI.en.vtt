too easy to see through them I think

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.000 
too easy to see through them I think
that<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> Internet<00:03:11.109> has<00:03:11.260> done<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.500> lot<00:03:11.799> to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.360 
connection between consumer and producer
is<00:03:19.480> now<00:03:19.630> direct<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.319> makes<00:03:20.530> both<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.069> those

is now direct and it makes both of those
people<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.819> lot<00:03:22.030> more<00:03:22.239> powerful<00:03:22.599> until<00:03:23.440> very

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
people a lot more powerful until very

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.309 
people a lot more powerful until very
recently<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.669> seller<00:03:25.450> always<00:03:25.780> had<00:03:26.109> more

closing<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.959> what<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.500> think<00:04:17.680> are<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.799> new<00:04:17.980> ABCs

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
closing to what I think are the new ABCs

which are attunement buoyancy and

which are attunement buoyancy and
clarity<00:04:20.850> attunement<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:21.940> about<00:04:22.180> seeing<00:04:22.510> the

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
one that looks like this I'm taking my

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.529 
one that looks like this I'm taking my

perspective the C I'm writing it so you

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.969 
perspective the C I'm writing it so you
can<00:05:31.720> see<00:05:31.870> it<00:05:31.960> I'm<00:05:32.050> taking<00:05:32.139> your<00:05:32.410> perspective

one<00:05:33.669> of<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.789> keys<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.060> persuading

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
one of the keys to persuading

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.050 
one of the keys to persuading
influencing<00:05:34.960> selling<00:05:35.800> other<00:05:35.950> people<00:05:36.370> is<00:05:36.850> to

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
influencing selling other people is to

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.879 
influencing selling other people is to
see<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.360> world<00:05:37.389> from<00:05:37.720> their<00:05:38.080> perspective<00:05:38.110> and

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
see the world from their perspective and

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.129 
see the world from their perspective and
so<00:05:39.340> if<00:05:39.729> you<00:05:39.970> do<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.270> test<00:05:40.570> and<00:05:40.840> you're<00:05:40.960> always

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
so if you do this test and you're always

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.110 
so if you do this test and you're always
going<00:05:41.440> like<00:05:41.560> this<00:05:41.830> you're<00:05:42.729> going<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:42.970> have<00:05:43.090> a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
going like this you're going to have a

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.750 
going like this you're going to have a
problem<00:05:43.360> persuading<00:05:43.960> people<00:05:44.070> for<00:05:45.070> me<00:05:45.280> the

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
problem persuading people for me the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.390 
problem persuading people for me the
exercises<00:05:46.450> are<00:05:46.630> integral<00:05:47.289> because<00:05:47.830> I<00:05:48.010> want

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
exercises are integral because I want

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.890 
exercises are integral because I want
this<00:05:48.729> book<00:05:49.030> to<00:05:49.539> translate<00:05:49.840> into<00:05:50.229> action

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.170 

I'm<00:05:53.900> thrilled<00:05:54.440> that<00:05:54.590> he<00:05:54.830> wrote<00:05:55.010> this<00:05:55.250> book<00:05:55.490> it

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
I'm thrilled that he wrote this book it

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.720 
I'm thrilled that he wrote this book it
isn't<00:05:56.660> just<00:05:56.810> about<00:05:57.020> selling<00:05:57.650> he's<00:05:58.220> teaching

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
isn't just about selling he's teaching
