other<00:01:24.479> pieces<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.259> are<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:27.259> just<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.409> two

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

other pieces that are I just have two
clips<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:31.110> there's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.409> few<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.220> are

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
clips and then there's a few that are

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.800 
clips and then there's a few that are
just<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.570> one-inch<00:01:34.320> clips<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.479> section

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
just these one-inch clips so the section

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
just these one-inch clips so the section
that<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.380> using<00:01:37.740> today<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that I'm going to be using today is this

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.340 
that I'm going to be using today is this
big<00:01:38.880> section<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.840> saves<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.200> lot<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
big section and it just saves a lot of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
big section and it just saves a lot of
time<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> clips<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:43.049> small<00:01:43.320> they're

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
time the clips are really small they're

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
time the clips are really small they're
really<00:01:43.799> tight<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.640> grip<00:01:44.850> onto

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
really tight so they really grip onto

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.510 
really tight so they really grip onto
the<00:01:45.360> hair<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.350> suggest<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.490> have

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the hair I would suggest if you have

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
the hair I would suggest if you have
thinner<00:01:48.030> hair<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.450> might<00:01:48.689> work<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.990> little

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
thinner hair this might work a little

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
thinner hair this might work a little
bit<00:01:49.350> better<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> clips<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
bit better because the clips are a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
bit better because the clips are a
little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.200> smaller<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
little bit smaller so it's not going to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910 
little bit smaller so it's not going to
really<00:01:53.579> fit<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.140> already<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.619> really

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
thick hair it's gonna be it may be a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.590 
thick hair it's gonna be it may be a
