00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.740 
to me is the fixed antenna starting with
the<00:01:38.440> screen<00:01:38.770> size<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.340> 3.7<00:01:40.240> inch<00:01:40.360> screen<00:01:40.569> would

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
the screen size a 3.7 inch screen would

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.960 
the screen size a 3.7 inch screen would
be<00:01:40.840> great<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:41.890> Apple<00:01:42.340> has<00:01:42.459> kept<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.819> same

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
be great but Apple has kept the same

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.089 
be great but Apple has kept the same
screen<00:01:43.240> size<00:01:43.300> since<00:01:43.690> 2007<00:01:44.649> with<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.890> original

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
screen size since 2007 with the original

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.669 
screen size since 2007 with the original
iPhone<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.970> if<00:01:46.720> they<00:01:46.869> were<00:01:46.929> to<00:01:47.170> increase<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
iPhone and if they were to increase the

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.100 
iPhone and if they were to increase the
screen<00:01:47.920> size<00:01:48.069> to<00:01:48.280> 3.7<00:01:49.149> inches<00:01:49.420> none<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
screen size to 3.7 inches none of the

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.600 
screen size to 3.7 inches none of the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
apps in the App Store would have the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.699 
apps in the App Store would have the
proper<00:01:51.940> resolution<00:01:52.090> for<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.750> next<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
proper resolution for this next is the

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.770 
proper resolution for this next is the
design<00:01:54.069> it<00:01:54.280> seems<00:01:54.610> completely<00:01:54.849> unlikely<00:01:55.569> that

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
design it seems completely unlikely that

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.449 
design it seems completely unlikely that
Apple<00:01:56.080> will<00:01:56.200> unveil<00:01:56.349> a<00:01:56.530> totally<00:01:57.130> new<00:01:57.250> design

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
Apple will unveil a totally new design

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.400 
Apple will unveil a totally new design
for<00:01:57.849> the<00:01:57.910> verizon<00:01:58.360> iphone<00:01:58.479> they<00:01:59.020> just

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
for the verizon iphone they just

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.589 
for the verizon iphone they just
unveiled<00:01:59.649> this<00:02:00.069> totally<00:02:00.640> revamped<00:02:00.940> aluminum

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
unveiled this totally revamped aluminum

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.199 
unveiled this totally revamped aluminum
and<00:02:01.720> glass<00:02:01.750> design<00:02:02.380> not<00:02:03.099> even<00:02:03.369> two<00:02:03.640> months<00:02:03.849> ago

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
and glass design not even two months ago

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.359 
and glass design not even two months ago
I<00:02:04.360> just<00:02:04.630> don't<00:02:04.869> see<00:02:05.229> Apple<00:02:05.619> creating<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.130> whole

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
I just don't see Apple creating a whole

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.699 
I just don't see Apple creating a whole
new<00:02:06.399> design<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.239> verizon<00:02:07.630> iphone<00:02:07.750> 4<00:02:08.200> so

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
new design for the verizon iphone 4 so

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.740 
new design for the verizon iphone 4 so
soon<00:02:08.979> after<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.459> AT&amp;T<00:02:09.819> iPhone<00:02:10.300> 4<00:02:10.509> has<00:02:10.599> been

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
soon after the AT&amp;T iPhone 4 has been

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.540 
soon after the AT&amp;T iPhone 4 has been
released<00:02:11.110> they<00:02:11.380> usually<00:02:11.530> wait<00:02:11.890> at<00:02:12.069> least<00:02:12.099> a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
released they usually wait at least a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.250 
released they usually wait at least a
year<00:02:12.909> before<00:02:13.030> they<00:02:13.420> revamp<00:02:13.750> their<00:02:13.930> design

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
year before they revamp their design

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.899 
year before they revamp their design
again<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.709> overseas<00:02:15.250> where<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.549> iphone<00:02:15.879> is

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
again and overseas where the iphone is

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:16.890 
again and overseas where the iphone is
supported<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.510> more<00:02:16.689> than

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
supported on more than

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.089 
supported on more than
one<00:02:16.959> carrier<00:02:17.319> it's<00:02:17.709> not<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> completely

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
one carrier it's not a completely

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.800 
one carrier it's not a completely
different<00:02:18.700> iphone<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.269> just<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.569> same

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
different iphone it's just the same

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
different iphone it's just the same
phone<00:02:19.989> locked<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.439> a<00:02:20.470> different<00:02:20.829> carrier<00:02:21.069> so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
phone locked to a different carrier so

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.670 
phone locked to a different carrier so
this<00:02:21.939> is<00:02:21.970> further<00:02:22.239> proof<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.599> if<00:02:22.959> Apple<00:02:23.500> was

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
this is further proof that if Apple was

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.619 
this is further proof that if Apple was
to<00:02:23.890> announce<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.280> verizon<00:02:24.670> iphone<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.239> be<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
to announce a verizon iphone it be the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.050 
to announce a verizon iphone it be the
iphone<00:02:25.989> 4<00:02:26.200> just<00:02:26.500> with<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> cdma<00:02:27.430> radio<00:02:27.760> instead

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
iphone 4 just with a cdma radio instead

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.600 
iphone 4 just with a cdma radio instead
of<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.239> GSM<00:02:28.629> one<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.019> finally<00:02:29.650> we<00:02:29.769> have<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.950> 1.2

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
of a GSM one and finally we have the 1.2

gigahertz processor first of all Apple
does<00:02:32.739> not<00:02:32.769> like<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.099> announce<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.640> exact

specs for the processors in the iphone

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.410 
specs for the processors in the iphone
go<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.069> apple<00:02:36.280> website<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.700> check<00:02:36.939> they

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
go to the apple website in check they

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.330 
go to the apple website in check they
say<00:02:37.659> there's<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.109> apple<00:02:38.439> silicon<00:02:38.829> processor

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
say there's the apple silicon processor

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.949 
say there's the apple silicon processor
but<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.609> does<00:02:39.730> not<00:02:39.879> give<00:02:40.060> any<00:02:40.269> numbers<00:02:40.659> as<00:02:40.840> to

but it does not give any numbers as to

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.720 
but it does not give any numbers as to
how<00:02:41.140> much<00:02:41.290> processing<00:02:41.739> power<00:02:41.859> the<00:02:42.189> iphone<00:02:42.489> 4

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
how much processing power the iphone 4

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.640 
how much processing power the iphone 4
actually<00:02:43.120> has<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.840> while<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> faster

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
actually has and while a faster

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.099 
actually has and while a faster
processor<00:02:45.129> would<00:02:45.340> be<00:02:45.549> awesome<00:02:46.000> again<00:02:46.569> apple

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
processor would be awesome again apple

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.660 
processor would be awesome again apple
doesn't<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.560> make<00:02:47.739> major<00:02:47.980> changes<00:02:48.159> like
