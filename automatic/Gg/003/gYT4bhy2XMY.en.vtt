00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.770 
to turn that off - turn that off just
hit<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:19.040> map<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.700> want<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.000> disable<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
hit the map that you want to disable and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.460 
hit the map that you want to disable and
then<00:02:21.170> select<00:02:21.530> disable<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:23.600> could<00:02:23.780> also<00:02:23.900> verify

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
then select disable we could also verify

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.340 
then select disable we could also verify
the<00:02:24.530> mapping<00:02:25.100> through<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> map<00:02:25.640> screen<00:02:26.350> just

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
the mapping through the map screen just

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.860 
the mapping through the map screen just
select<00:02:27.650> map<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.550> should<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.209> maps

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
select map and you should see the maps

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.350 
select map and you should see the maps
come<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:30.470> away<00:02:30.640> because<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.820> not<00:02:32.030> in

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.229 
come up right away because I'm not in
the<00:02:32.989> western<00:02:33.500> United<00:02:33.950> States<00:02:33.980> I'm<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.940> seeing

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the western United States I'm not seeing

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.330 
the western United States I'm not seeing
anything<00:02:35.510> but<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:36.019> can<00:02:36.320> still<00:02:36.530> see<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.860> maps<00:02:37.100> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
anything but I can still see the maps I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.040 
anything but I can still see the maps I
have<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.790> pan<00:02:38.030> over<00:02:38.060> there<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.630> we're<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:38.989> to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
have to pan over there so we're going to

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.900 
have to pan over there so we're going to
zoom<00:02:39.350> out<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:42.310> then<00:02:43.310> we're<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.760> over

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
zoom out and then we're going to go over

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.220 
zoom out and then we're going to go over
to<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> West<00:02:44.450> us<00:02:46.390> I'm<00:02:47.390> going<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.570> Center<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.140> on

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
to the West us I'm going to Center it on

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.020 
to the West us I'm going to Center it on
the<00:02:48.290> screen<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:49.340> we're<00:02:49.519> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.700> zoom

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
the screen and then we're going to zoom

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.660 
the screen and then we're going to zoom
in<00:02:50.299> so<00:02:50.690> we'll<00:02:50.810> zoom<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:52.340> Oregon

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
in so we'll zoom in to the Oregon

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.330 
in so we'll zoom in to the Oregon
Washington<00:02:52.940> area<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.959> as<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:57.290> zoom<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
Washington area and as we zoom in the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.370 
Washington area and as we zoom in the
data<00:02:58.579> will<00:02:58.850> show<00:02:59.120> up<00:02:59.329> and<00:02:59.600> that's<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.079> other

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
data will show up and that's the other

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.350 
data will show up and that's the other
way<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.769> verifying<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.400> map<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:01.970> can<00:03:02.090> see

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
way of verifying the map so you can see

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.660 
way of verifying the map so you can see
all<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.660> maps<00:03:02.900> there<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.220> maps<00:03:04.400> have

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
all the maps there so the maps have

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.990 
all the maps there so the maps have
shaded<00:03:05.630> contour<00:03:06.350> lines<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.400> see<00:03:07.430> here

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
shaded contour lines you can see here

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.880 
shaded contour lines you can see here
part<00:03:08.329> of<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.600> hills<00:03:08.810> are<00:03:08.989> shaded<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.739> kind

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
part of the hills are shaded so it kind

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.940 
part of the hills are shaded so it kind
of<00:03:09.920> looks<00:03:10.130> like<00:03:10.220> 3d<00:03:10.820> we<00:03:11.510> have<00:03:11.810> our<00:03:12.079> trails<00:03:12.590> a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
of looks like 3d we have our trails a

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.310 
of looks like 3d we have our trails a
road<00:03:13.310> network<00:03:13.579> we<00:03:14.120> have<00:03:14.150> lots<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.690> geographic

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
road network we have lots of geographic

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.650 
road network we have lots of geographic
