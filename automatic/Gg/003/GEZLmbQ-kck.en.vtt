00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.370
 hey people from evening 9 speak again 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.990
 that weekly gaming tech news and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.610
 for this is going to start very much 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.780
 say what you see in the abyss this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.219
 namely if you like this once or twice 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.929
 with you on the computer 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.460
 and I cut some things out of it 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 because I have a job that is far too long or 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.449
 what i wanted to talk about today we go 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.740
 so I have him cut her something there 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.510
 half a minute of paper 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 pretty good the final score something of 32 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.420
 and 32 at three but in that trap 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 let's get started right away and i'm going 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.500
 start with apple apple you well one 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 Beginning made the iphone 5s and iphone 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 5c goes out in the Netherlands on October 25 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 come 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.860
 and he probably goes the iphone 5s 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 it will probably cost 699 euros 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 and the iphone 5c 599 euros and I'm going 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 mainly about the second one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 today namely the iphone 5c and I am 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 quite big 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 apple fan i have a macbook i have one 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.949
 iphone and they deliver to my i am 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 just fantastic products off alone 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 last month was of course the iphone 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 5c announced and a lot of analysts 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.119
 thought this was a cheaper iphone 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 would then be the iphone 5s and most 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.320
 We had analysts about 4 out of 10 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.520
 500 euros estimated that he will go 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.159
 Hatch 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 so only apple i made during that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 event announced that the iphone 5c but 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.340
 would cost no less than 599 euros 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 while the hardware is the same as in 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.710
 the iphone 5 that came out last year 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.450
 and that the iphone 5c and cheaper 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 plastic case to get saphan 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 which makes you less that exclusive 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.150
 felt like you did with one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.799
 aluminum iphone like the iphone 5 and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.590
 iphone 5s and rumor now that goes 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.140
 apple production of the iphone 5c 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.259
 halved due to disappointing demand 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 has the value acts 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 sales figures announced from it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.450
 very first weekend when the iphone 5s and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.930
 5c in sales training courses among others 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.719
 America and it turned out that those two were the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 phone nine million pieces together 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.610
 the first serve of the sold one 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 absolute record for apple 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.150
 but would not be announced 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.819
 what a ratio was the iphone 5c and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.340
 iphone 5s and rumors that the 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.600
 iphone 5s three times as popular as the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.300
 5c and that will probably come 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.810
 mainly due to the price of the iphone 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.750
 5c and apple which I think is with the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.970
 introduction of 5c off the shelf a bit 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.630
 Missed it is how she asks me 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.890
 must choose 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.420
 I go in with a 5c to 599 euros 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 year old hardware 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.650
 that is still fast but once old 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.140
 hardware with a plastic housing or 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.750
 I'd rather pay 100 euros more 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.870
 for that exclusive feel of 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.880
 the aluminum of the iphone 5s with one 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.860
 completely new hardware with a lot of fast 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 processor with that fingerprint scanner 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.810
 with a better camera 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.790
 I do not know what all I would 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.800
 say I have 100 euros for that 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.950
 about to go for the iphone 5s 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.540
 go and apparently shows that even in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.970
 that disappointing question from iphone 5c 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.459
 Mittens 5s which was sold out in everywhere 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.560
 Americans in England or in France 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.920
 the iphone 5c just still everywhere 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.049
 was out of stock and I would think if they did 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.269
 just for example to just 100 euros 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.180
 pick up what is just a pretty okay price 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.630
 then 4 dog 99 then that iphone 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.519
 5c much more popular mainly in 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.959
 other countries that just have less too 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.519
 than we have in the Netherlands and 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.950
 America and then of course you have to think 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.989
 to countries like China for example China 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.100
 is a huge country with 1.3 billion 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.570
 inhabitants 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.940
 they simply have less there 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.829
 to spend over five hours in europe and in 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.200
 america and 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.510
 590 euros for their yet to a 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.359
 unbelievably expensive price for one 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.950
 smartphone with old hardware and with a 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.799
 aluminum housing 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.829
 so I wonder if you had to choose 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.930
 between the iphone 5c and the 5s 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.109
 what would you choose and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.070
 that just brings me to that thing 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.049
 iphone 5c 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.910
 in my opinion is just a flop 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.290
 just a flop 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.940
 and that is mainly due to the price 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.530
 because I just hear a lot of people 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.860
 that iphone 5c from a good phone 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.539
 only that it and if and 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.729
 by telephone for the price of a high 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.889
 a phone and that is just really the 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.650
 price very many people had to order for 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.000
 iphone 5c to go but let them level 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.169
 I know in the comments that I like best 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.219
 curious about 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.389
 and then nice it here we had for this 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.590
 week then you have the thanks for it 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.120
 look do n't forget green thumbs up 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.650
 and then I see you 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.009
 next week thank you so much for it 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.060
 look 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.060
 and later
