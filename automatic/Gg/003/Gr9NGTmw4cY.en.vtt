have been 20 inch shafts and you've seen
on<00:02:24.500> our<00:02:24.800> 1850<00:02:25.730> trionic<00:02:26.270> Reata<00:02:26.720> video<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.319> we

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
on our 1850 trionic Reata video that we

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.220 
on our 1850 trionic Reata video that we
get<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.860> benefit<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:29.030> having<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.390> 25<00:02:29.959> inch

get the benefit to having a 25 inch
shaft<00:02:30.500> engine<00:02:30.770> now<00:02:31.580> that's<00:02:31.850> something<00:02:32.180> they

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
shaft engine now that's something they

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.850 
shaft engine now that's something they
didn't<00:02:32.569> do<00:02:32.660> standard<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.290> these<00:02:33.440> boats<00:02:33.709> from
