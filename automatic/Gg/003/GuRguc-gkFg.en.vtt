00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 and 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.599
 Yes 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.620
 it's been two years since 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.420
 in the fifth box we will have four agreements 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.420
 in this song that are going to be a back 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.300
 the minor 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.620
 that we will be blocked 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.900
 insolent seventh to finish 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.439
 easy disagreement to play a rhythmic 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.180
 we will repeat all along the piece 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.129
 that I will show you 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
 but if the decline that we often see 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:15.719
 a rhythm four times it's ba 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:26.669
 ba and we will be reminded four times by 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:30.079
 accor in fact so ba ba so we repeat 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.079
 his share accor 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.820
 me 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.820
 camille lacourt 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.540
 he 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.070
 that's it for this song you have 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.510
 almost everyone there is more than you 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.630
 tell the sequence agree his songs 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.280
 easy to learn so at pau 5th 15 and 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.450
 So that's the sequence 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.460
 okay for couples and it's going to be 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.450
 back 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.450
 the minor 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.790
 stronger and the 7th spell 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.209
 and we repeat race each time by 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.829
 couple and so for the troubles have 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.690
 started on a back to outsmart I believe 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.110
 it's twice twice the rhythmic 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.110
 on the tour 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.539
 6 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.539
 6 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 this 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.660
 so here are four times by accor 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.660
 so four times with put on the back 

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:50.680
 all 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.310
 these minors not 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.310
 but let's go 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.510
 Related 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.680
 the app 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.919
 and inevitably it sure says 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.910
 and here you have couples and so 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.070
 it's always the same thing 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.180
 verses and then there will be just one 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.130
 small variation that will be the bridge 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.130
 during the bridge will play the minor 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.060
 but the bridge in fact we will do it after 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.770
 the third verse and for actually one 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.510
 will play it twice this bridge but two 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.940
 times the first time towards so the 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.260
 minor four times alone 7th 4 times and one 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.260
 will start on fourth please 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.879
 then the fifth conflict we will play 

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:59.219
 the same chord sequence but actually 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.529
 and where she's going to do her solo with her 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.909
 voice that looks like a trumpet there and 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.940
 so we're going to do the same chords it's 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:09.120
 to say we wash an hour a week 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.500
 the lighthouse in pictures and then against 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.890
 we will have a bridge again to finish the 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.990
 song 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.550
 finally the agreements the minor one is the 7th 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.440
 except this time we 'll repeat it's up to 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.420
 say will make it a minor on the 7th 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.730
 four times per accor and started 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.730
 until the sinister song 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.319
 m 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.140
 these two solos so so I recap 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.990
 in fact what I'm drunk stuffed three 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.880
 couples and the bridge so the minor alone 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.560
 7th the first bridge did this once 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.990
 that is, the minor is the seventh 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.580
 once after fourth couple and 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.650
 so we do the minor's sequence 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.880
 facing the seventh in eight you redone 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.410
 the bridge either we'll do it twice 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.560
 that is to say the minor are sevenths 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.030
 the minor was done then we redid 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.860
 the sequence of couples and during the 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:18.840
 solo that she does with her voice and we 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.430
 will finish on the song with the minor 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.430
 on the 7th until the end of the song 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.380
 the rhythmic so always the same the 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.520
 agreements there are four to remember no 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.009
 bar is so really a song 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.289
 easy to learn in five minutes 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.430
 she's learned is by the way the video 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.680
 five minutes 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.849
 so at the end of the video where the worker 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.949
 know her 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:41.949
 jo more for a new video lease
