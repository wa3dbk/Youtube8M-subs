00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.109 
tough so there's a lot of things going
on<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.900> need<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.439> aware<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.000> so<00:00:21.000> right

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
now we can see that our opponent has

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.849 
now we can see that our opponent has
five<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.400> three<00:00:23.760> life<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.410> if<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.650> check

five we have three life and if we check

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.620 
five we have three life and if we check

is<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.369> need<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.700> rid<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
is we need to get rid of that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.520 
is we need to get rid of that
immediately<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.989> won't<00:00:34.170> even<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
immediately or we won't even have a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
immediately or we won't even have a
chance<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> tourney<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> do

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
chance to have a tourney and we can do

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.860 
chance to have a tourney and we can do
that<00:00:37.190> by<00:00:38.190> checking<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:38.969> our<00:00:39.000> artifact<00:00:39.629> over

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that by checking out our artifact over

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.459 
that by checking out our artifact over
here<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:41.510> which<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.540> Quicksilver

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
here on the right which is Quicksilver

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.319 
here on the right which is Quicksilver
amulet<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.309> tap<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.910> tap<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> we

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
amulet so if we tap for and tap it we

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
amulet so if we tap for and tap it we
can<00:00:45.450> put<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> creature<00:00:45.870> card<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.590> our<00:00:46.710> hand

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
can put a creature card from our hand

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
can put a creature card from our hand
onto<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.340> battlefield<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:48.270> away<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.770> we

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
onto the battlefield right away so if we

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
onto the battlefield right away so if we
do<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> use<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.910> card<00:00:51.289> which<00:00:52.289> will

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
do that and use this card which will

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
do that and use this card which will
exile<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.820> non<00:00:54.059> token<00:00:54.420> creature<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> then

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
exile a non token creature and then

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
exile a non token creature and then
duplicate<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.129> essentially<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:57.930> going

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
duplicate it essentially so we're going

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.510 
duplicate it essentially so we're going
to<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.100> we'll<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.430> able

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to do that right now and we'll be able

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:13.410 
to do that right now and we'll be able
to<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.030> our<00:01:00.300> turn

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.850 

I'm<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.570> gonna<00:01:14.750> choose<00:01:14.990> any<00:01:15.350> three<00:01:15.440> Lance

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
I'm just gonna choose any three Lance

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.010 
I'm just gonna choose any three Lance

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
doesn't matter alright so next up we

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.530 
doesn't matter alright so next up we
have<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:22.210> five<00:01:23.290> mana<00:01:24.290> cost<00:01:24.590> golem<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.300> have

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
have a five mana cost golem but we have

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.330 
have a five mana cost golem but we have
our<00:01:26.840> artifact<00:01:27.410> over<00:01:27.620> here<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.010> will<00:01:28.160> bring

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
our artifact over here that will bring

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.940 
our artifact over here that will bring
it<00:01:28.430> out<00:01:28.550> before<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.360> one<00:01:30.200> really<00:01:30.470> important

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
it out before and one really important

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.650 
it out before and one really important
aspect<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.370> this<00:01:31.490> puzzle<00:01:31.730> is<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.000> be<00:01:32.090> very<00:01:32.360> mana

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
aspect of this puzzle is to be very mana

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.230 
aspect of this puzzle is to be very mana
conscious<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:34.130> we<00:01:34.370> got<00:01:34.520> be<00:01:34.670> very<00:01:34.880> conservative

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
conscious so we got be very conservative

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.120 
conscious so we got be very conservative
here<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:35.900> we'll<00:01:36.110> use<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.770> bring<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.040> out

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
here and we'll use that to bring it out

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.550 
here and we'll use that to bring it out
for<00:01:37.310> four<00:01:37.550> mana<00:01:37.760> instead<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.870> five<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.780> that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
for four mana instead of five and that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.250 
for four mana instead of five and that
will<00:01:42.710> give<00:01:42.860> us<00:01:42.890> three<00:01:43.460> are<00:01:43.760> two<00:01:44.210> tokens<00:01:44.810> one

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
will give us three are two tokens one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.560 
will give us three are two tokens one
one<00:01:45.440> three<00:01:45.590> times<00:01:45.800> if<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:47.150> look<00:01:47.330> at<00:01:47.450> this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
one three times if you look at this

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.390 
one three times if you look at this
ability<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:48.140> says<00:01:48.380> whenever<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.800> player<00:01:48.950> casts

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
ability it says whenever a player casts

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.040 
ability it says whenever a player casts
an<00:01:49.460> instant<00:01:49.790> or<00:01:49.850> sorcery<00:01:50.210> spell<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.750> turns<00:01:50.930> a

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
an instant or sorcery spell that turns a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.570 
an instant or sorcery spell that turns a
golem<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.440> essentially<00:01:51.710> copy<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.460> no

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
golem you essentially copy that to no

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.180 
golem you essentially copy that to no
three<00:01:52.940> times<00:01:53.440> have<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.470> spell<00:01:54.740> right<00:01:54.860> here<00:01:55.040> that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
three times have a spell right here that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.260 
three times have a spell right here that
will<00:01:55.280> let's<00:01:55.490> draw<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> card

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
will let's draw a card

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.410 
will let's draw a card
so<00:01:57.170> if<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.530> use<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> goal<00:01:58.369> line<00:01:58.550> draw

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
so if we use that on a goal line draw

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.140 
so if we use that on a goal line draw
four<00:01:59.869> cards<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.130> full<00:02:01.340> four<00:02:01.700> homes<00:02:02.000> that

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
four cards for the full four homes that

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.870 
four cards for the full four homes that
we<00:02:02.210> haven't<00:02:02.420> play<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:03.100> these<00:02:04.100> four<00:02:04.369> cards<00:02:04.580> are

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
we haven't play and these four cards are

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.550 
we haven't play and these four cards are
predetermined<00:02:05.570> they're<00:02:05.690> out<00:02:05.840> random<00:02:06.260> so<00:02:06.500> you

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
predetermined they're out random so you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.220 
predetermined they're out random so you
get<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.950> same<00:02:07.190> four<00:02:07.460> cards<00:02:07.729> every<00:02:08.060> time

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.510 

all<00:02:14.230> right<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.800> lamb<00:02:15.070> would<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.460> be

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
all right so we have a lamb would you be

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.100 
all right so we have a lamb would you be
able<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.700> put<00:02:15.820> down<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.330> put<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.540> down<00:02:16.840> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
able to put down it so put that down and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.660 
able to put down it so put that down and
we<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> mocks<00:02:17.680> which<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.070> an<00:02:18.160> artifact

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
we have a mocks which is an artifact

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.340 
we have a mocks which is an artifact
that<00:02:18.760> counts<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.420> Atlantic's<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.990> put<00:02:20.170> that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
that counts this Atlantic's we put that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.030 
that counts this Atlantic's we put that
down<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.680> well

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
down as well

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.150

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
now we have eight man's world and first

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.700 
now we have eight man's world and first
we<00:02:24.370> want<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.670> put<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> look<00:02:25.360> at<00:02:25.510> our<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.260> see<00:02:26.410> mid

will let us put it out for three so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.050 
will let us put it out for three so

man conservative and now we're going to

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.890 
man conservative and now we're going to
use<00:02:41.320> our<00:02:41.650> icy<00:02:42.010> manipulator<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.760> tap<00:02:43.030> their<00:02:43.390> six

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
use our icy manipulator to tap their six

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.330 
use our icy manipulator to tap their six
six<00:02:44.110> flying<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.710> what<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.040> will<00:02:48.160> allow<00:02:48.250> us

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
six flying and what that will allow us

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.360 
six flying and what that will allow us
to<00:02:48.490> do<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.910> attack<00:02:49.270> unopposed<00:02:50.110> with<00:02:50.650> our<00:02:50.860> five

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
five flying right here or Hellkite so we

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.230 
five flying right here or Hellkite so we
brought<00:03:14.080> down<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.650> zero<00:03:14.950> life<00:03:15.250> but<00:03:15.730> he's<00:03:15.910> still

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
over here or an artifact that we'll take

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.390 
over here or an artifact that we'll take
a<00:03:21.040> look<00:03:21.310> at<00:03:21.460> really<00:03:21.700> fast<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.990> is<00:03:23.400> pure

so<00:03:40.140> thankfully<00:03:40.650> we<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.860> get<00:03:41.010> rid<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.190> that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
so thankfully we can get rid of that

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.160 
so thankfully we can get rid of that
because<00:03:41.700> we<00:03:41.850> have<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.209> Hellkite<00:03:42.720> over<00:03:42.959> here

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
because we have this Hellkite over here

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.040 
because we have this Hellkite over here
your<00:03:43.440> second<00:03:43.860> ability<00:03:44.310> lets<00:03:45.300> us<00:03:45.480> destroy<00:03:45.870> an

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
your second ability lets us destroy an

online permanent with converted mana

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.470 
online permanent with converted mana
cost<00:03:47.610> X<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.020> since<00:03:49.380> we<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.709> four<00:03:50.100> lands<00:03:50.480> we

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
cost X so since we have four lands we

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.020 
cost X so since we have four lands we
can<00:03:51.720> use<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.230> ability<00:03:55.670> take<00:03:56.670> out<00:03:56.850> that
