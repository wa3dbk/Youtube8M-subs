00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:11.300
 Hi Graph 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.300
 I wrote to the bottom line with the tube axis, why now it would constitute displaced nya 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:24.650
 I'm here to release some of your cube space . 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.650
 There are a couple of these people who are doing this. 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:35.730
 This piece of East 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.360
 Now, my dad, he's missing the sculpture limit. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.000
 Then the team will 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.539
 Yes Put in your pocket 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.539
 Talk 2 fold this piece and continue on to the sixties 107 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.410
 Let's continue with Dis, except we're out of here. 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.410
 Then you should be able to jump right there. 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.650
 4 and 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.110
 You 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:15.260
 This cube is always packed with different colors 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:19.910
 So if you're good at coughing, 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:26.720
 Well, it can also easily fall well kkopeul 1 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:29.840
 Note that the teaching of going to some well-know secrets plugging into sin'll sleep 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.100
 Oh, I'm up 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:42.610
 If you teach a voting vote to get a good hit tube 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:42.610
 Let me get this straight at this angle . 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.450
 Just a dream Just a dream 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:59.840
 Listen, go home, take care of me the notes fell more so because no apparent 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:03.550
 For Ghana, then surprised such a thing does not fall straight in the piece 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.500
 That's because he's not there. 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.750
 2 Now my brother is not going to be a completely cubes Department 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.750
 The book is a little small 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.819
 Yeah 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.340
 Shadow Saints To Go 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.849
 No, why not? 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.970
 Yes, it's stiff and sticky . 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:36.709
 Totally I've seen Distra 4 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:41.360
 So it does not go well 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.780
 It takes a long time to assemble. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:50.690
 This is just napping 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:54.440
 I just YouTube, write notes, such as This is another way to have the tube so 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.740
 There may be some of you. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.210
 Just change those cubes together 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.210
 I'll put it in my bag . 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.240
 Just pull this kkeulyeodo new silver gold 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.240
 It's a good idea to change the cube 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.390
 With these tubes. 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.610
 The net part is good. 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.780
 That's what this part is like when I turn around. 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.780
 It's so connected. 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.770
 Yes 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.080
 Solo Oye 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.400
 If you need themes now 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:53.470
 5 That's real here 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.040
 I'll finish the creeple quack. 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.040
