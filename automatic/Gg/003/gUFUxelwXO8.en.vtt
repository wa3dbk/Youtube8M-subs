 and thank God for allowing me 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.570
 in April 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.220
 and despite the immense love I feel 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.460
 you will forget that Sunday morning 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.090
 you do not have to there is not stopped looking 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.320
 force 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.390
 how to forget our first 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.340
 very extensive conversations them 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.820
 I was in bonded to yours 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.790
 I do not know if I want to know them 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.550

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.510
 but it's just going to sound 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.600
 It was so simple that my heart stayed 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.140
 trained of you 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.160

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.500
 here unknown 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.490
 this time 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.410
 if you are, it strengthens me when I am weak 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.750

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.439
 when 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.969
 I'm crestfallen if you're my voice when I 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.969
 missing words to raise a sentence 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.640
 not be in love 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.050

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.899
 and I give myself to you to share 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.899
 You can trust 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.920
 promises to be scarce and would share caring 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.920

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.400
 when I cry with strength 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 when you forget to share with everyone 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.960
 everything I am all I have 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.090

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.360
 and I am committing myself and declared 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.250
 adjective 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.810
 before our parents, family friends 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.270
 to highlight 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.579
 under the watchful eye of our babies 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.149
 to not leave in any way that arises 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.300
 in my mind or in my heart the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
 possibility of moving away my physical nor 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.510
 emotional 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.510

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.439

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.129

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.129
 ministry 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.379
 and it has been better than I get 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.219

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.760
 passage is not studied 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.480
 and it's going to be real everything we're going to 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.060
 keep living all the things that 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.520

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.510
 God did for us what God 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.510
 did with our actions

 because I know that millions say he has 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.620
 but more than that I know that God loves us and 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.180
 for that immense love that we have is that 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.270
 we can walk ourselves 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.479
