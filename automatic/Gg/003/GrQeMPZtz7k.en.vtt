00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.030 

good<00:00:42.149> combo<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.750> real<00:00:42.930> Kim<00:00:43.170> he<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
good combo here from real Kim he is in

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
good combo here from real Kim he is in
the<00:00:44.129> loser<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.460> he's<00:00:44.579> gonna<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> reset<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the loser so he's gonna have to reset to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
the loser so he's gonna have to reset to
win<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.640> reset<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.090> another<00:00:48.180> set

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
win this reset and then take another set

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.740 
win this reset and then take another set
to<00:00:48.690> win<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.610> there<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.760> go<00:00:50.879> what's<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to win this there you go what's that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.310 
to win this there you go what's that
chunks<00:00:57.350> yeah<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> believe<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.480> good<00:01:00.480> gets<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
chunks yeah I believe so good gets the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.479 
chunks yeah I believe so good gets the
jump<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.680> punch<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.010> doesn't<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> full

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
jump in punch but doesn't get the full

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
jump in punch but doesn't get the full
combo<00:01:02.789> afterwards<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:04.320> think<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.830> input<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
combo afterwards I think the input is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.420 
combo afterwards I think the input is
something<00:01:05.519> where<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.670> hit<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> D<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
something where you hit a and D or a and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700 
something where you hit a and D or a and
C<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> same<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> lets<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> do

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
C at the same time and it lets you do

realized that character his problem yep
and<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:23.360> thing<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.600> don't<00:02:23.660> see<00:02:23.930> real<00:02:24.530> can

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
and the one thing I don't see real can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.880 
and the one thing I don't see real can
do<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.400> go<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.420> feint<00:02:26.660> cancels<00:02:27.170> off<00:02:27.470> his<00:02:27.680> block

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
do is go for feint cancels off his block

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.710 
do is go for feint cancels off his block
strings<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:28.760> true<00:02:29.000> because<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.570> makes

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
strings that's true because it makes

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.509 
strings that's true because it makes
that<00:02:29.840> boot<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:30.350> from<00:02:30.650> slightly<00:02:31.040> negative<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
that boot go from slightly negative and

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.610 
that boot go from slightly negative and
-<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.209> think<00:02:32.450> slightly<00:02:32.840> advantage<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.590> block

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
- I think slightly advantage on block

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.650 
- I think slightly advantage on block
you<00:02:34.430> know<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.580> don't<00:02:34.819> see<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> lot<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.180> shuns<00:02:35.510> in

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
you know I don't see a lot of shuns in

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
yeah it does feel familiar to so it's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.800 
yeah it does feel familiar to so it's
pretty<00:02:40.310> obnoxious<00:02:40.540> when<00:02:41.540> you're<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.750> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630

thought it wasn't a thing that's right
just<00:04:07.350> when<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.590> thought<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.830> was<00:04:08.100> safe<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.460> go

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670

things that are so yeah they just
noticed<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:27.210> matches<00:05:27.570> these<00:05:27.660> pillars

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
noticed the matches these pillars

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.750 
noticed the matches these pillars
suited<00:05:28.320> they<00:05:28.620> got<00:05:28.740> like<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.889> whole<00:05:29.100> ensemble<00:05:29.669> it

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
suited they got like a whole ensemble it

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.050 
suited they got like a whole ensemble it
going<00:05:29.940> on<00:05:30.150> man<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:31.530> almost<00:05:31.770> like<00:05:32.190> they<00:05:32.790> knew

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
going on man it's almost like they knew

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:42.529 
going on man it's almost like they knew
they<00:05:33.270> were<00:05:33.330> gonna<00:05:33.540> be<00:05:33.750> here<00:05:41.030> maybe<00:05:42.030> he's<00:05:42.360> going

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
they were gonna be here maybe he's going

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.969 
they were gonna be here maybe he's going
with<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.840> strategy<00:05:43.289> in<00:05:43.440> a<00:05:43.560> backwards

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
with the strategy in a backwards

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.010 
with the strategy in a backwards
direction<00:05:44.130> so<00:05:45.060> sometimes<00:05:45.479> you<00:05:45.660> threaten<00:05:45.960> with

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
direction so sometimes you threaten with

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.330 
direction so sometimes you threaten with
command<00:05:46.350> throw<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.740> through<00:05:46.890> it<00:05:46.950> with<00:05:47.130> lows

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
command throw you through it with lows

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.490 
command throw you through it with lows
to<00:05:47.789> open<00:05:48.090> up<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.330> avenue<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:49.020> hitting<00:05:49.380> them

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
to open up the avenue of hitting them

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.320 
to open up the avenue of hitting them
with<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.650> overhead<00:05:50.039> maybe<00:05:50.669> he<00:05:50.880> just<00:05:51.030> got<00:05:51.120> him

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
with the overhead maybe he just got him

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.360 
with the overhead maybe he just got him
so<00:05:51.539> used<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.840> blocking<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.260> overhead<00:05:52.620> did<00:05:53.310> he

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
so used to blocking the overhead did he

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.650 
so used to blocking the overhead did he
opened<00:05:53.669> up<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:53.850> avenue<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.210> just<00:05:54.419> being<00:05:54.539> able

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
opened up the avenue of just being able

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.170 
opened up the avenue of just being able
to<00:05:54.840> do<00:05:54.960> run-up<00:05:55.289> grim<00:05:56.990> if<00:05:57.990> that's<00:05:58.350> true<00:05:58.680> it's

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
to do run-up grim if that's true it's

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.909 
to do run-up grim if that's true it's
pretty<00:06:00.180> smart<00:06:00.570> except<00:06:01.289> for<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.560> fact<00:06:01.770> that

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
pretty smart except for the fact that

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.460 
pretty smart except for the fact that
he's<00:06:02.100> down<00:06:02.250> again<00:06:02.430> yes<00:06:03.300> yeah<00:06:03.570> but<00:06:03.840> diabolical

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
he's down again yes yeah but diabolical

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.900 
he's down again yes yeah but diabolical
anyway<00:06:04.740> because<00:06:04.889> some<00:06:05.280> Makaveli<00:06:05.789> in

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
anyway because some Makaveli in

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.780 
anyway because some Makaveli in
decision-making

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.360 

oh<00:06:10.230> yeah<00:06:11.230> it<00:06:11.290> was<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.560> really<00:06:11.770> good<00:06:12.010> rollback

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
oh yeah it was a really good rollback
