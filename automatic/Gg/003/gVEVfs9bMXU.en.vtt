00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.130 
and the fact that some reason when I
play<00:06:05.840> music<00:06:05.960> on<00:06:06.290> my<00:06:06.880> laptop<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.420> CD<00:06:08.690> that's<00:06:08.990> in

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
play music on my laptop the CD that's in

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.980 
play music on my laptop the CD that's in
there<00:06:09.550> it<00:06:10.550> makes<00:06:10.760> a<00:06:10.850> very<00:06:10.880> annoying<00:06:11.570> buzzing

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
there it makes a very annoying buzzing

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.620 
there it makes a very annoying buzzing
sound<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:13.400> what<00:06:13.940> I<00:06:14.000> think<00:06:14.270> I'm<00:06:14.360> going<00:06:14.450> to<00:06:14.510> have

sound so what I think I'm going to have
to<00:06:14.660> do<00:06:14.840> is<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.730> burnt<00:06:17.170> copy<00:06:18.170> the<00:06:18.410> music<00:06:18.530> to
