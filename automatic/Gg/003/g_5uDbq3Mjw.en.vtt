00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
at my camera right now I don't know

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.900 
at my camera right now I don't know
what's<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:05.130> on<00:03:05.250> but<00:03:05.549> look<00:03:07.519> this<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.730> how

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
what's going on but look this is how

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.080 
what's going on but look this is how
then<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.450> is

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
then it is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.250 
then it is
although<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.960> very<00:03:12.020> very<00:03:12.800> very<00:03:13.100> thin<00:03:14.260> so

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
although this is very very very thin so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.830 
although this is very very very thin so
I<00:03:15.650> guess<00:03:16.340> that's<00:03:16.580> why<00:03:16.760> they<00:03:16.910> say<00:03:17.210> all<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.690> it

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
I guess that's why they say all of it

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.820 
I guess that's why they say all of it
can<00:03:17.990> fit<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:19.010> your<00:03:19.400> head<00:03:19.670> because<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.500> very

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
can fit in your head because it is very

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.780 
can fit in your head because it is very
thin<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.790> um<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.200> like<00:03:24.740> it<00:03:25.010> though<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.430> really

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520 
thin so um I like it though I really
like<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.270> this<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.660> bank<00:03:26.900> piece<00:03:27.170> but<00:03:27.470> I
