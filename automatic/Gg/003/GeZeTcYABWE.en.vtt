00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.300
 Hello dear users 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 now apparently 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.920
 one of those few cases yes I 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.849
 I can really guess what 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.640
 still sent me a chinese it with 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.939
 99 percent holder for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 bicycle bottles 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 let's see this yes it is here 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 created something like vacuum packs 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.690
 some topic so she is very richly 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.490
 strongly delays immediately everything was visible and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.860
 it was even uninteresting and well this is already 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.960
 quite another thing so we have 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 plastic like the base here i'm not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.220
 I know the metal as it were part of there 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 or not something like that seems to me 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.739
 that here is this metal by the way in my 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 aluminum it ends somewhere here 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 now if it continued here to me 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.460
 it seems it was easy to just 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.399
 awesome but alas, no but we have it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 be regulated is regulated by 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.920
 here it can be customized here vintage 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 under the diameter of the bottle that we 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 it is needed in general is pretty cool 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.090
 but I like you 100 but still 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.090
 plastic somehow not trusting plastic 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.060
 because if it was entirely 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.549
 metal they him hitting 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.899
 steel it was two much cooler but 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.450
 but it is regulated 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.520
 what a nice bottle holder i 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.889
 I think it is at least much higher 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.520
 than whole if it is made of 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:47.130
 Plastics Well, that's pretty sea juices 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.229
 two holes three probably there are two 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.779
 base to one hole for installation on 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.350
 bicycle frame 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:58.229
 screw to adjust the diameter of the bottle well 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.329
 and all in the cut nothing we have here 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.359
 here it is like a lock washer that nut 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.259
 that is, I donâ€™t know how to teach such a funny 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:09.780
 the little thing later accomplish your goal in the comments 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.929
 how much she served and what opinion 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 not owner 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.790
 thank you for your attention and see you soon 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.790
 meeting
