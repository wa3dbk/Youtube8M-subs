00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
about it this is it so this is the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.410 
about it this is it so this is the
hardware<00:01:12.229> piece<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:12.740> connects<00:01:13.010> your

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
hardware piece that connects your

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.310 
hardware piece that connects your
projector<00:01:14.420> TV<00:01:14.840> monitor<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:16.430> connects<00:01:16.930> vga<00:01:17.930> or

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
projector TV monitor it connects vga or

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.830 
projector TV monitor it connects vga or
s-video<00:01:18.910> that's<00:01:19.910> it<00:01:20.000> with<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.210> VGA<00:01:20.510> connector

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
s-video that's it with the VGA connector

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.050 
s-video that's it with the VGA connector
it'll<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.290> resolutions<00:01:21.860> up<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.130> xga<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:22.940> it's

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
it'll do resolutions up to xga so it's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.750 
it'll do resolutions up to xga so it's
actually<00:01:23.180> four<00:01:23.570> x<00:01:23.690> 768<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:25.100> you're<00:01:25.369> connecting

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
actually four x 768 if you're connecting

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.180 
actually four x 768 if you're connecting
via<00:01:25.880> s-video<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.780> happen<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.619> be<00:01:27.740> overseas

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
via s-video and happen to be overseas

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.260 
via s-video and happen to be overseas
will<00:01:28.460> do<00:01:28.610> ntsc<00:01:29.210> or<00:01:29.240> pal

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.139 

back<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.640> projection<00:01:38.640> device<00:01:38.759> or

so again micro USB AC adapter the you
also<00:02:33.850> have<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> USB<00:02:34.480> cable<00:02:34.930> for<00:02:35.110> upgrades

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
also have the USB cable for upgrades

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.850 
also have the USB cable for upgrades
exactly<00:02:36.460> what<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.270> cost<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.320> this<00:02:38.530> cost

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
exactly what is this cost so this cost
