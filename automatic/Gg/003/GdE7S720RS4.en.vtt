that<00:02:26.230> role<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.220> then<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.550> choices<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.120> make

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
that role but then the choices you make

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.970 
that role but then the choices you make
you<00:02:28.510> also<00:02:28.660> lose<00:02:28.959> out<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.230> certain<00:02:29.770> work

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
you also lose out on certain work

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.430 
you also lose out on certain work
because<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:30.880> not<00:02:31.060> as<00:02:31.300> visible<00:02:31.959> you're<00:02:32.260> not

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
because you're not as visible you're not

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.250 
because you're not as visible you're not
as<00:02:32.680> marketable<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.930> think

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
as marketable and all of that so I think

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.680 
as marketable and all of that so I think
in<00:02:35.530> some<00:02:35.560> ways<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.190> felt<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.640> okay<00:02:36.970> here

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
in some ways I felt that okay here

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.840 
in some ways I felt that okay here
some<00:02:38.410> people<00:02:38.770> are<00:02:38.890> recognizing<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.580> fact

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
some people are recognizing the fact

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.550 
some people are recognizing the fact
that<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.120> choices<00:02:40.360> I've<00:02:40.630> made<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.350> bad

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that the choices I've made on that bad

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.830 
that the choices I've made on that bad
so<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.130> sense<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.580> wasn't<00:02:42.760> sort<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.239> big

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
so in that sense it wasn't sort of a big

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.570 
so in that sense it wasn't sort of a big
deal<00:02:44.050> or<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.290> was<00:02:44.530> waiting<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.190> kind<00:02:45.459> of

let<00:03:36.700> me<00:03:36.850> try<00:03:37.120> 10<00:03:37.360> films<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.930> see<00:03:38.140> how<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.440> goes

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
let me try 10 films and see how it goes

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.500 
let me try 10 films and see how it goes
sometimes<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.670> dance<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:40.420> know

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
sometimes I dance and because you know

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.030 
sometimes I dance and because you know
but<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.780> dance<00:03:41.019> well<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.590> could<00:03:41.769> have<00:03:41.859> done

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
but you dance well you could have done

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.009 
but you dance well you could have done
Bollywood<00:03:42.549> so<00:03:43.030> they<00:03:43.150> think<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.600> it's<00:03:43.750> it's

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
Bollywood so they think that it's it's

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.680 
Bollywood so they think that it's it's
something<00:03:44.500> about<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.340> can't<00:03:46.060> kind<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.570> a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
something about can and can't kind of a

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.449 
something about can and can't kind of a
thing<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.900> know<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.260> more<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.530> choice<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.370> I

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
thing you know it's more a choice and I

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.130 
thing you know it's more a choice and I
think<00:03:48.489> that's<00:03:48.820> sometimes<00:03:49.570> tough<00:03:49.840> for<00:03:49.989> people

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
think that's sometimes tough for people

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.900 
think that's sometimes tough for people
to<00:03:50.410> understand<00:03:50.950> because<00:03:51.100> they<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.459> acting

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
to understand because they think acting

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.449 
to understand because they think acting
is<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.570> get<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.750> name<00:03:53.049> and<00:03:53.260> fame<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.560> if<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.310> is

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
is to get a name and fame and if it is

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.009 
is to get a name and fame and if it is
for<00:03:54.609> all<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:55.030> why<00:03:55.359> would<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:55.660> want<00:03:55.780> to

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
for all of that why would you want to

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.780 
for all of that why would you want to
deny<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:56.709> it's<00:03:56.859> not<00:03:56.980> about<00:03:57.190> denying<00:03:57.579> it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
deny it but it's not about denying it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.520 
deny it but it's not about denying it
it's<00:03:57.940> it's<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.660> choice<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:59.079> life

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
it's it's a choice of life

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.410 
it's it's a choice of life
all<00:03:59.590> right<00:03:59.709> let's<00:03:59.890> switch<00:04:00.040> tactics<00:04:00.730> all<00:04:01.239> right

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
all right let's switch tactics all right

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.400 
all right let's switch tactics all right
yeah<00:04:01.810> on<00:04:03.600> right<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:05.620> landmark<00:04:06.340> movies<00:04:07.410> which

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
yeah on right to landmark movies which

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.289 
yeah on right to landmark movies which
less<00:04:08.859> we<00:04:09.130> can<00:04:09.250> talk<00:04:09.430> about<00:04:09.519> movies<00:04:09.910> in<00:04:10.030> just<00:04:10.209> a

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
less we can talk about movies in just a

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.870 
less we can talk about movies in just a
second<00:04:10.720> but<00:04:11.200> post<00:04:11.739> movies<00:04:12.250> ordering<00:04:12.790> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
second but post movies ordering the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.259 
second but post movies ordering the
movies<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.269> riots<00:04:13.780> which<00:04:14.440> happen<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.459> I

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
movies the riots which happen the I

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.670 
movies the riots which happen the I
guess<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.840> could<00:04:16.959> call<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.380> attention

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
guess you could call it the attention

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.670 
guess you could call it the attention
which<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.489> movies<00:04:18.789> was<00:04:18.940> given<00:04:19.269> I'm<00:04:20.260> not<00:04:20.440> going

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
which the movies was given I'm not going

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.350 
which the movies was given I'm not going
to<00:04:20.739> get<00:04:20.890> into<00:04:21.039> exactly<00:04:21.640> why<00:04:21.820> or<00:04:22.000> why<00:04:22.120> not<00:04:22.330> I

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
to get into exactly why or why not I

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
to get into exactly why or why not I
think<00:04:22.510> that's<00:04:22.870> been<00:04:23.110> done<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.440> death

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
think that's been done to death

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.970 
think that's been done to death
but<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.310> want<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.610> talk<00:04:24.820> about<00:04:25.470> just<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.650> simple

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
but I want to talk about just the simple

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.810 
but I want to talk about just the simple
fact<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.610> why<00:04:28.210> isn't<00:04:28.780> India<00:04:29.740> ready<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.550> take

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
fact that why isn't India ready to take

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.140 
fact that why isn't India ready to take
on<00:04:31.090> tough<00:04:31.690> gritty<00:04:32.290> issues<00:04:33.000> through<00:04:34.000> its

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
on tough gritty issues through its

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.050 
on tough gritty issues through its
cinema<00:04:35.160> considering<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.280> history<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.730> Indian
