00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 lately I see a lot of people training 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.710
 basic and heavy training with routines 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 of strength when they have goals 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.880
 aesthetic goals of hypertrophy 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 I also see that many of you put me 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 in your comments your routines 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.050
 and you tell me that our goal is to win 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 muscle mass and many of them do not go 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.099
 focused on the objective binding but that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.960
 they are more like an approach like a game of 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.380
 sports performance not of strength in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 this case this is not correct is not 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.500
 right because it's not the most efficient 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 It's true that I always said that the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.110
 strength is a pillar but the one that more 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
 important and more determinant in that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
 to build muscle mass but 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.500
 this does not mean that it is the least 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.879
 we have to support but that is what 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 we have to take into account that is 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 we have to take into account every month or 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 every so often stronger than the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 previous stage this is what it will tell us 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.710
 that we are progressing and ultimately 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.480
 what will keep us moving forward in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.300
 Aranda a muscle so they are 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.730
 previous videos about those 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.970
 variables that produce hypertrophy that 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.510
 are the time for your attention and the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.520
 Work intensity 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 mechanical stress 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.570
 the breaks the ranges of repetitions 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.310
 in general the density of work with 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.610
 who chose working density 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.250
 the work density I mean the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.740
 number of repetitions we do in a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.319
 determined space of time is to say 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.390
 if in a routine we perform 30 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:42.810
 repetitions in 5 minutes with 60 kilos 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.719
 of weight and we made with the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.599
 same weight with the same weight in bar is 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.849
 say 60 kilos 20 repetitions in the 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:54.750
 same time will be more determining 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:57.810
 how much hypertrophy does the rupture with which 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880
 let's do 30 repetitions at the same time 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.319
 this at first is worth no 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 generalize but it's like that at first 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.240
 why because we are 5 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.380
 more work in the same space of 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.820
 time like this has a beginning not the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 production plus hypertrophy that would be the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.400
 work density 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.069
 as I repeat, the force is decisive 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.890
 because that is going to be the first step to 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.830
 improve for what the progression gives us 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.959
 the cargo profession then is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 illogical train with power routines of 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.280
 esther if we do not want to be a bit of 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.019
 ether because it is our agent things 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.790
 technique because we are training with 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.189
 basic exercise routines 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.989
 focused on strength you have to have 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.939
 Of course, although strength is important 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.890
 and it's not all that many say 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.750
 that if you have some legs like two 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.239
 bad columns need diaz and appeal 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.480
 with the balls on the floor is a lie 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.129
 it is a lie some people especially 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.680
 those who defend the strength of everything 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.870
 they may be against it but it is that 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.879
 it's true it's true that the squat is 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.639
 a great exercise because it is one of the 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.230
 what else are you going to involve but it's not what 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.389
 more determinant apart from doing 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.640
 other exercises where we isolate that 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.790
 work and we can give it 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.100
 a work density as I said 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.900
 greater to stimulate more fibers and in 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.520
 general that work is more efficient 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.580
 and our goal is to win 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.860
 Hypertrophy is more efficient too 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.230
 taking into account the intensity that is 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.850
 the bar weight and the density of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.680
 work that as I said is the volume 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.930
 of total work worth say for 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.820
 summarize what I recommend is to have a 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.370
 pure relationship between the two formulas 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.870
 relationship between intensity and density by 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.300
 I always recommend routines 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.220
 hybrid and not to complicate the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.320
 people of I recommend the profession of 53 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.810
 with the basics to gain strength for 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.050
 improve our brands and at the same time meter 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.420
 more work focused on terms of 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.150
 hypertrophy with supplements for said 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.250
 muscles what to put more density of 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.250
 work and to produce more hypertrophy 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.420
 an example of routine that seems very 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.070
 correct about what I say is 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.410
 efficient routines sibility of 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.810
 the routines of strength and hypertrophy that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.240
 they do not rely on just stimulating the muscle 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.760
 but also focus on improving 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.990
 our brands and make them stronger 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.850
 it's the routine 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.410
 this routine of lunada and tourism for 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.540
 beginner people I recommend it for 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.890
 intermediate people advanced onwards 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.990
 ok because it's a pretty routine 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.200
 william plaintiff and for beginners 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.820
 I see it a bit inadequate but something if 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.310
 is another example for you to see what 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.920
 is and they will understand it since we are and 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.780
 probably many people think that the 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.510
 basic work force routines 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.050
 and heavy have been adequate to get 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.940
 a body 10 is the case of explosive 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.880
 explosive has a body of the whore 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.290
 host but it is that explosive apart from 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.440
 that all gods have a 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.020
 factor that in this case accompanies that 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.020
 is genetics has a genetic 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.900
 this example but if you have an example 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.060
 very clear gave life or poor explosive 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.400
 as the Nazis many lift 180 kilos 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.170
 nice you are going to tell me that raising 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.870
 180 kilos is wrong that will not have that 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.300
 rejection that has a brand over 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:22.240
 260 days and 250 deadweight 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.699
 and recently subdued two sub-brands 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.349
 brutal towers to the vine you put it now 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.870
 training with more training 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.139
 according to what is technical and is 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.550
 that muta has a body that we are going to 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.220
 business wills 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.250
 then it is not an example to follow 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.170
 because anyone with some brands 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.720
 how he's going to be a fucking mother what 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.760
 difficult is to get there and it's the way 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.770
 slow that's clear because when 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.180
 our goal is aesthetics as 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.890
 I say no need to focus are the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.249
 strength routines because that's the most 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.919
 efficient for people who want to compete 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:01.529
 power ballet tournaments in competitions 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.819
 where the maximum force is measured so 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.919
 what I want to imply is that if 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.529
 your goal is not strength but the 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.569
 aesthetics or a middle term between strength 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.429
 and aesthetics what I recommend are the 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.439
 hybrid routines several routines where 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:16.469
 work strength in petro what either 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.059
 on the day disk or a force day and another 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.069
 day more focused on hypertrophy as 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.289
 is the case of the fad that named 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.199
 previously consisting of two days 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.689
 of strength in which one is heavy torso 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.029
 and another heavy leg and three days 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.589
 focused on hypertrophy can be 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:35.219
 do so or it can be done by hanging from 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:38.129
 same in three ranges of strength and ranges 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.959
 of hypertrophy and this is how 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.099
 I just wanted to clarify porterior 

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:42.509
 that there are many doubts about this and 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.149
 literally installing more 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.429
 importance to basic and heavy work 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:49.420
 in terms of aesthetic gains 

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:52.090
 muscle gains 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.340
 first about routines focused on 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.630
 work focused hypertrophy as I say 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.700
 this the correct model 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.830
 I repeat again the force is very 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.660
 important but should not be put aside 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.630
 hypertrophy work in 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:10.990
 complements focused on such objectives 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.990
