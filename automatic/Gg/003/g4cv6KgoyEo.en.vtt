00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.990 

I<00:02:03.229> don't<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.619> maybe<00:02:05.130> last<00:02:05.460> year<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
I don't know when maybe last year or the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.779 
I don't know when maybe last year or the
year<00:02:06.030> before<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.009> definitely<00:02:08.670> all

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
year before but this is definitely all

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
year before but this is definitely all
burn<00:02:09.060> forests<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.289> outside<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
burn forests for just outside of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.880 
burn forests for just outside of
Roscommon<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:12.110> don't<00:02:13.110> come<00:02:13.319> there<00:02:13.590> being<00:02:13.800> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
Roscommon I don't come there being a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.750 
Roscommon I don't come there being a
fire<00:02:14.100> down<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:16.739> sure<00:02:17.040> looks<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.489> fire

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
fire down here that sure looks like fire

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:37.280 
fire down here that sure looks like fire
those<00:02:18.630> are<00:02:18.780> burnt<00:02:19.020> trees<00:02:35.660> see<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> long<00:02:36.989> time

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
those are burnt trees see a long time

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.050 
those are burnt trees see a long time
ago<00:02:37.560> not<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.070> long<00:02:38.280> time<00:02:38.459> ago<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.790> there<00:02:38.970> was

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
ago not a long time ago but there was

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.610 
ago not a long time ago but there was
definitely<00:02:39.570> fire<00:02:39.810> over<00:02:40.050> here<00:02:40.080> but<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:40.530> they

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
definitely fire over here but then they

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.740 
definitely fire over here but then they
cleared<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.100> out<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.610> I'm<00:02:41.730> assuming<00:02:42.209> these

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
cleared it all out so I'm assuming these

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.680 
cleared it all out so I'm assuming these
are<00:02:42.810> small<00:02:43.320> trees<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:44.850> bet<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.450> fire

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
are small trees so I bet when this fire

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.020 
are small trees so I bet when this fire
happened<00:02:46.200> these<00:02:46.980> three<00:02:47.370> started<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.850> grow

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
happened these three started to grow

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.520 
happened these three started to grow
back

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.630 

like<00:02:54.530> all<00:02:54.709> these<00:02:54.890> little<00:02:55.069> trees<00:02:55.370> over<00:02:55.610> here

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
like all these little trees over here

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.809 
like all these little trees over here
burn<00:02:56.060> too

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
burn too

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.620 
burn too
