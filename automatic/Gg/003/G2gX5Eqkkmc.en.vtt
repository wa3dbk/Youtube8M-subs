that<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.760> at<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.970> moment<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.410> can

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
that I have at the moment it is it can

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.800 
that I have at the moment it is it can
be<00:03:01.980> quite<00:03:02.190> hard<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.760> actually<00:03:02.940> mount<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
be quite hard to actually mount the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.400 
be quite hard to actually mount the
camera<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.590> cage<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.370> um<00:03:05.580> because<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
camera to the cage but um because the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.610 
camera to the cage but um because the
little<00:03:07.650> knob<00:03:08.160> here<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.640> allows<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
little knob here that allows you to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.200 
little knob here that allows you to
tighten<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.830> quarter<00:03:11.280> inch<00:03:11.430> screws<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:12.030> mount

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
tighten the quarter inch screws to mount

tighten the quarter inch screws to mount
the<00:03:12.720> camera<00:03:13.320> can<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.040> some<00:03:14.400> sometimes<00:03:15.300> hard<00:03:15.750> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the camera can be some sometimes hard to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.270 
the camera can be some sometimes hard to
access<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:17.120> it's<00:03:18.120> also<00:03:18.330> hard<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:20.420> Titan

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
access and it's also hard to like Titan

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.380 
access and it's also hard to like Titan
but<00:03:23.280> they're<00:03:23.460> fixed<00:03:23.730> up<00:03:23.850> with<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.240> new

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
but they're fixed up with the new

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.290 
but they're fixed up with the new
version<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.870> cage<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.850> if<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.970> get<00:03:27.060> their

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
version of the cage so if you get their

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.870 
version of the cage so if you get their
cage<00:03:27.630> get<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.080> new<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.100> will<00:03:29.550> fix

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
cage get the new one because it will fix

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.480 
cage get the new one because it will fix
this<00:03:30.150> issue<00:03:30.650> another<00:03:31.650> issue<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.220> found

this issue another issue that I found

with the jag 35 for hdslr rig is the
place<00:03:36.420> where<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.020> base<00:03:37.380> plate<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:38.280> your

tripod or your tripod head connects to
the<00:03:42.530> actual<00:03:43.530> shouldering<00:03:44.300> if<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:45.540> too

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
the actual shouldering if you have too

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.110 
the actual shouldering if you have too
much<00:03:45.840> weight<00:03:46.110> on<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.500> rig<00:03:46.710> then<00:03:47.490> you<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.880> see

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
much weight on the rig then you can see

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.630 
much weight on the rig then you can see
a<00:03:48.150> lot<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.450> flex<00:03:48.840> as<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.650> see<00:03:49.860> here<00:03:50.160> that's

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
a lot of flex as you can see here that's

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.230 
a lot of flex as you can see here that's
why<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> don't<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:52.130> counterweight<00:03:53.130> on<00:03:53.310> at

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
why I don't have the counterweight on at

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.290 
why I don't have the counterweight on at
the<00:03:54.450> moment<00:03:55.190> Jack<00:03:56.190> 35<00:03:56.580> released<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.090> pro

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
the moment Jack 35 released a pro

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.160 
the moment Jack 35 released a pro
version<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:58.170> tripod<00:03:58.770> section<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> I'm

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
version of this tripod section so I'm

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.970 
version of this tripod section so I'm
going<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:02.100> eventually<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:04.680> I

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
going to eventually get it because I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.940 
going to eventually get it because I
don't<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.910> look<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:06.930> flex<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.530> mean

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
don't like the look of this flex I mean

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.470 
don't like the look of this flex I mean
I'm<00:04:08.070> sure<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:08.490> fine<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.360> after

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
I'm sure it's fine but I think after

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.450 
I'm sure it's fine but I think after
prolonged<00:04:10.760> flexing<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.650> plate<00:04:14.040> actually

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
prolonged flexing the the plate actually

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.170 
prolonged flexing the the plate actually
might<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:14.700> come<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.600> little<00:04:15.810> bit<00:04:15.960> weaker<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.940> so

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
might be come a little bit weaker but so

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.660 
might be come a little bit weaker but so
far<00:04:18.390> has<00:04:18.600> been<00:04:18.630> alright<00:04:19.250> but<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.280> will<00:04:20.489> be

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
far has been alright but I will be

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.159 
far has been alright but I will be
upgrading<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.299> new<00:04:21.390> tripod

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
upgrading to the new tripod

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.689 
upgrading to the new tripod
another<00:04:23.169> area<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.770> i<00:04:23.949> found<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.310> little<00:04:24.610> bit

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
another area that i found a little bit

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.920 
another area that i found a little bit
of<00:04:24.820> flex<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.199> offset<00:04:26.740> Rayloc<00:04:27.900> when<00:04:28.900> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
of flex is in the offset Rayloc when I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.990 
of flex is in the offset Rayloc when I
put<00:04:29.169> my<00:04:29.199> rig<00:04:29.500> down<00:04:29.759> especially<00:04:30.759> with<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
put my rig down especially with the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.029 
put my rig down especially with the
counterweight<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.990> can<00:04:32.139> see<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.440> flex<00:04:32.860> a

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
counterweight you can see it flex a

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.710 
counterweight you can see it flex a
little<00:04:33.160> bit<00:04:33.430> here<00:04:33.940> I'm<00:04:34.600> in<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.259> section<00:04:35.500> here

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
little bit here I'm in this section here

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.439 
little bit here I'm in this section here
but<00:04:37.720> it's<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.960> huge<00:04:38.259> flex<00:04:39.060> but<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.210> still

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
but it's not a huge flex but it's still

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.860 
but it's not a huge flex but it's still
there<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.500> think<00:04:42.039> a<00:04:42.130> way<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:43.570> I've<00:04:43.660> seen

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
there I think a way to that I've seen

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.490 
there I think a way to that I've seen
other<00:04:44.020> people<00:04:44.259> do<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.919> that<00:04:45.370> they've<00:04:45.550> put

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
other people do it is that they've put

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.170 
other people do it is that they've put
another<00:04:47.500> rail<00:04:48.009> block<00:04:48.280> here<00:04:48.520> just<00:04:49.030> to

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
another rail block here just to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.290 
another rail block here just to
strengthen<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.080> section<00:04:50.470> up<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.000> might

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
strengthen this section up so I might

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.909 
strengthen this section up so I might
end<00:04:52.449> up<00:04:52.600> doing<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.050> I'm<00:04:53.229> not<00:04:53.560> sure<00:04:53.620> at<00:04:53.889> this

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
end up doing that I'm not sure at this

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.900 
end up doing that I'm not sure at this
point<00:04:54.070> but<00:04:55.199> yeah<00:04:56.199> that's<00:04:56.350> something<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.910> be

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
point but yeah that's something to be

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.490 
point but yeah that's something to be
aware<00:04:57.940> of<00:04:58.180> if<00:04:58.419> you're<00:04:58.449> going<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:59.020> making<00:04:59.199> a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
aware of if you're going to be making a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.590 
aware of if you're going to be making a
fairly<00:04:59.889> heavy<00:05:00.100> ring<00:05:00.400> but<00:05:00.820> for<00:05:00.970> library<00:05:01.300> exists

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
fairly heavy ring but for library exists

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.439 
fairly heavy ring but for library exists
there<00:05:02.199> shouldn't<00:05:02.440> be<00:05:02.500> any<00:05:02.680> flex<00:05:03.010> at<00:05:03.220> all<00:05:03.449> but

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
there shouldn't be any flex at all but

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.779 
there shouldn't be any flex at all but
my<00:05:04.600> rig<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.229> fairly<00:05:05.500> heavy<00:05:05.800> with<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.010> cage<00:05:06.340> and

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
my rig is fairly heavy with the cage and

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.029 
my rig is fairly heavy with the cage and
the<00:05:07.210> quick-release<00:05:07.419> play<00:05:07.990> as<00:05:08.289> well<00:05:08.800> as<00:05:08.949> the

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
the quick-release play as well as the

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.360 
the quick-release play as well as the
camera<00:05:09.520> lenses<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.510> things<00:05:10.660> like<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.590> it

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
camera lenses and things like that so it

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.120 
camera lenses and things like that so it
depends<00:05:12.729> on<00:05:12.850> what<00:05:13.270> type<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.510> rig<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.960> have<00:05:14.139> one

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
depends on what type of rig you have one

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.520 
depends on what type of rig you have one
last<00:05:15.310> miner<00:05:15.669> con<00:05:15.970> with<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.870> shoulder<00:05:17.199> rig<00:05:17.349> is

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
last miner con with the shoulder rig is

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.029 
last miner con with the shoulder rig is
that<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:19.120> can<00:05:19.270> be<00:05:19.360> hard<00:05:19.630> at<00:05:19.750> times<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:20.620> lock<00:05:20.860> the

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
that it can be hard at times to lock the

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.249 
that it can be hard at times to lock the
wingnuts<00:05:21.430> down<00:05:21.639> completely<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.930> rail

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
wingnuts down completely so the rail

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.140 
wingnuts down completely so the rail
block<00:05:23.560> on<00:05:23.800> each<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.400> components<00:05:24.910> doesn't

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
block on each of the components doesn't

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.589 
block on each of the components doesn't
slide<00:05:25.440> on<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.620> rails<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:28.000> not<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.120> huge<00:05:28.389> issue

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
slide on the rails it's not a huge issue

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.529 
slide on the rails it's not a huge issue
at<00:05:28.990> times<00:05:29.260> but<00:05:29.770> if<00:05:30.370> you're<00:05:30.550> in<00:05:30.639> a<00:05:30.669> rush<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.240> it

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
at times but if you're in a rush and it

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.580 
at times but if you're in a rush and it
really<00:05:31.780> need<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.020> get<00:05:32.169> your<00:05:32.349> rig<00:05:33.099> ready<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.699> go

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
really need to get your rig ready to go

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.779 
really need to get your rig ready to go
you<00:05:35.590> need<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.860> spend<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.160> little<00:05:36.250> bit<00:05:36.370> more<00:05:36.550> time

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
you need to spend a little bit more time

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.870 
you need to spend a little bit more time
it<00:05:37.289> beforehand<00:05:38.289> to<00:05:39.280> lock<00:05:39.460> everything<00:05:39.729> down

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
it beforehand to lock everything down

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.730 
it beforehand to lock everything down
perfectly<00:05:40.479> I<00:05:40.750> think<00:05:41.229> this<00:05:41.349> just<00:05:41.470> might<00:05:41.560> be

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
perfectly I think this just might be

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.529 
perfectly I think this just might be
with<00:05:42.070> some<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.370> parts<00:05:42.669> that<00:05:42.699> i<00:05:42.849> have<00:05:43.060> since

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
with some of the parts that i have since

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.300 
with some of the parts that i have since
it<00:05:43.630> doesn't<00:05:43.780> happen<00:05:43.990> with<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.740> heart<00:05:45.130> with

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
it doesn't happen with the heart with

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.640 
it doesn't happen with the heart with
all<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.610> components<00:05:45.849> on<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.240> ring<00:05:46.419> but<00:05:47.080> it's

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
all the components on the ring but it's

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.620 
all the components on the ring but it's
just<00:05:47.860> something<00:05:48.099> to<00:05:48.190> be<00:05:48.280> wary<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.639> i<00:05:49.240> think

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
just something to be wary of i think

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.740 
just something to be wary of i think
this<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.020> something<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.590> be<00:05:50.650> wary<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.949> on<00:05:51.130> most

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
this is something to be wary of on most

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.210 
this is something to be wary of on most
rigs<00:05:52.750> that<00:05:52.870> involve<00:05:53.260> rail<00:05:53.590> systems<00:05:54.039> and

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
rigs that involve rail systems and

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.860 
rigs that involve rail systems and
things<00:05:54.310> like<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:55.510> should<00:05:55.720> make

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
things like that that you should make

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.480 
things like that that you should make
sure<00:05:56.080> that<00:05:56.260> everything<00:05:56.650> locks<00:05:56.889> down<00:05:57.070> really

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
sure that everything locks down really

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.510 
sure that everything locks down really
tightly<00:05:57.760> before<00:05:58.270> you<00:05:58.479> go<00:05:58.599> out<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.900> shoot<00:05:59.520> so

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
tightly before you go out and shoot so

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.189 
tightly before you go out and shoot so
yeah<00:06:00.669> it's<00:06:01.120> not<00:06:01.330> a<00:06:01.360> huge<00:06:01.570> thing<00:06:01.870> but<00:06:02.110> it's

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
yeah it's not a huge thing but it's

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.560 
yeah it's not a huge thing but it's
something<00:06:02.320> to<00:06:02.440> keep<00:06:03.070> in<00:06:03.190> mind<00:06:03.250> before<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:04.389> go

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
something to keep in mind before you go

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.510 
something to keep in mind before you go
out<00:06:04.720> shooting<00:06:04.990> with<00:06:05.229> a<00:06:05.260> rig<00:06:05.530> overall<00:06:06.310> after

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
out shooting with a rig overall after

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.520 
out shooting with a rig overall after
using<00:06:06.849> the<00:06:07.419> shoulder<00:06:07.870> rig<00:06:08.020> for<00:06:08.289> the<00:06:08.349> last

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
using the shoulder rig for the last

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.370 
using the shoulder rig for the last
several<00:06:08.770> months<00:06:08.979> I<00:06:09.280> really<00:06:10.180> like<00:06:10.389> it<00:06:10.630> it's<00:06:11.260> a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
several months I really like it it's a
