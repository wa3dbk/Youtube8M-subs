00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.800
 marwan 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.460
 is minimizing the risk of 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 cosmic radiation 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.820
 the planet Mars is at the point of 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.230
 Look at the mars one project apparently 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.180
 the main problems that you have to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.710
 solve seem to be the huge 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.930
 distance that you have to travel to 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.210
 get there the way to produce the air 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.920
 that colonists must breathe and 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.670
 find water to drink and produce 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.320
 foods 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.210
 the rest is shown to us as a 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 adventure in a desert planet so 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.409
 similar to the land that many areas 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.409
 of the planet could pass for terrestrial 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.930
 but it's not like that there is an invisible danger 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.570
 derived from the planet Mars not 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.000
 has magnetic field or at least not what 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.710
 it has as powerful as that of the earth and 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.710
 that danger are cosmic rays 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.540
 in our world the massive core of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.090
 iron that constitutes the center of 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.160
 steroid when turning on itself generates 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.140
 a strong magnetic field that 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.950
 extends up to several times the size of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.030
 the earth was discovered by the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.440
 Dutch scientist van alen in 1958 to 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 start the age of satellites 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.360
 artificial this field protects us from 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.550
 the bombing or rains of particles 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.610
 charged that come from both the sun 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.380
 as interplanetary space those 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.390
 magnetic belts attached to the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.730
 expression will not be terrestrial are the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.980
 security guarantee and finally the 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.930
 cause that on earth they have 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.340
 life blossomed 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.860
 On the contrary, Mars has no such 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 protection the magnetic field of Mars 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.990
 it is irregular and very weak its form is not 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.820
 uniform as the one on earth what 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.620
 causes the red planet does not 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.870
 find protected from the solar wind and 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.900
 of the cosmic rays as it is 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.000
 our planet Mars and the scarce not 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.210
 it will be Martian that provides a 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 pressure about 170 times lower than that of 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.470
 the land does not improve the situation 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.050
 since the protection that would give us would be 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.060
 almost nonexistent and it is not of little 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.840
 importance that this be so when you 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.840
 talk about colonize 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.590
 the cosmic rays come mostly 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
 from the center of our galaxy 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.930
 they are originally protons but at 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.150
 collide with the molecules of the atmosphere 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.129
 a great variety of other 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.310
 subatomic particles as pawns 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.930
 immune neutrinos these radiations are 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.629
 a danger for astronauts in the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.280
 few interplanetary trips have been 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.569
 seen exposed to them because the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.879
 Most trips 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.500
 carried out with crews have been 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.629
 done within the protection area of 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.780
 Van Allen belts and those 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.280
 zones the cosmic rays are very weak 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.519
 the biological impact of the rays 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.140
 cosmic manifests itself in two ways to 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.360
 short and long term if the doses of 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.099
 radiation are very high the damage that 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.709
 occurs in cells is immediate and 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.110
 death can result from this situation 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.400
 is not new in space travel and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.250
 during missions to 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 the beginning of the 70s the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.060
 astronauts were very close to 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.970
 receive lethal doses of cosmic media 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.490
 due to a solar flare 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.990
 they were lucky but had been in 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.940
 the surface of the moon at that time 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.460
 in a short time they would have developed 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 cancer and leukemia accompanied by 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.140
 symptoms such as dizziness, vomiting and dizziness 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.510
 but there is not only risk for 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.460
 crews electronic circuits 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.650
 they are very sensitive to the bombardment of these 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.870
 particles the energetic particles 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.660
 can ionize atoms and displace them 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.550
 within its crystalline structures it 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.560
 knows that the solar panels used by 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.140
 the waves to equip themselves with energy 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.080
 Electrical degrade rapidly under 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.520
 the effects of ionizing radiation 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.140
 the same way the fact that a 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.360
 particle traverses a micro circuit 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.100
 electronic can result in 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.290
 anomalous operation of the computer 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.740
 which is part with execution of orders 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.740
 wrong 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.000
 the current miniaturization of 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.860
 control systems aggravates this 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.390
 situation because every time it is necessary 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.050
 a smaller load to produce the effect 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.050
 unwanted 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.650
 seen all this we wonder what is 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.290
 the current state of systems 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.550
 protection in flight 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.410
 if we ignore the information 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.060
 supplied by the orbiter's equipment 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.450
 of lunar recognition of the nasa 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.310
 lr or apparently the researchers are 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.230
 testing samples of materials so 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.730
 lightweight like the plastic that 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.370
 provide effective protection 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.840
 against the dangers of radiation to the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.780
 that the astronauts are going to face 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.639
 during long space travel 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.770
 this research is doing every 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.940
 more necessary because now 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.100
 means of protection in the ships 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.110
 space were constituted by 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.780
 aluminum metallic layers with 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.870
 too much weight and not protection the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.580
 trip to Mars lasts six months during 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.710
 that time the crews can 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.060
 suffer not only the background radiation that 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.370
 comes from the core of our galaxy 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.529
 but there may be some eruption 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.449
 unforeseen solar 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.489
 when the shock wave reaches the 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.679
 vehicle in transit can not only 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:20.029
 affect the health of the crew 

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:21.529
 but it can spoil the systems of 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.089
 control of the ship preventing the 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:26.169
 operations in orbit and 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.169
 subsequent landing 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.230
 taking into account that the settlers 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.180
 will be there for life can 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.180
 endure the astronauts a radiation 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.750
 equivalent to about 50,000 radiographs 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.360
 to the year every year they spend the risk there 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.690
 of suffering from deadly cancer will increase in 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.470
 around 5% is not being condemned to 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:53.500
 these volunteers get sick quickly 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.550
 and so things are being valued in their 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.550
 just measure all this 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.600
 and arrived on Mars in case everything 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.430
 have passed without problems will be 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.590
 prepared the compartments to protect 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.350
 to the settlers or they will have to dedicate themselves to 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.720
 look for caves or build shelters 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.700
 underground if all the settlers are 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.130
 they raise the risk of suffering diseases 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.170
 aggressive this means that in a short time 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.670
 the colony will be formed by a team 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.790
 in deplorable situation 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.620
 and what to say about possible pregnancies 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.390
 with those radiation levels there 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.840
 will increase the risk of abortions and 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.000
 malformations in fetuses 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.740
 and we leave the questions and wait for the 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.740
 step of time to see the answers
