00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 so welcome back to another 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.310
 round league of legends I'm back 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.379
 on the pc server and play today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 time for you the new master or rather 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 said the rework from the crowd had changed 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.360
 some desired in my lucien 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.679
 gameplay video 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.170
 and then I thought I would come 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.480
 yesterday on the bws but just let's go 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.289
 now again marcel i has from 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 fundamentally completely changed 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.170
 also from the design you can already see here 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.449
 quite nice has been completely redesigned 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.710
 Every kid from Mars is completely different 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 from white I think very nice 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 they have really made great I think 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.070
 really good and then effective comdirect to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 Passive to do that and done a lot 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.899
 though the double strike if we have someone 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.180
 then attack runs that is so now times 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.149
 normal drive charged after 46 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 or our fourth attack then does 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.379
 a double beat the double beat 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 But it only does 50 harm that is us 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.539
 do with the additional strike 0 50% 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 our damage and yet another 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.570
 Special feature is when we go this day 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.890
 or even if we have two 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 we have only charges 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.710
 a certain amount of time for this blow 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.480
 trigger 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.000
 that means we have to be permanently in the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.860
 are fighting or perm attacks 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.180
 otherwise the sat runs 1 time 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.180
 back to normal and we can 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.920
 continue to use passive 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.479
 part of the football some 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 given changes and indeed they have 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.880
 completely gap scaling away and he 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.259
 Now chant with Eddie what else I have 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.189
 I do not know if that's great or not 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 Maybe that's a bit more 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.979
 worse film should 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.420
 because you can see very nice 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 blatantly with goodbye we have it now 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.490
 level 4 830 physicans with space 150 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 extra damage to monsters and through 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 our 121 hd we get 121 too 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.960
 hurt the alfa spree came yet 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.070
 tilt for additional physical 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 to inflict harm 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.350
 it just depends on our creed resists 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.720
 off and another special feature is that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.640
 our standard attacks of our basica 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.049
 tags reduce the cooler and this 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 easy strikes one second you 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.409
 see here has always when we attack 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.299
 he simply does not lose a second 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.579
 Kulant what I'm pretty blatant 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.290
 I have to say coach so yes you can 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.030
 keeps even more often the livescribe 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.250
 one sees already on hd the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.770
 makes quite good so yes if damage 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.149
 the village is or if the ob if the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.739
 maybe now just on ag 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600
 again with the q in all jump in 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.450
 I know 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.910
 because you have to wait for the second game 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.190
 and medicaid meditated is always 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.190
 still as before an aid from us 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.990
 Heal us that changed in 30 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.840
 hp per second for four seconds 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.600
 level 1 the cure is for everyone 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.430
 percent live that we lost around 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.990
 a percent increase means we have 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.210
 99 percent of lives lost is the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.280
 We have increased healing by 99 percent 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.990
 50 the hall is lost by 50 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 percent increase I do now too 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.970
 Because once also has from the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.270
 look a lot changed 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.290
 I think very cool looks very cool 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.270
 otherwise the damage is reduced 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.920
 on level individually we get by 40% 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.290
 At the highest level it is believed 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.620
 I far as I know 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.080
 70 or 80 percent of the damage 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.120
 is reduced is only halved 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.440
 Towards towers that means we can towers 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.760
 so do not think so easy anymore 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.230
 it was possible through the whole 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.610
 armor and magirus you got 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.210
 I think that in any case ever 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.280
 very cool 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.440
 so you can for the second to the third 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.050
 game that's still footboard we 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.970
 get permanent 9 on level 2 attack 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.520
 the match at the highest level is 15 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.890
 percent covers the human being we can the 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.630
 skill still enabled at bonus true 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.140
 damage for the next 5 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.880
 seconds 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.940
 that means we activate this ability 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.860
 make with every stroke similar to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.190
 like her elia you can say 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.990
 every time we hit it, we get an extra true image 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.610
 while this ability is on cologne 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.620
 we also lose the passive ability 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.670
 Say we lose our teeth tech 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.590
 the human being if the ability then 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.640
 is charged again our lights 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.630
 sword again and we get back 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.830
 Of course there are always 10 at equity 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.150
 Of course there are the highlander 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.740
 also some innovations 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.270
 the university now has a permanent one 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.040
 passive and always when we have one 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.970
 kill champion all decrease 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.920
 our cool down to 18 seconds all 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.630
 with an assist, ours decrease 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.910
 Cool at half way that's nine 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.770
 seconds so that's what I think 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.990
 So as I said I do not know 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.640
 if that is such a fat neff because 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.960
 before you had to hold this passive 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.250
 only if you have activated the ability 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.330
 and now you just have them permanently 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.260
 and you permanently reduce your art 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.370
 you have to see then of course there is 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.710
 still if we have the ability 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.780
 activate normally with speed expeed 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.860
 and immunity to movement reduction 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.719
 effect for ten seconds 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.770
 another special feature is if 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.020
 we kill a champion or 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.580
 assistance will not be our game as it is 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.020
 before was set back but we 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.460
 just get four seconds 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.439
 the raytion so speak to the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.939
 duration of the belt on it is called the 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.319
 Turnover for now let's say we 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.400
 Turks now receive a champion of ours 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.080
 Now three seconds later he stops 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.520
 after killing the temple 7 seconds 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.110
 So we can not do the skill 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.389
 again new active what I personally 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.039
 think so well because before it was yes 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.449
 Really so one is purely rammed has one 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.159
 killed camping again had the multi 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.090
 could then also skate or or could 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.539
 then again next time 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.460
 use 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.210
 So I think what it is now 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.469
 currently a lot better so yes 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.729
 otherwise there is really a lot 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.349
 not really much to say I 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.650
 can slaughter a little bit 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.789
 here 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.870
 try leona times to clarify na come 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:14.819
 now I let it slaughter here too 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.960
 you should already see foot here well there 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.319
 I'd say I'll show you now 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.599
 times the fashion and then water there too 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.430
 Almost again with the champion 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.419
 rework here 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.439
 while the monster I think mine 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.439
 shut up and you can see the cutscene 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.420
 a 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.969
 so you still get the recall now 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.969
 Of course I'll show you too 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.210
 Here and there I would say what has 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.759
 actually again today with the 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.710
 champion rework imagination with the 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.509
 champion riva imagination writes you 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.090
 the comments you got from the rhi factory 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.090
 from massy thinks you will find it op 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.110
 her now the balanced so I think 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.550
 I do not know what I think about it yet 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.810
 So if I look at me like that 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.310
 Much harm the crew does that is 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.690
 pretty neat when I feel 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.310
 because sometimes reinziehen he can quince 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.470
 and our culture becomes permanent 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.819
 reduced without us the ability 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.639
 yes I am still one 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.780
 bit skeptical but like yours said 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.009
 opinion is very important to me writes 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.020
 Definitely the comments on whether you 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.490
 you if you then permanent if you then 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.009
 play mass again more often or 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.039
 if you also think in adams 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.150
 ads are then played as I said 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.960
 just write everything in and then 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.099
 would tell us next time 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.330
 champions exhibition or you are looking 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.919
 just one of the other videos 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.060
 on our channel then wish you how 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.060
 always have fun and say ciao
