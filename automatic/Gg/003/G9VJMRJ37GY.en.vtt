 qualified workforce from France we can not look at each other anymore 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.339
 according to a recent survey carried out in May 2008 by the Observatory of 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.070
 building 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 and public works 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.550
 the btp and the most dynamic sector 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.510
 in terms of job creation 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.490
 however 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.420
 he has known for several years 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.859
 recruitment difficulties if the economic turbulence of the last few 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.080
 months can affect its growth 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.570
 he remains a carrier in the image of the family business albi 17 6 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.409
 founded by 1948 was installed 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:52.880
 in longeville-lès-saint-avold 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.170
 we employ forty people actually have fixed% of the business 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 and he made us we were raised by a dozen temporary workers this 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.810
 varies between periods of increased activity and rivers 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.530
 it's been five weeks since only 10 12 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.930
 the range of trades were very wide in the btp 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 and we offer multiple perspectives to those who 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.810
 who want to invest 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.829
 I think in the building actually a person who wants 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.720
 who is not afraid to work who wants to invest in e 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.680
 coraline panel of mercury ie the highest place 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.460
 to come into the trades that 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.570
 they are rather a lack of skilled labor motivate them the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.880
 troops and I think these are nice trades in the announced at 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.770
 current 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.810
 you think 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.410
 it is to say yesterday 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.190
 do you show the overbidding% 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 these thousands of officials the state of your achievements 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.740
 he even arrives at 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.140
 is that some people can not give their cool on projects in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.480
 saying you see what will not happen 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.900
 with some pride 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.660
 building companies must also anticipate 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.800
 to replenish their order book 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.050
 dynamism ehret activities 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.050
 these are the watchwords of this sector 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059
 we never stop we are always looking for new projects 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.159
 I know it's always a continuity we can never stop and 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.139
 rest on the job site will end 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.899
 it is necessary without stop with the 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:26.830
 commercial 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.830
 opposite in the field responds to calls for tenders 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.299
 building companies do not escape the recommendations of the grenelle de 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.409
 the environment 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.939
 they want to be more respectful 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.779
 in management 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.849
 garbage 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.090
 today it is no longer possible to put all the effort to go 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.799
 in landfills 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.029
 you need the leaders of the exchanges authorized 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.190
 but before material possibility of ammunition 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.859
 let's say percent did more than charge time in ten years retrieves them 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.500
 we hope it is for us poor people 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.960
 to crush them at the end of the season they are recycled and 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.819
 research on the building site is for us an economy 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.530
