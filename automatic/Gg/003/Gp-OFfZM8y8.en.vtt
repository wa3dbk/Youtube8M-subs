I<00:01:30.759> think<00:01:31.180> if<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.600> came<00:01:31.930> away<00:01:32.049> from<00:01:32.350> there

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
I think if we came away from there

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.130 
I think if we came away from there
feeling<00:01:32.890> hey<00:01:33.189> we're<00:01:34.180> real<00:01:34.390> real<00:01:34.600> cloaks<00:01:34.900> and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
feeling hey we're real real cloaks and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.080 
feeling hey we're real real cloaks and
so<00:01:35.860> I've<00:01:35.979> got<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.189> big<00:01:36.430> group<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.729> returning

so I've got a big group of returning
players<00:01:37.420> back<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.080> think<00:01:38.320> they're

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
players back and I think they're

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.590

hungrier<00:01:38.890> for<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.189> experience<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.270> think

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
hungrier for the experience and I think

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.030 
hungrier for the experience and I think
they're<00:01:40.780> confident<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.439> they<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.619> play<00:01:41.920> at
