specifically what we're practicing is
what<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.899> build<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> build<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
what to build and when to build it this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.610 
what to build and when to build it this
is<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.480> true<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:37.079> teryn<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is going to be for true for teryn and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.790 
is going to be for true for teryn and
obviously<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.190> beginners<00:00:39.000> okay<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.110> hope<00:00:40.710> it

over the next few days you need to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
over the next few days you need to
practice<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.040> same<00:01:35.250> build<00:01:35.549> order<00:01:35.880> over<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
practice the same build order over and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.429 
practice the same build order over and
over<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.950> over<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.110> slowly

over and over and you know slowly

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.410 
over and over and you know slowly
increase<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> capabilities<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> AI

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
increase the capabilities of the AI

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.139 
increase the capabilities of the AI
you're<00:01:42.869> playing<00:01:43.140> against<00:01:43.640> get<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.820> timing

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you're playing against get your timing

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.920 
you're playing against get your timing
down<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:45.899> hotkeys<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.780> as

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
down get your hotkeys down you know as

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
down get your hotkeys down you know as
I've<00:01:49.110> told<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.799> lots<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.130> people<00:01:50.399> before

I'm<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.450> good<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.720> Aaron<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.320> tend<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I'm not very good at Aaron I tend to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
I'm not very good at Aaron I tend to
play<00:01:52.950> protoss<00:01:53.369> alright<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.750> next<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.110> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
play protoss alright the next one of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
play protoss alright the next one of
these<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.740> we'll<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.430> going

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
these that we go over we'll be going

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.780 
these that we go over we'll be going
over<00:01:56.850> Protoss<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:59.030> the<00:02:00.030> whole<00:02:00.180> idea<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:01.790> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
over Protoss but the whole idea is to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.830 
over Protoss but the whole idea is to
get<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> optimum<00:02:03.570> use<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> our<00:02:04.799> resources

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
this build I kind of screw up a little

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.760 
this build I kind of screw up a little
bit<00:02:49.239> after<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.630> build<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:49.900> gas<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.410> forget<00:02:50.739> to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
bit after I build my gas I forget to

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.520 
bit after I build my gas I forget to
start<00:02:51.130> collecting<00:02:51.520> from<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.790> right<00:02:51.910> away<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
start collecting from it right away so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.070 
start collecting from it right away so
if<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.070> notice<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.430> puts<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:55.420> we'll<00:02:55.930> get

you<00:03:20.530> know<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.860> hotkey<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.580> though<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:21.760> don't<00:03:21.970> know

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
you know I hotkey it though I don't know

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.789 
you know I hotkey it though I don't know
if<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.299> notice<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:23.080> hockey<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:23.560> number

five so that you know I can flip back to

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.820 
five so that you know I can flip back to
it<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.239> know<00:03:28.360> later<00:03:28.600> on<00:03:28.690> just<00:03:29.530> by<00:03:29.650> hitting

201<00:03:33.720> all<00:03:34.720> right<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.769> SUV's<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.430> I'm<00:03:36.489> using

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
201 all right the SUV's that I'm using

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.000 
201 all right the SUV's that I'm using
to<00:03:36.910> build<00:03:37.090> with<00:03:37.480> their<00:03:37.900> hockey<00:03:38.350> for<00:03:38.650> two<00:03:38.860> and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
to build with their hockey for two and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.070 
to build with their hockey for two and
three<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.470> goes<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.860> say<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:43.080> learning

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
three so it goes to say that learning

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.250 
three so it goes to say that learning
views<00:03:44.260> your<00:03:44.410> hotkeys<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:45.070> important<00:03:46.260> learning

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
views your hotkeys is important learning

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.500 
views your hotkeys is important learning
your<00:03:47.290> build<00:03:47.590> order<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:49.209> know<00:03:49.299> as

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
your build order is you know as

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.340 
your build order is you know as
important<00:03:50.140> also<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:52.390> gives<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.750> foundation

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
important also it gives you a foundation

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.979 
important also it gives you a foundation
to<00:03:53.820> build<00:03:54.820> off<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:58.030> also<00:03:58.180> need<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.510> do<00:03:58.959> a

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
to build off of we also need to do a

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.570 
to build off of we also need to do a
little<00:03:59.170> bit<00:03:59.350> of<00:03:59.380> scouting<00:03:59.700> to<00:04:00.700> know<00:04:00.850> add<00:04:02.580> you

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
little bit of scouting to know add you

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.830 
little bit of scouting to know add you
know<00:04:03.670> close<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.239> end<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.570> build

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
know close to the end of this build
