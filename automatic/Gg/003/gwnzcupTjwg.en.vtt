welcome to a cinema 4d tutorial and
today<00:00:14.099> I'm<00:00:14.250> gonna<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.549> showing<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.969> how<00:00:15.000> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
today I'm gonna be showing you how to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.210 
today I'm gonna be showing you how to
turn<00:00:15.480> any<00:00:15.780> object<00:00:16.230> into<00:00:18.080> this<00:00:19.080> mesh<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:19.800> grid

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
turn any object into this mesh or grid

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.019 
turn any object into this mesh or grid
effect<00:00:21.560> put<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.859> examples<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
effect put some examples here for you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
effect put some examples here for you
I've<00:00:24.390> got<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:25.170> cube<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:26.119> sphere<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:28.080> I've<00:00:28.289> also

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
I've got a cube a sphere and I've also

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
I've got a cube a sphere and I've also
got<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.449> text<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.610> with

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
got some text and you can do this with

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.069 
got some text and you can do this with
any<00:00:32.969> object<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:34.910> physical<00:00:36.079> 3d

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
any object which has physical 3d

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.450 
any object which has physical 3d
geometry<00:00:38.000> okay<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> let's<00:00:40.320> take<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.370> at

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
geometry okay so let's take a look at

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.229 
geometry okay so let's take a look at
how<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.680> if<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.129> cube<00:00:44.640> for

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
how we do this if I get a cube for

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.950 
how we do this if I get a cube for
example<00:00:46.190> let's<00:00:47.190> push<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> segment<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
example let's push up the segment to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.060 
example let's push up the segment to
five<00:00:49.590> by<00:00:49.950> five<00:00:50.219> by<00:00:50.460> five<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.739> it's<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.890> simple

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
five by five by five and it's as simple

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
five by five by five and it's as simple
as<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.850> re<00:00:54.090> icon<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> getting

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
as going to the re icon and getting

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
as going to the re icon and getting
there<00:00:55.620> atum-ra<00:00:55.980> -<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.739> put<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.399> to<00:01:00.020> put

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
there atum-ra - and put this in to put

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
there atum-ra - and put this in to put
your<00:01:01.140> cube<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> atom<00:01:02.309> array<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.390> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
your cube into the atom array and you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.310 
your cube into the atom array and you
will<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:06.830> screen<00:01:07.830> effect<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:10.170> can

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
will get this screen effect and you can

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.780 
will get this screen effect and you can
go<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> cylinder<00:01:11.159> radius<00:01:11.520> which

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
go to the cylinder radius which

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.780 
go to the cylinder radius which
basically<00:01:12.150> means<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.720> width<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:14.549> lines

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
basically means the width of the lines

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
basically means the width of the lines
and<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> sphere<00:01:17.159> radius

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and you also have the sphere radius

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.830 
and you also have the sphere radius
which<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.920> size<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.400> joints<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
which is the size of this joints so if I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.800 
which is the size of this joints so if I
set<00:01:22.110> both<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.810> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
set both of this to one and one that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
set both of this to one and one that
looks<00:01:24.869> pretty<00:01:25.229> good<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.880> also<00:01:27.090> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
looks pretty good and you also have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
looks pretty good and you also have
subdivisions<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:31.100> depending<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.159> how<00:01:32.340> soft

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
subdivisions and depending on how soft

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
subdivisions and depending on how soft
you<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.299> look<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:33.780> Jack<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you want this to look or how Jack that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.039 
you want this to look or how Jack that
you<00:01:34.320> wanted<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> look<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.310> adjust<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
you wanted to look you can adjust it

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.810 
you wanted to look you can adjust it
accordingly

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
accordingly

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.300 
accordingly
whatever<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> threes<00:01:39.689> divisions<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
whatever that threes divisions and I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
whatever that threes divisions and I
will<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> cylinder<00:01:42.360> radius<00:01:42.750> set<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
will go to the cylinder radius set it to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 
will go to the cylinder radius set it to
not<00:01:43.829> point<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.079> sphere<00:01:46.350> radius<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
not point one and the sphere radius to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.320 
not point one and the sphere radius to
not<00:01:47.369> point<00:01:47.939> one

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
not point one

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.930 
not point one
so<00:01:50.020> we<00:01:50.410> end<00:01:50.680> up<00:01:50.830> with<00:01:51.300> this<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:54.160> find<00:01:54.790> this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
so we end up with this and I find this

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.990 
so we end up with this and I find this
looks<00:01:55.150> pretty<00:01:55.330> cool<00:01:55.570> if<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.810> get<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:56.260> material

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
looks pretty cool if you get a material

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.400 
looks pretty cool if you get a material
switch<00:01:58.000> off<00:01:58.180> all<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.420> channels<00:01:58.780> except<00:01:59.260> for

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
switch off all the channels except for

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.510 
switch off all the channels except for
the<00:01:59.500> luminance<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.300> drop<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
the luminance and drop this on and I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.120 
the luminance and drop this on and I
think<00:02:03.580> I<00:02:03.850> looks<00:02:04.060> pretty<00:02:04.480> cool<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.170> if<00:02:05.950> I

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
think I looks pretty cool and if I

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.830 
think I looks pretty cool and if I
remove<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.550> cube<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.150> get<00:02:07.510> any<00:02:07.660> other

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
remove the cube I can get any other

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.910 
remove the cube I can get any other
shape<00:02:08.080> such<00:02:08.560> as<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:09.130> platonic<00:02:10.350> drop<00:02:11.350> this<00:02:11.560> into

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
shape such as a platonic drop this into

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.190 
shape such as a platonic drop this into
here<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:13.050> instant<00:02:14.070> mesh<00:02:15.330> okay<00:02:16.330> let's<00:02:16.930> take<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
here and instant mesh okay let's take a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.810 
here and instant mesh okay let's take a
look<00:02:17.440> at<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.710> do<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.130> with<00:02:18.570> text<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
look at how we do this with text so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.030 
look at how we do this with text so
either<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:22.270> more<00:02:22.810> graph<00:02:23.110> text<00:02:23.770> or<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:26.040> you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
either it's more graph text or it's you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.080 
either it's more graph text or it's you
know<00:02:27.070> both<00:02:27.420> text<00:02:28.420> made<00:02:28.900> from<00:02:29.140> spines<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
know both text made from spines the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.570 
know both text made from spines the
procedure<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.570> same<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:33.070> I'm<00:02:33.130> gonna<00:02:33.280> type

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
procedure is the same so I'm gonna type

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.680 
procedure is the same so I'm gonna type
in<00:02:33.820> mushy<00:02:34.570> Phi<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:38.610> let's<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:40.000> extrude<00:02:40.660> NURBS

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
in mushy Phi and let's get extrude NURBS

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.450 
in mushy Phi and let's get extrude NURBS
and<00:02:41.290> drop<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.070> into<00:02:42.520> here<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.710> that's<00:02:45.190> maybe

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
and drop this into here and that's maybe

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.870 
and drop this into here and that's maybe
increase<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.240> depth<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.870> 35<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.580> I'm<00:02:48.730> gonna

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
increase the depth to 35 and I'm gonna

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.590 
increase the depth to 35 and I'm gonna
keep<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.120> font<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:50.500> same<00:02:51.060> okay<00:02:52.060> let's<00:02:52.330> say

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
keep that font the same okay let's say

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.760 
keep that font the same okay let's say
drop<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.320> into<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.489> autumn<00:02:54.820> RA<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.770> let's

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
drop this into the autumn RA and let's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.660 
drop this into the autumn RA and let's
see<00:02:57.040> what<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.430> have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
see what we have

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.630 
see what we have
maybe<00:02:58.540> I've<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.350> cylinder<00:02:59.830> radius<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.430> not

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
maybe I've just a cylinder radius to not

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.510 
maybe I've just a cylinder radius to not
point<00:03:00.910> one<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.500> sphere<00:03:02.739> radius<00:03:02.890> two<00:03:03.340> also

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
point one and the sphere radius two also

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.030 
point one and the sphere radius two also
to<00:03:03.820> not<00:03:04.330> point<00:03:04.630> one<00:03:05.910> drop<00:03:06.910> our<00:03:07.090> material<00:03:07.570> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
to not point one drop our material and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.110 
to not point one drop our material and
if<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.160> render<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.850> get<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:11.130> now<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.850> looks

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
if I render I get this now this looks

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.720 
if I render I get this now this looks
pretty<00:03:13.239> cool<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:14.080> what<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:15.130> I'm<00:03:15.280> an<00:03:15.430> equal

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
pretty cool but what if I'm an equal

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.470 
pretty cool but what if I'm an equal
distribution<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:16.920> blocks<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:19.030> example

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
distribution of blocks like the example

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.350 
distribution of blocks like the example
which<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.690> showed<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.930> at<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.590> beginning

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
which I showed you at the beginning

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.310 
which I showed you at the beginning
there's<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.709> few<00:03:23.709> steps<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.610> take<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:25.270> get<00:03:26.260> to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
there's a few steps of to take to get to

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.240 
there's a few steps of to take to get to
that<00:03:26.500> point<00:03:27.540> first<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.690> all<00:03:28.870> let's<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:29.380> shut

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
that point first of all let's just shut

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.410 
that point first of all let's just shut
this<00:03:30.400> off<00:03:30.580> I'm<00:03:30.910> gonna<00:03:31.030> go<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:32.910> options<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.209> set

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
this off I'm gonna go to options and set

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.750 
this off I'm gonna go to options and set
layer<00:03:34.750> color<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:36.130> I'll<00:03:36.220> be<00:03:36.370> seeing<00:03:36.640> the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
layer color so I'll be seeing the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.240 
layer color so I'll be seeing the
default<00:03:37.180> gray<00:03:37.480> tone<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.590> then<00:03:38.680> when<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:38.860> finish

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
default gray tone and then when I finish

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.030 
default gray tone and then when I finish
I<00:03:39.520> will<00:03:39.670> go<00:03:40.000> back<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:41.320> normal<00:03:41.530> color

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
I will go back to the normal color

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.339 
I will go back to the normal color
okay<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.150> first<00:03:45.599> thing<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:45.989> need<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> do

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
okay so the first thing you need to do

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.210 
okay so the first thing you need to do
is<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.590> add<00:03:46.769> segments<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.640> around<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:50.040> each

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
is to add segments going around on each

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.610 
is to add segments going around on each
letter<00:03:50.599> we<00:03:51.599> basically<00:03:51.930> want<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.260> distribute

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
letter we basically want to distribute

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.539 
letter we basically want to distribute
this<00:03:52.829> equal<00:03:53.489> intervals<00:03:53.879> right<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.239> we<00:03:55.110> have

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
this equal intervals right now we have

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.030 
this equal intervals right now we have
the<00:03:56.549> more<00:03:56.790> curved<00:03:57.090> areas<00:03:57.480> have<00:03:58.319> more<00:03:58.349> segments

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the more curved areas have more segments

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.059 
the more curved areas have more segments
and<00:03:59.220> Australia<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.480> no<00:04:00.870> segments<00:04:01.349> which

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
and Australia is have no segments which

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.660 
and Australia is have no segments which
would<00:04:02.549> make<00:04:02.730> sense<00:04:02.909> this<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.299> an<00:04:03.480> adaptive

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
would make sense this is an adaptive

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.300 
would make sense this is an adaptive
method<00:04:05.670> which<00:04:05.819> we're<00:04:06.329> using<00:04:06.360> right<00:04:06.840> now<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.950> we

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
method which we're using right now if we

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.910 
method which we're using right now if we
set<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:09.000> intermediate<00:04:09.750> points<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.379> uniform

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
set this intermediate points to uniform

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.670 
set this intermediate points to uniform
this<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.549> in<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.879> object<00:04:12.329> area<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.349> spine

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
this is in the object area of the spine

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.550 
this is in the object area of the spine
text<00:04:14.390> set<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.599> uniform<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.350> put<00:04:16.470> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
text set it to uniform and put the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.789 
text set it to uniform and put the
number<00:04:16.889> two<00:04:17.100> something<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:17.459> 12<00:04:18.620> when<00:04:19.620> we

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
number two something like 12 when we

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.560 
number two something like 12 when we
click<00:04:20.070> pattern<00:04:20.250> extreme<00:04:20.699> labs<00:04:20.940> we<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.479> now

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
click pattern extreme labs we can now

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.990 
click pattern extreme labs we can now
see<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.109> we<00:04:22.320> have<00:04:22.560> an<00:04:22.860> equal<00:04:23.820> distribution

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
see that we have an equal distribution

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.080 
see that we have an equal distribution
of<00:04:26.600> segments<00:04:27.600> across<00:04:28.320> all<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.620> letters<00:04:29.090> some

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
of segments across all the letters some

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.270 
of segments across all the letters some
letters<00:04:30.389> like<00:04:30.539> the<00:04:30.720> S<00:04:30.870> which<00:04:31.320> are<00:04:31.650> generally

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
letters like the S which are generally

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.270 
letters like the S which are generally
more<00:04:32.970> curved<00:04:33.360> than<00:04:33.510> others<00:04:33.960> still<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.039> lot

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
more curved than others still have a lot

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.580 
more curved than others still have a lot
more<00:04:35.310> segments<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:37.139> looks<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.470> lot

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
more segments but this looks a lot

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.490 
more segments but this looks a lot
better<00:04:37.860> than<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.639> did<00:04:39.229> just<00:04:40.229> on<00:04:40.729> adaptive<00:04:42.500> so

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
better than it did just on adaptive so

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.089 
better than it did just on adaptive so
let's<00:04:43.889> set<00:04:44.699> this<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.910> uniform<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.410> maybe<00:04:46.740> just

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
let's set this to uniform and maybe just

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.600 
let's set this to uniform and maybe just
eight<00:04:47.340> segments<00:04:47.970> will<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:49.250> it<00:04:50.250> just<00:04:50.460> reduces

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
eight segments will do it just reduces

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.689 
eight segments will do it just reduces
the<00:04:51.060> number<00:04:51.389> so<00:04:52.380> that's<00:04:52.620> one<00:04:52.889> set<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.220> segments

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
the number so that's one set of segments

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.170 
the number so that's one set of segments
the<00:04:54.090> other<00:04:54.570> set<00:04:54.900> needs<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.199> be<00:04:55.289> going<00:04:55.650> down<00:04:56.180> so

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
the other set needs to be going down so

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.790 
the other set needs to be going down so
instead<00:04:57.479> of<00:04:57.539> having<00:04:57.690> long<00:04:58.050> rectangles<00:04:58.680> we

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
instead of having long rectangles we

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.920 
instead of having long rectangles we
want<00:04:59.039> smaller<00:04:59.400> squares<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:01.070> for<00:05:02.070> this<00:05:02.250> we<00:05:02.930> go

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
want smaller squares and for this we go

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.800 
want smaller squares and for this we go
to<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.169> extrude<00:05:04.470> NURBS<00:05:04.500> itself<00:05:05.539> go<00:05:06.539> to<00:05:06.599> the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
to the extrude NURBS itself go to the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.990 
to the extrude NURBS itself go to the
object<00:05:06.960> tab<00:05:07.349> and<00:05:07.680> set<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.160> subdivision<00:05:08.729> to

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
object tab and set the subdivision to

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.460 
object tab and set the subdivision to
five<00:05:10.280> or<00:05:11.360> higher<00:05:12.360> just<00:05:12.750> depending<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.260> your

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
five or higher just depending on your

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.129 
five or higher just depending on your
scene<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.460> think<00:05:15.240> service<00:05:15.479> but<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.780> work<00:05:15.930> pretty

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
scene I think service but I work pretty

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.710 
scene I think service but I work pretty
good<00:05:16.229> for<00:05:16.410> me<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:16.940> now<00:05:17.940> we<00:05:18.000> have<00:05:18.270> segments

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
good for me so now we have segments

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.040 
good for me so now we have segments
going<00:05:19.020> back<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.220> lastly<00:05:21.210> we<00:05:21.389> need<00:05:21.419> segments

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
going back and lastly we need segments

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.290 
going back and lastly we need segments
on<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.410> individual<00:05:23.010> faces<00:05:23.699> because<00:05:24.060> if<00:05:24.180> I

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
on the individual faces because if I

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.909 
on the individual faces because if I
enable<00:05:24.539> at<00:05:24.840> Marea<00:05:25.229> right<00:05:25.409> now

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
enable at Marea right now

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.570 
enable at Marea right now
and<00:05:26.180> do<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.479> render<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.889> can<00:05:29.070> see<00:05:29.250> we<00:05:29.460> have

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
and do a render you can see we have

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.740 
and do a render you can see we have
something<00:05:29.789> which<00:05:29.970> looks<00:05:30.210> pretty<00:05:30.419> cool

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
something which looks pretty cool

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.219 
something which looks pretty cool
actually

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
actually

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.210 
actually
but<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:32.490> know<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:32.639> may<00:05:32.820> want<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.030> close<00:05:33.240> up

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
but you know you may want to close up

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.670 
but you know you may want to close up
the<00:05:35.220> front<00:05:35.430> faces<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.840> back<00:05:36.990> faces<00:05:37.409> too

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
the front faces and the back faces too

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.730 
the front faces and the back faces too
so<00:05:38.639> for<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.240> we<00:05:40.340> go<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.940> caps<00:05:42.210> tab<00:05:42.740> the

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
so for this we go to the caps tab the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.270 
so for this we go to the caps tab the
start<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.580> end<00:05:45.320> you<00:05:46.320> can<00:05:46.470> add<00:05:46.680> a<00:05:46.710> Phillip

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
start and the end you can add a Phillip

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.020 
start and the end you can add a Phillip
cap<00:05:47.490> if<00:05:47.760> you<00:05:47.970> wish

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
cap if you wish

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.290 
cap if you wish
that<00:05:49.360> adds<00:05:49.570> this<00:05:50.560> cap<00:05:50.860> this<00:05:51.310> beveled<00:05:51.760> edge<00:05:51.940> at

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
that adds this cap this beveled edge at

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.630 
that adds this cap this beveled edge at
the<00:05:52.420> front<00:05:52.660> and<00:05:52.840> at<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:52.960> back<00:05:53.340> but<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.460> may<00:05:54.580> be

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
the front and at the back but it may be

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.550 
the front and at the back but it may be
lower<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.090> radius<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:55.810> 2<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.710> 2<00:05:56.950> and<00:05:58.560> that

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
lower the radius to 2 and 2 and that

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.440 
lower the radius to 2 and 2 and that
will<00:05:59.800> create<00:06:00.580> an<00:06:01.180> interesting<00:06:01.740> edge<00:06:02.740> but<00:06:03.640> if

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
will create an interesting edge but if

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.470 
will create an interesting edge but if
you<00:06:04.630> want<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:05.230> have<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.650> whole<00:06:05.830> face

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
you want to have the whole face

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.390 
you want to have the whole face
subdivided<00:06:07.480> you<00:06:08.110> go<00:06:08.290> to<00:06:08.350> down<00:06:08.890> here<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.370> says

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
subdivided you go to down here it says

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.590 
subdivided you go to down here it says
type<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.270> set<00:06:11.110> these<00:06:11.290> two<00:06:12.000> triangles<00:06:13.000> and

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
type and set these two triangles and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.560 
type and set these two triangles and
then<00:06:14.050> regular<00:06:14.590> grid<00:06:15.130> and<00:06:15.370> then<00:06:16.120> lower<00:06:16.360> this

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
then regular grid and then lower this

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.980 
then regular grid and then lower this
number<00:06:16.630> by<00:06:17.500> default<00:06:17.950> it's<00:06:18.220> 10<00:06:18.630> let's<00:06:19.630> bring<00:06:19.840> it

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
number by default it's 10 let's bring it

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.880 
number by default it's 10 let's bring it
down<00:06:20.200> to<00:06:20.440> maybe<00:06:20.620> 3<00:06:21.250> and<00:06:22.180> when<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.390> do<00:06:22.510> that<00:06:22.890> the

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
down to maybe 3 and when I do that the

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.190 
down to maybe 3 and when I do that the
front<00:06:24.340> surfaces<00:06:24.850> are<00:06:24.970> gonna<00:06:25.120> have<00:06:25.390> subdivided

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
front surfaces are gonna have subdivided

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.510 
front surfaces are gonna have subdivided
that<00:06:26.380> face<00:06:27.010> is<00:06:27.250> like<00:06:28.090> this<00:06:28.690> and<00:06:28.990> the<00:06:29.740> same<00:06:30.010> at

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
that face is like this and the same at

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.230 
that face is like this and the same at
the<00:06:30.730> back<00:06:30.960> so<00:06:31.960> now<00:06:31.990> when<00:06:32.470> I<00:06:32.500> render<00:06:33.210> with<00:06:34.210> the

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
the back so now when I render with the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.070 
the back so now when I render with the
item<00:06:34.690> array<00:06:34.960> switched<00:06:35.260> on<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:36.720> have<00:06:37.720> the<00:06:37.900> whole

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
item array switched on I have the whole

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.210 
item array switched on I have the whole
thing<00:06:38.160> turned<00:06:39.160> into<00:06:39.400> a<00:06:39.550> mesh<00:06:39.940> or<00:06:40.330> grid<00:06:41.260> effect

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
thing turned into a mesh or grid effect

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.180 
thing turned into a mesh or grid effect
and<00:06:42.910> that's<00:06:43.450> it<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:43.900> how<00:06:44.080> you<00:06:44.190> measure

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
and that's it that is how you measure

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.110 
and that's it that is how you measure
