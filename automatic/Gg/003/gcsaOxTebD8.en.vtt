Richard<00:00:32.520> before<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.059> started<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
Richard before you really started to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.840

feel comfortable in ice dancing uh I

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
feel comfortable in ice dancing uh I
guess<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.480> took<00:00:39.690> almost<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.410> whole<00:00:40.530> year

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
guess it took almost the whole year

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010
