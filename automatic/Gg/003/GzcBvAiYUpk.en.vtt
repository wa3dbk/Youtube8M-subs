that<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:56.349> don't<00:01:56.529> want<00:01:56.709> to<00:01:56.799> clean<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.069> fold<00:01:57.279> I'd

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
that I don't want to clean the fold I'd

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.219

rather bet and get called sure now it
ends<00:01:59.349> up<00:01:59.529> being<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.889> it's<00:02:00.849> gotten<00:02:01.090> an

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
ends up being that it's gotten an

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.459 
ends up being that it's gotten an
incredible<00:02:01.630> amount<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.840> action<00:02:02.139> I<00:02:02.169> guess<00:02:02.319> you

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
incredible amount of action I guess you

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.529 
incredible amount of action I guess you
price<00:02:02.950> out<00:02:03.159> drawers<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.849> like<00:02:04.029> the<00:02:04.240> advantage
