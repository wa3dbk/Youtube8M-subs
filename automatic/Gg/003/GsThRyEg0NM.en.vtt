00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
hey what's up guys and here's a video my

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.789 
hey what's up guys and here's a video my
forklift<00:00:05.160> I've<00:00:05.370> got<00:00:06.170> it<00:00:07.170> was<00:00:07.290> having<00:00:07.500> an<00:00:07.649> issue

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
forklift I've got it was having an issue

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.530 
forklift I've got it was having an issue
with<00:00:08.300> taking<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> while<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.599> go<00:00:10.019> forward<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
with taking a while to go forward and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.259 
with taking a while to go forward and
backwards<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.929> hold<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.349> gas<00:00:14.269> you

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
backwards you have to hold the gas you

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.970 
backwards you have to hold the gas you
know<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> switch<00:00:16.139> right<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.740> mana

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
know on the switch right here the mana

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.730 
know on the switch right here the mana
whatever<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> heck<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.029> called<00:00:18.380> mana<00:00:19.380> troll

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
whatever the heck is called mana troll

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
whatever the heck is called mana troll
switch<00:00:20.130> whatever<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.810> sit<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
switch whatever and just sit there and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.950 
switch whatever and just sit there and
wait<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.850> would<00:00:23.939> finally<00:00:24.480> after<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
wait and then it would finally after a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.220 
wait and then it would finally after a
while<00:00:25.170> start<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.859> moving<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:28.140> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
while start to get moving and I think it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.980 
while start to get moving and I think it
was<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> pressures<00:00:29.279> were<00:00:29.429> real<00:00:29.640> low

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
was because the pressures were real low

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
was because the pressures were real low
because<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> inching<00:00:31.679> valve<00:00:32.000> was<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.149> guess

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
because of the inching valve was I guess

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.229 
because of the inching valve was I guess
bypassing<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> pressure<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> clutches<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
bypassing the pressure to the clutches I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.430 
bypassing the pressure to the clutches I
was<00:00:36.960> only<00:00:37.110> getting<00:00:37.260> 70<00:00:37.710> psi<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> gauges<00:00:39.440> on

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
was only getting 70 psi on the gauges on

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600 
was only getting 70 psi on the gauges on
the<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> test<00:00:41.489> port<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:43.020> two<00:00:43.350> test<00:00:44.100> port<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the to a test port the two test port I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330 
the to a test port the two test port I
was<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:45.030> 90<00:00:45.450> psi<00:00:46.020> 90<00:00:46.530> 100<00:00:46.980> something<00:00:47.190> like

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
was get 90 psi 90 100 something like

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.750 
was get 90 psi 90 100 something like
that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020 
that
so<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.690> good<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> other<00:00:49.879> on<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so that was good but on the other on the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.319 
so that was good but on the other on the
-<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> gauge<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.899> getting<00:00:52.079> 70<00:00:52.440> psi<00:00:53.059> but<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
- a gauge I was getting 70 psi but I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.229 
- a gauge I was getting 70 psi but I
took<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.809> engine<00:00:55.230> valve<00:00:55.469> apart<00:00:55.940> which<00:00:56.940> was

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
took the engine valve apart which was

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.340 
took the engine valve apart which was
211<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:59.489> plate<00:00:59.820> comes<00:01:00.090> off<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
211 this plate comes off and then the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.850 
211 this plate comes off and then the
spring<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:03.019> there's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> couple<00:01:04.229> springs<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
spring and a there's a couple springs in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
spring and a there's a couple springs in
a<00:01:04.920> rubber<00:01:05.129> washer<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.299> double<00:01:07.110> spring<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a rubber washer and a double spring and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.219 
a rubber washer and a double spring and
a<00:01:07.650> shaft<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:09.000> there's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.659> guess<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
a shaft and then there's a I guess a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.030 
a shaft and then there's a I guess a
metering<00:01:10.710> valve<00:01:12.409> tube<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.920> what

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
metering valve tube I don't know what

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.910 
metering valve tube I don't know what
you<00:01:14.159> call<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.570> between<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.680> side

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you call it that's in between this side

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
you call it that's in between this side
of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.100> engine<00:01:17.280> valve<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> side

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
of the engine valve and that side

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
of the engine valve and that side
there's<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> 19<00:01:20.509> bolt<00:01:21.509> or<00:01:22.460> plug<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.700> whatever

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
there's a 19 bolt or plug or whatever

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.890 
there's a 19 bolt or plug or whatever
that<00:01:24.000> comes<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.509> there's<00:01:24.689> another

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that comes out and there's another

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.359 
that comes out and there's another
spring<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.450> shaft<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.750> whatever<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.920> pushes

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
spring and shaft or whatever that pushes

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.230 
spring and shaft or whatever that pushes
that<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.490> inching<00:01:32.850> valve

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that the inching valve

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.929 
that the inching valve
I<00:01:33.360> guess<00:01:33.750> left<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.790> opening<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I guess left and right opening up the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.240 
I guess left and right opening up the
ports<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> inside<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> transmission<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ports and inside the transmission to the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.719 
ports and inside the transmission to the
clutches<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.310> taken<00:01:41.549> out

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
clutches and so so I got that taken out

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.560 
clutches and so so I got that taken out
stuck<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:43.259> side<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.270> wouldn't<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
stuck on this side I wouldn't it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.170 
stuck on this side I wouldn't it
wouldn't<00:01:45.750> come<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> had<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> put<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
wouldn't come on down I had to put it on

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
wouldn't come on down I had to put it on
extension<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> 3/8<00:01:49.890> ratchet

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
extension in there from a 3/8 ratchet

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
extension in there from a 3/8 ratchet
and<00:01:50.579> Hammer<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.780> popped<00:01:52.079> out<00:01:52.229> tapped

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and Hammer it and it popped out tapped

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.149 
and Hammer it and it popped out tapped
it<00:01:52.890> lightly<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.250> didn't<00:01:53.520> blast<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
it lightly I didn't blast it so

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.170 
it lightly I didn't blast it so
eventually<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.490> worked<00:01:56.610> its<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:56.939> loose

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
eventually it worked its way loose

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.179 
eventually it worked its way loose
pulled<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.719> cleaned<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:59.159> some

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
pulled it out cleaned it up put some

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.840 
pulled it out cleaned it up put some
hydraulic<00:01:59.759> fluid<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> o-rings<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.850> then

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
hydraulic fluid on the o-rings and then

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.440 
hydraulic fluid on the o-rings and then
reinstalled<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:04.890> kind<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.219> pain

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
reinstalled it and I was kind of a pain

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.550 
reinstalled it and I was kind of a pain
coming<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.750> easy<00:02:06.960> because<00:02:07.229> everything

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
coming out was easy because everything

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
coming out was easy because everything
was<00:02:07.649> binded<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.369> its<00:02:08.729> spring<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.539> but

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
was binded up and its spring out but
