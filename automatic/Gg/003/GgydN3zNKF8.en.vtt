the<00:00:36.420> defenders<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.140> obviously<00:00:37.379> because

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the defenders not but obviously because

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.729 
the defenders not but obviously because
it's<00:00:37.679> a<00:00:37.739> striker<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:39.239> passing<00:00:39.839> is<00:00:40.019> 83
