00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
however the functionality of the routing

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.959 
however the functionality of the routing
system<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.960> important<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.039> wait<00:00:53.309> six

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
system is important and if you wait six

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.080 
system is important and if you wait six
months<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.570> mess<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.730> there's<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> chance

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
months to mess with it there's a chance

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
months to mess with it there's a chance
that<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.690> dirty<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that it's going to get dirty or it's you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
that it's going to get dirty or it's you
know<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> memory<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> webbing

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
know you get a memory on the webbing

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
know you get a memory on the webbing
itself<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.399> bottom<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
itself of the of the the bottom of the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
itself of the of the the bottom of the
three<00:01:03.449> ring<00:01:03.629> assembly<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.769> riser<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
three ring assembly on the riser and so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
three ring assembly on the riser and so
it<00:01:05.909> may<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.210> release<00:01:06.450> correctly<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it may not release correctly so the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020 
it may not release correctly so the
truth<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.580> pull<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
truth is you don't have to pull the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
truth is you don't have to pull the
cutaway<00:01:09.360> handle<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.590 
that attaches in that system yeah it's
it's<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:47.130> necessary<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:48.180> most<00:01:48.360> cases

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it's really not necessary in most cases

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
it's really not necessary in most cases
but<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> event<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.700> side

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
but in the event that the right side

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.350 
but in the event that the right side
where<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> RSL<00:01:52.170> attachment<00:01:53.100> point<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.549> goes

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
where the RSL attachment point is goes

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.289 
where the RSL attachment point is goes
first<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.640> you're<00:01:56.640> still<00:01:56.850> attached<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
first then you're still attached on the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
first then you're still attached on the
left<00:01:57.509> side<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.869> harness<00:01:58.259> when<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
left side of your harness when the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.069 
left side of your harness when the
reserve<00:01:59.219> gets<00:01:59.520> extracted<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> you've<00:02:00.930> got

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
reserve gets extracted and you've got

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.450 
reserve gets extracted and you've got
the<00:02:01.140> possibility<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> main<00:02:02.040> reserve

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the possibility of main reserve

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.389 
the possibility of main reserve
entanglement<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.170> way<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> sort<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.219> as

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
entanglement so this way it sort of as

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.300 
entanglement so this way it sort of as
the<00:02:05.670> main<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.000> leaving<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.990> pulls<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.950> left

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the main is leaving it pulls that left

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.249 
the main is leaving it pulls that left
side<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> cutaway<00:02:09.060> cable<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
side of the cutaway cable out in a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
section of the the housing that is open

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.290 
section of the the housing that is open
right<00:02:13.660> behind<00:02:13.930> your<00:02:14.230> neck<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.550> if<00:02:16.150> you

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
right behind your neck so it's if you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.030 
right behind your neck so it's if you
pull<00:02:16.450> your<00:02:16.569> handle<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.319> way<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
pull your handle all the way out if you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.430 
pull your handle all the way out if you
don't<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:18.670> really<00:02:19.480> really<00:02:19.690> old<00:02:19.780> risers<00:02:20.260> that

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
don't have really really old risers that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.559 
don't have really really old risers that
might<00:02:20.620> break<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.220> sort<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.520> thing<00:02:21.580> it's

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
might break and that sort of thing it's

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.120 
might break and that sort of thing it's
not<00:02:22.720> absolutely<00:02:22.930> necessary<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.890> does

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
not absolutely necessary but it does

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.309 
not absolutely necessary but it does
make<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:25.030> manufacturer<00:02:25.690> feel<00:02:25.900> better<00:02:26.110> and

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
make the manufacturer feel better and

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.140 
make the manufacturer feel better and
quite<00:02:26.800> frankly<00:02:26.830> as<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.220> rigger<00:02:27.490> looking<00:02:27.940> at<00:02:28.060> it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
quite frankly as a rigger looking at it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.020 
quite frankly as a rigger looking at it
go<00:02:28.240> why<00:02:29.050> not<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.830> riser<00:02:30.130> breakage<00:02:30.670> would<00:02:30.850> be

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
go why not like riser breakage would be

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.970 
go why not like riser breakage would be
probably<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.720> main<00:02:31.959> one<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.200> could<00:02:32.770> cause

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
probably the main one that could cause

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.010 
probably the main one that could cause
that<00:02:33.010> issue<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:34.090> course<00:02:34.270> I<00:02:34.450> can't

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
that issue and of course I can't

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.330 
that issue and of course I can't
remember<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.320> last<00:02:35.380> time<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.830> saw<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.130> riser

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
remember the last time I saw a riser

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.460 
remember the last time I saw a riser
break<00:02:36.690> very<00:02:37.690> they're<00:02:37.870> they're<00:02:38.050> building<00:02:38.410> it

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
break very they're they're building it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.070 
break very they're they're building it
much<00:02:38.650> much<00:02:38.800> better<00:02:38.980> than<00:02:39.160> these<00:02:39.310> two<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.840> to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
much much better than these two so it to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.330 
much much better than these two so it to
me<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.350> much<00:02:41.500> more<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:41.770> somebody<00:02:42.070> pulls

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
me it's much more if somebody pulls

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.610 
me it's much more if somebody pulls
their<00:02:42.520> cutaway<00:02:43.000> handle<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.260> little<00:02:44.500> they

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
their cutaway handle just a little they

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320 
their cutaway handle just a little they
don't<00:02:44.800> get<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.010> all<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.220> way<00:02:45.580> out<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.760> happens

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
don't get it all the way out and happens

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.530 
don't get it all the way out and happens
to<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:47.020> some<00:02:47.260> reason<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.360> right

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
to be for some reason that the the right

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.710 
to be for some reason that the the right
side<00:02:49.750> extracts<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.010> left<00:02:51.190> side<00:02:51.340> doesn't

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
side extracts and the left side doesn't

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.900 
side extracts and the left side doesn't
which<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.980> don't<00:02:54.070> see<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.250> too<00:02:54.459> much<00:02:54.580> anyway

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
which you don't see that too much anyway

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.820 
which you don't see that too much anyway
I<00:02:54.940> mean<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.720> lots<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.110> adrenaline<00:02:56.650> when

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
I mean you have lots of adrenaline when

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.949 
I mean you have lots of adrenaline when
you've<00:02:57.730> got<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.940> malfunction<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> got<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> lots

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
you've got a malfunction you got a lots

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.810 
you've got a malfunction you got a lots
of<00:02:59.080> power<00:02:59.260> and<00:03:00.160> if<00:03:00.310> you've<00:03:00.489> actually

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
of power and if you've actually

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.570 
of power and if you've actually
physically<00:03:01.540> practice<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:02.050> cutaway

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
physically practice your cutaway

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.750 
physically practice your cutaway
procedure<00:03:03.580> on<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> regular<00:03:04.690> basis<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:06.459> tend<00:03:06.730> to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
procedure on a regular basis you tend to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.660 
procedure on a regular basis you tend to
execute<00:03:07.209> what<00:03:07.330> you've<00:03:07.450> practiced<00:03:08.400> okay<00:03:09.400> so

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
execute what you've practiced okay so

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.160 
execute what you've practiced okay so
you're<00:03:09.970> saying<00:03:10.239> how<00:03:10.420> often<00:03:10.750> should<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.050> be

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
you're saying how often should we be

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.259 
you're saying how often should we be
exercising<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:11.920> well<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.340> think<00:03:12.550> people

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
exercising that well I think people

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.270 
exercising that well I think people
should<00:03:13.300> be<00:03:13.510> doing<00:03:13.720> every<00:03:13.959> 30<00:03:14.170> or<00:03:14.230> 40<00:03:14.530> days<00:03:14.739> why

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
should be doing every 30 or 40 days why

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.710 
should be doing every 30 or 40 days why
not<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.760> mean<00:03:16.000> especially<00:03:16.090> if<00:03:16.450> you're<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.660> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
not I mean especially if you're in a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.270 
not I mean especially if you're in a
human<00:03:17.019> environment<00:03:17.560> where<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.950> riser

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
human environment where that riser

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.610 
human environment where that riser
material<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.030> going<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.329> get<00:03:19.480> rigid<00:03:20.079> at<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
material is going to get rigid at the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.319 
material is going to get rigid at the
very<00:03:20.829> least<00:03:21.010> even<00:03:21.310> without<00:03:21.489> cutting<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:22.060> away

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
very least even without cutting it away

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.990 
very least even without cutting it away
just<00:03:23.170> kind<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.410> push<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.769> riser<00:03:23.980> down<00:03:24.610> and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
just kind of push the riser down and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.319 
just kind of push the riser down and
create<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.900> space<00:03:25.989> at<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.650> bottom<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
create a little space at the bottom and
