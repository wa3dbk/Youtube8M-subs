00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:10.740
 Yes It is a corner of Tonken Institute limited teaching that began this corner is for everyone's question 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.040
 It is something that I will answer, but 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.330
 Hey fast, hey yeah Saitama 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.400
 Flow is a question from the miso ramen scattering 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.070
 Through 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:36.220
 Please talk about the relationship between talent and effort 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:40.570
 The difference between such a normal person Ichiroya west poly players can not be explained well 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.840
 It's easy to take the ideal for children 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:51.400
 I also wonder how they are 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:53.570
 There is also a need to say that a good word for rat 9 is also missing 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:00.230
 Well, in short 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.960
 This person is the one and I guess come children's in their its efforts Toka industry after this 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.420
 Convince me to say 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.780
 Well , once in a while on a TV something like four players or anna hot spring food is out 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 So for those people with, for example, it does say the wind 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 I wonder if there is any correlation 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.299
 It is such a thing to explain as a parent , and this is very important thing 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.990
 think 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:33.060
 All human beings can not be players or Honda once 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.760
 But when I explain it to that kid, what should I do? 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.680
 Ne I'm such that either 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.730
 Oh well this is the same thing for adults and even children 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.080
 Well I like to float on this typical 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.030
 As an example to answer 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.510
 North 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.510
 Sanyo is a container 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.710
 It is probably because of effort 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.610
 I I think the Fu that the easy-to-understand kana regarded as Ken Ken 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.070
 I want to be my sister 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.960
 Ummm 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.810
 Flows in front of yourself that say experience 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:21.490
 It's like river water 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 Where it is said to be like a baseball skin of I mean and did a baseball 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.330
 I sell water , for example , as a bowl 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.670
 I think this thing 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.140
 Do you understand 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 If you have trouble 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.599
 For example 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:45.790
 How many trains if it is a small bowl like that chocolate 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:51.550
 Know how the experience Tteyuu that what baseball 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.590
 Even if I drink water with chocolate, I think that the total amount is here 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:01.200
 Hey you 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:04.210
 If Ichiro and Honda are different, they are all probably withdrawn. 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.240
 It is felt like a month month lower moat 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:14.650
 Then there is a river of experience called baseball, and from that moment the players have it 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:19.930
 If you saved the zone and water with that huge vessel, there 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.530
 And because only those people do anything, the moon the right that water 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.480
 The amount is 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.740
 It will be a lot 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.550
 This is 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:38.050
 I think it's a difference, so I'm not saying it's going to be like this because I've experienced that many 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:42.880
 If it is different, it is the size of the vessel that the person holds 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.400
 If you think so and say that way , the arms of the last day's drowning water 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:53.520
 If you are able to understand that and say, different'm Dayo' 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.820
 Well Well Well as an example we also talk to this child 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.950
 I think the Fu Tteyuu Na or easy to understand the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:06.080
 But N loose stools in Chanko Mizukuma 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.760
 Even now, for example, the bucket is not full. 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.130
 Maybe 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.270
 It's a good thing 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.710
 I'm thinking of the garden 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.710
 I feel like
