Michael great sound got one of these

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.230 
Michael great sound got one of these
petals<00:01:59.780> somehow<00:02:00.670> allegedly<00:02:01.670> for

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240

world this is an original example from

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.509 
world this is an original example from
the<00:02:16.640> early<00:02:17.000> 70s<00:02:17.709> I've<00:02:18.709> had<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.099> in<00:02:19.190> my<00:02:19.370> own

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
the early 70s I've had it in my own

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.479 
the early 70s I've had it in my own
personal<00:02:20.319> Arsenal<00:02:21.319> for<00:02:21.560> years<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.099> years<00:02:22.370> and

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
personal Arsenal for years and years and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.199 
personal Arsenal for years and years and
it's<00:02:22.880> time<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:24.140> let<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.470> go<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.310> Octavia<00:02:25.760> is

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
it's time to to let it go the Octavia is

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.699 
it's time to to let it go the Octavia is
a<00:02:26.239> cool<00:02:26.599> effect<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:27.349> that<00:02:28.900> typically<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.290> works

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
a cool effect in that typically it works

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.580 
a cool effect in that typically it works
from<00:02:31.430> about<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.060> seventh<00:02:32.480> fret<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.989> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
from about the seventh fret up the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.259 
from about the seventh fret up the
higher<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.220> get<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.670> threat<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
higher you get on the threat of the

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.620 
higher you get on the threat of the
fretboard<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.100> more<00:02:37.450> harmonics<00:02:38.450> are

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
fretboard the more harmonics are

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.979 
fretboard the more harmonics are
incorporated<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.410> up<00:02:39.530> here<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:39.890> TV<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.870> you

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
incorporated so up here in TV when you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.240 
incorporated so up here in TV when you
get<00:02:48.200> two<00:02:48.560> notes<00:02:48.890> like<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.549> double<00:02:50.030> stop<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
get two notes like a double stop the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.580 
get two notes like a double stop the
harmonics<00:02:52.790> are<00:02:53.000> not<00:02:53.180> related<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.440> all

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
harmonics are not related so you get all

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.910 
harmonics are not related so you get all
kinds<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.950> crazy<00:02:55.150> extremely<00:02:56.260> insanity<00:02:59.920> but

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
kinds of crazy extremely insanity but

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.470 
kinds of crazy extremely insanity but
when<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.190> nip<00:03:01.400> notes<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.000> are<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> fourth

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
when you nip notes that are a fourth

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240 
when you nip notes that are a fourth
part<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.290> are<00:03:03.500> related

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
part and that are related

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.270 
part and that are related
you're<00:03:04.610> pretty<00:03:04.819> generated<00:03:05.510> telling

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.050 

Oh

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.000 

to<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.239> give<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.629> in<00:03:18.840> an<00:03:18.959> octagon<00:03:19.319> feature<00:03:19.890> to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to not give up in an octagon feature to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:32.160 
to not give up in an octagon feature to
look<00:03:20.189> at<00:03:20.370> weight<00:03:20.849> backing<00:03:21.659> off<00:03:21.870> your<00:03:22.140> volume

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:48.570 

ah<00:03:38.280> cleaner<00:03:39.280> octave<00:03:39.910> kind<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:47.340> putting<00:03:48.340> your

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
ah cleaner octave kind of putting your

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.630 
ah cleaner octave kind of putting your
tone<00:03:48.850> control<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.630> full<00:03:50.110> bass<00:03:50.470> also<00:03:50.980> gives<00:03:51.489> you

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
tone control on full bass also gives you

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:03.229 
tone control on full bass also gives you
another<00:03:51.970> texture<00:04:00.360> oh<00:04:01.500> no<00:04:02.500> it's<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.890> pretty

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
another texture oh no it's a pretty

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.360 
another texture oh no it's a pretty
versatile<00:04:04.239> effect<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:05.230> example<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.950> totally

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
