to tension the leather now when doing
this<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.350> need<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.770> be<00:01:23.890> really<00:01:24.340> really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
this you need to be really really

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.370 
this you need to be really really
careful<00:01:25.000> because<00:01:25.360> if<00:01:25.570> you're<00:01:25.720> not<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.170> you

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
careful because if you're not and you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.140 
careful because if you're not and you
over<00:01:26.590> tension<00:01:26.980> it<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.250> leather<00:01:27.430> can<00:01:27.640> tear<00:01:27.940> and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
over tension it the leather can tear and

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.840 
over tension it the leather can tear and
pull<00:01:28.300> off<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.420> rivets<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.470> if<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.460> does<00:01:30.670> start

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
pull off the rivets so if it does start

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.990 
pull off the rivets so if it does start
to<00:01:31.090> sag<00:01:31.420> after<00:01:31.870> excessive<00:01:32.590> usage<00:01:32.800> then<00:01:33.610> you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
to sag after excessive usage then you

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
to sag after excessive usage then you
just<00:01:34.210> tighten<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.140> fraction<00:01:35.860> at<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.010> time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
just tighten this a fraction at a time

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.320 
just tighten this a fraction at a time
to<00:01:37.390> take<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:37.660> any<00:01:38.050> slack<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.430> other<00:01:39.610> feature

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
these settles is worth it for the added

these settles is worth it for the added
comfort<00:02:27.319> most<00:02:28.319> people<00:02:28.709> say<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.310> takes

comfort most people say that it takes

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.540 
comfort most people say that it takes
somewhere<00:02:31.019> between<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.440> hundred<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
somewhere between a hundred and a

somewhere between a hundred and a
thousand<00:02:33.030> miles<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.420> break<00:02:33.690> them<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> I've

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
thousand miles to break them in I've

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.619 
thousand miles to break them in I've
only<00:02:35.040> done<00:02:35.190> forty<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.209> I've<00:02:36.269> got<00:02:36.450> to

only done forty on this and I've got to

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.080 
only done forty on this and I've got to
say<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.319> far<00:02:37.739> I've<00:02:38.430> got<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> say<00:02:38.910> it's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
say that's so far I've got to say it's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.930 
say that's so far I've got to say it's
not<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> comfortable<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.730> I'm

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
not really that comfortable but I'm

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.339 
not really that comfortable but I'm
going<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.120> stick<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.780> we'll<00:02:43.140> see

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
going to stick with it and we'll see

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.900 
going to stick with it and we'll see
where<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:44.010> over<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.280> next<00:02:44.489> month<00:02:44.760> or

it's meant to be

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.960 
it's meant to be
it<00:03:36.030> only<00:03:36.209> takes<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.780> tiny<00:03:37.530> amount<00:03:37.889> err<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.760> rub

first few months of opening and using

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.870 
first few months of opening and using
you<00:03:48.180> meant<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.540> do<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.260> every<00:03:50.160> every<00:03:50.370> so

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
you meant to do this every every so

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.690 
you meant to do this every every so
often<00:03:51.030> every<00:03:51.389> few<00:03:51.569> weeks<00:03:51.599> or<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.169> after<00:03:53.099> that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
often every few weeks or so after that

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.089 
often every few weeks or so after that
once<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.299> broken<00:03:54.599> in<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.349> probably<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.829> job

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
once it's broken in it's probably a job

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.699 
once it's broken in it's probably a job
to<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:56.400> once<00:03:56.940> every<00:03:57.090> six<00:03:57.450> months<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.680> other

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
to do once every six months the other

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.220 
to do once every six months the other
thing<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.250> helps<00:03:59.609> with<00:03:59.760> is

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
thing that this helps with is

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.650 
thing that this helps with is
waterproofing<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.950> saddle<00:04:02.280> itself<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:03.480> not

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
waterproofing the saddle itself is not

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.599 
waterproofing the saddle itself is not
waterproof<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.620> you've<00:04:04.799> got<00:04:04.919> to<00:04:05.010> be<00:04:05.069> fairly

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
waterproof so you've got to be fairly

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.140 
waterproof so you've got to be fairly
careful<00:04:05.910> about<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.889> this<00:04:07.889> adds<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.609> waterproof

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
careful about it this adds to waterproof

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150 
careful about it this adds to waterproof
now<00:04:09.389> Brooks<00:04:09.870> recommend<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.829> really

now Brooks recommend that you really

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.580 
now Brooks recommend that you really

only need to treat the top of the
