motion-activated dome light today and so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050 
motion-activated dome light today and so
that<00:00:25.320> little<00:00:25.529> demonstration<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.939> my

house this is right outside this little
step<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.489> goes<00:00:35.640> might<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.239> little

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
step here that goes might and a little

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
step here that goes might and a little
drive<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.800> goes<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.070> driveway<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.910> that's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
drive that goes my driveway and that's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
drive that goes my driveway and that's
our<00:00:39.629> outside<00:00:40.020> light<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.649> when<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:41.250> out<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
our outside light so when we go out to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
our outside light so when we go out to
dinner<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.820> keep<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.230> get

dinner we keep that on so when we get

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.060 
dinner we keep that on so when we get
back<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.250> everything<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:46.070> with

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
back we can see everything but with

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.660 
back we can see everything but with
hurricane<00:00:47.610> sandy<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.739> more<00:00:49.739> regularly<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
hurricane sandy and more regularly we

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.270 
hurricane sandy and more regularly we
have<00:00:50.850> pretty<00:00:51.750> bad<00:00:51.989> winter<00:00:52.379> storms<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.100> where

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
have pretty bad winter storms out where

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080 
have pretty bad winter storms out where
I<00:00:53.340> live<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.780> power<00:00:55.770> will<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.730> because

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I live and the power will go out because

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.930 
I live and the power will go out because
trees<00:00:57.539> fall<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.340> they<00:00:59.340> knock<00:00:59.520> down<00:00:59.699> power

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
trees fall and they knock down power

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
trees fall and they knock down power
lines<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:01.010> suddenly<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
lines and it's suddenly you don't have a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
lines and it's suddenly you don't have a
light<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
light like that or in here for that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.910 
light like that or in here for that
matter<00:01:04.680> um<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.810> when<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:07.350> no<00:01:07.530> light<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
matter um and when there's no light you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.820 
matter um and when there's no light you
can't<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.750> who's<00:01:10.710> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
can't see where you're going or who's on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
can't see where you're going or who's on
the<00:01:10.920> porch<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> let's<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.330> demo

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the porch so let's just do a little demo

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
the porch so let's just do a little demo
of<00:01:12.900> how<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.409> worse<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> without<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of how much worse it is without the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:39.910 
of how much worse it is without the
light

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.610 

so<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.090> probably<00:01:42.240> hear<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.900> was

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
so as you can probably hear I was

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.250 
so as you can probably hear I was
stomping<00:01:44.100> around<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.400> little<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.730> and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
stomping around a little out there and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.660 
stomping around a little out there and
actually<00:01:46.260> ran<00:01:46.500> into<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> door<00:01:46.890> cuz<00:01:47.370> I<00:01:47.490> had

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
actually ran into the door cuz I had

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
actually ran into the door cuz I had
absolutely<00:01:48.330> no<00:01:48.420> idea<00:01:48.570> where<00:01:48.990> anything<00:01:49.290> was

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
absolutely no idea where anything was

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280 
absolutely no idea where anything was
because<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:49.740> couldn't<00:01:50.010> see<00:01:50.160> anything<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.750> so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
because I couldn't see anything and so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.320 
because I couldn't see anything and so
not<00:01:52.710> only<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.400> like<00:01:53.580> unsafe<00:01:54.060> because

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
not only is that like unsafe because

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.810 
not only is that like unsafe because
there's<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.350> big<00:01:55.680> risk<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.280> tripping<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
there's a very big risk of tripping and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.360 
there's a very big risk of tripping and
falling<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.330> breaking<00:01:57.480> your<00:01:57.810> face<00:01:58.050> or<00:01:58.410> arm<00:01:58.860> or

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
falling and breaking your face or arm or

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.830 
falling and breaking your face or arm or
something<00:01:59.910> very<00:02:00.240> important<00:02:00.900> but<00:02:01.670> you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
something very important but you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.330 
something very important but you
couldn't<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:03.990> anybody<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.830> porch<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.280> if

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
couldn't see anybody on the porch and if

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.620 
couldn't see anybody on the porch and if
there's<00:02:05.520> somebody<00:02:05.730> on<00:02:05.970> your<00:02:06.000> porch<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.600> the

middle of the night and it's dark you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.330 
middle of the night and it's dark you
think<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.130> kinda<00:02:08.429> wanna<00:02:08.580> know<00:02:08.729> who<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
think you kinda wanna know who it is so

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.120 
think you kinda wanna know who it is so
this<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.760> where<00:02:12.090> mr.<00:02:12.690> beams<00:02:12.900> comes<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.920> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
this is where mr. beams comes in this is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.990 
this is where mr. beams comes in this is
their<00:02:15.709> 4c<00:02:16.709> battery-operated<00:02:20.000> motion

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
their 4c battery-operated motion

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.930 
their 4c battery-operated motion
activated<00:02:21.510> LED<00:02:21.840> light<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
activated LED light and so we have the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.199 
activated LED light and so we have the
LED<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.680> sticks<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.610> your<00:02:26.640> ceiling<00:02:27.120> you

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
LED here it sticks on your ceiling you

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.180 
LED here it sticks on your ceiling you
can<00:02:27.240> screw<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.870> or<00:02:28.170> use<00:02:28.380> double-sided<00:02:28.890> tape

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
can screw it in or use double-sided tape

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.340 
can screw it in or use double-sided tape
I<00:02:29.220> find<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> double-sided<00:02:30.270> tape<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.780> more

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
I find the double-sided tape is more

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.560 
I find the double-sided tape is more
than<00:02:31.530> adequate<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.370> doesn't<00:02:33.000> leave<00:02:33.090> messy

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
than adequate and doesn't leave messy

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.990 
than adequate and doesn't leave messy
holes<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.080> decide<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.440> move<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.860> or<00:02:35.070> take

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
holes if you decide to move it or take

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.970 
holes if you decide to move it or take
it<00:02:36.030> down<00:02:36.330> because<00:02:37.200> you're<00:02:37.440> moving<00:02:37.800> or

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
it down because you're moving or

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.100 
it down because you're moving or
whatever<00:02:38.990> these<00:02:39.990> are<00:02:40.790> neat<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.959> LED

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
whatever these are neat this is the LED

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.430 
whatever these are neat this is the LED
right<00:02:43.560> here<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.760> big<00:02:45.570> benefit<00:02:46.200> about

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
right here and the big benefit about

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280 
right here and the big benefit about
this<00:02:46.709> light<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.750> completely

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
this light is a it's completely

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.470 
this light is a it's completely
self-contained<00:02:49.590> has<00:02:50.489> its<00:02:50.700> own<00:02:50.850> power<00:02:51.120> source

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
self-contained has its own power source

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.150 
self-contained has its own power source
of<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.780> batteries<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.920> power

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
of the batteries and so on the power

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.830 
of the batteries and so on the power
goes<00:02:53.400> out<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.390> worry<00:02:54.570> about

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
goes out you don't have to worry about

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.550 
goes out you don't have to worry about
it<00:02:55.019> being<00:02:55.290> connected<00:02:55.800> into<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.010> grid<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:57.269> so

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
it being connected into the grid and so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
it being connected into the grid and so
you'll<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.769> light<00:02:59.340> even<00:02:59.760> though<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.000> might

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you'll have light even though you might

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.180 
you'll have light even though you might
not<00:03:00.209> have<00:03:00.510> power<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.320> second<00:03:01.680> big<00:03:01.800> thing<00:03:01.830> is

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
not have power the second big thing is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.770 
not have power the second big thing is
is<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.910> self-contained<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.630> don't

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
is because it's self-contained you don't

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.290 
is because it's self-contained you don't
need<00:03:03.900> an<00:03:03.989> electrician<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.860> cut<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> hole<00:03:06.120> in

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
need an electrician to cut a hole in

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.840 
need an electrician to cut a hole in

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to this product is that unlike other

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.620 
to this product is that unlike other
battery-powered<00:03:24.420> lights<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.170> uses<00:03:25.500> LEDs

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
battery-powered lights this uses LEDs

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.550 
battery-powered lights this uses LEDs
which<00:03:27.630> not<00:03:28.019> only<00:03:28.459> allow<00:03:29.720> for<00:03:30.720> great<00:03:31.230> battery

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
which not only allow for great battery

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.259 
which not only allow for great battery
life<00:03:31.769> because<00:03:32.130> they<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> very<00:03:32.760> very<00:03:32.850> low

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
life because they have a very very low

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.470 
life because they have a very very low
current<00:03:33.780> draw<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.440> also<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.760> never<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.360> to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
current draw it also you never have to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.850 
current draw it also you never have to
change<00:03:36.750> them<00:03:37.049> ever<00:03:37.200> because<00:03:37.560> they're<00:03:37.709> not

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
change them ever because they're not

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.009 
change them ever because they're not
like<00:03:38.160> incandescent<00:03:38.820> bulbs<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:39.540> it'll<00:03:39.780> stay

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
like incandescent bulbs so it'll stay

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.220 
like incandescent bulbs so it'll stay
fresh<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.130> ready<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.790> go<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.900> battery

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
fresh and ready to go and the battery

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.230 
fresh and ready to go and the battery
state<00:03:43.500> charge<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:44.040> think<00:03:44.070> most<00:03:44.790> people<00:03:45.090> get

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
state charge I think most people get

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.840 
state charge I think most people get
about<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.720> year<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.140> use<00:03:46.380> out<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.650> their<00:03:46.920> set<00:03:47.819> of

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
about a year of use out of their set of

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.820 
about a year of use out of their set of
batteries

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
batteries

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.330 
batteries
so<00:03:49.910> let's<00:03:50.910> go<00:03:51.360> outside<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.920> install<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
so let's go outside and install it and

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.390 
so let's go outside and install it and
I'll<00:03:53.760> show<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.000> how<00:03:54.180> easy<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.400> what

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
I'll show you how easy it is and what

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:05.090 
I'll show you how easy it is and what
kind<00:03:56.430> of<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:03.210> just<00:04:03.540> got<00:04:03.720> my<00:04:03.770> you<00:04:04.770> see<00:04:04.950> there's

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
kind of so I just got my you see there's

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.340 
kind of so I just got my you see there's
a<00:04:05.160> little<00:04:05.370> square<00:04:05.850> here<00:04:05.970> I've<00:04:06.660> only<00:04:06.840> got<00:04:07.110> two

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
a little square here I've only got two

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.770 
a little square here I've only got two
strips<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.860> double-sided<00:04:08.280> tape<00:04:08.520> I've<00:04:09.300> done

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
strips a double-sided tape I've done

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.320 
strips a double-sided tape I've done
three<00:04:10.260> before<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.670> had<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.910> use<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.060> putty

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
three before and I had to use a putty

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.410 
three before and I had to use a putty
scraper<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.440> get<00:04:13.530> her<00:04:13.620> off<00:04:13.740> the<00:04:13.890> ceiling<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.490> if

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
scraper to get her off the ceiling so if

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.120 
scraper to get her off the ceiling so if
you're<00:04:15.630> gonna<00:04:15.780> keep<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.380> for<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.560> long<00:04:16.770> term<00:04:16.980> I

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
you're gonna keep it for a long term I

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.190 
you're gonna keep it for a long term I
would<00:04:17.250> do<00:04:17.400> three<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.690> just<00:04:18.840> fill<00:04:19.050> in<00:04:19.170> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
would do three and you just fill in the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.610 
would do three and you just fill in the
square<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.830> then<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.310> right<00:04:21.150> here<00:04:21.380> just<00:04:22.380> pick

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
square and then so right here just pick

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.820 
square and then so right here just pick
a<00:04:22.770> spot<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:23.280> think<00:04:23.520> right<00:04:23.760> by<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.560> light<00:04:25.560> is

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
a spot I think right by the light is

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.620 
a spot I think right by the light is
probably<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.430> pretty<00:04:26.640> good<00:04:26.850> idea<00:04:26.970> because<00:04:27.360> it's

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
probably a pretty good idea because it's

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.200 
probably a pretty good idea because it's
meant<00:04:28.470> there<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> reason<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.430> let's<00:04:29.700> just

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
meant there for a reason so let's just

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.690 
meant there for a reason so let's just
take<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.250> back<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.580> can

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
take this this is the back that you can

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.720 
take this this is the back that you can
twist<00:04:33.300> off<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.870> light<00:04:34.410> off<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.640> we're

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
twist off the light off of and so we're

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.580 
twist off the light off of and so we're
just<00:04:35.790> going<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.030> take<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.540> there's<00:04:37.290> actually

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
just going to take that there's actually

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.100 
just going to take that there's actually
a<00:04:37.620> little<00:04:37.770> arrow<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.160> says<00:04:38.490> top<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.240> this

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
a little arrow that says top and this
