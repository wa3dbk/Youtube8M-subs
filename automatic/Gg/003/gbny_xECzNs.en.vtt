00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
who was on our team and I guess some

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970 
who was on our team and I guess some
other<00:00:32.489> people<00:00:32.790> went<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.120> them<00:00:33.860> ended<00:00:34.860> up

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

winning this game and I don't check out
the<00:00:40.469> scores<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.610> 25

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the scores I think it was a like 25

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.090 
the scores I think it was a like 25
points<00:00:42.750> or<00:00:42.840> something<00:00:43.170> when<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> host

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
points or something when the host

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
points or something when the host
migration<00:00:44.309> happened<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.960> from

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
migration happened so this is just from

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
migration happened so this is just from
the<00:00:46.260> host<00:00:46.379> migration<00:00:46.559> onward<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.510> look<00:00:48.510> at
