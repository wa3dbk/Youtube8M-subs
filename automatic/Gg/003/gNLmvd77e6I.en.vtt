00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
here and i never really understood I

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.749 
here and i never really understood I
guess<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.889> that<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.370> supposed<00:03:53.639> to<00:03:53.699> be

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:53.759 
guess it's just that you supposed to be

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.119 
guess it's just that you supposed to be
opening<00:03:53.909> his<00:03:54.269> mouth<00:03:54.509> or<00:03:54.840> something<00:03:55.129> just

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
opening his mouth or something just

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.770 
opening his mouth or something just
seems<00:03:56.280> weird<00:03:56.639> that's<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.180> kind<00:03:57.419> of<00:03:57.479> I<00:03:57.689> don't

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
seems weird that's just kind of I don't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.349 
seems weird that's just kind of I don't
know<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.290> guess<00:03:59.159> it's<00:03:59.549> hard<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.909> see<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.209> as

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
know I guess it's hard to see that as

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.300 
know I guess it's hard to see that as
like<00:04:00.479> a<00:04:00.540> mouth<00:04:00.870> when<00:04:01.169> his<00:04:01.259> eyes<00:04:01.500> are<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:02.129> if

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
like a mouth when his eyes are on it if

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.249 
like a mouth when his eyes are on it if
that's<00:04:02.459> what<00:04:02.639> that's<00:04:03.000> supposed<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.389> be<00:04:03.419> but

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
that's what that's supposed to be but

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.249 
that's what that's supposed to be but
anyway<00:04:05.150> closing<00:04:06.150> him<00:04:06.269> up<00:04:06.389> is<00:04:06.629> pretty<00:04:07.019> easy

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
anyway closing him up is pretty easy

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.999 
anyway closing him up is pretty easy
just<00:04:08.069> push<00:04:08.489> down<00:04:08.729> on<00:04:08.759> that<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.359> then<00:04:10.319> flip<00:04:10.799> up

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
guys and then it has all the traps at

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.670 
guys and then it has all the traps at
the<00:04:41.110> bottom<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.540> anyway<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:47.020> really

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
the bottom so anyway this is a really

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.470 
the bottom so anyway this is a really
simple<00:04:48.130> trap<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.730> mean<00:04:48.910> it's<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.090> um

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
simple trap I mean it's just um

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.730 
simple trap I mean it's just um
obviously<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.500> triangle<00:04:51.010> shape<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:52.590> we<00:04:53.590> have

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
obviously the triangle shape and we have

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.260 
obviously the triangle shape and we have
tripod<00:04:54.520> epsilon<00:04:54.970> ability<00:04:55.450> card<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:57.270> tripod

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
tripod epsilon ability card and tripod

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.400 
tripod epsilon ability card and tripod
epsilon<00:04:58.750> shoot<00:04:59.140> another<00:04:59.560> ability<00:04:59.860> card<00:05:00.280> and

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
epsilon shoot another ability card and

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.320 
epsilon shoot another ability card and
then<00:05:02.410> we<00:05:02.620> have<00:05:02.800> clear<00:05:03.430> river<00:05:03.730> which<00:05:04.030> is<00:05:04.180> the

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
then we have clear river which is the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.740 
then we have clear river which is the
gate<00:05:04.510> card<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:06.030> when<00:05:07.030> we<00:05:07.150> just<00:05:07.360> open<00:05:07.660> up

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
gate card and when we just open up

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.530 
gate card and when we just open up
tripod<00:05:08.200> epsilon<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:09.490> it's<00:05:09.910> really<00:05:10.060> all<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.450> is

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
tripod epsilon so it's really all it is

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.080 
tripod epsilon so it's really all it is
just<00:05:10.950> kind<00:05:11.950> of<00:05:11.980> opens<00:05:12.280> up<00:05:12.340> like<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.670> you<00:05:12.940> see

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
just kind of opens up like that you see

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.390 
just kind of opens up like that you see
the<00:05:13.180> little<00:05:13.360> frog<00:05:13.630> here<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.260> there's<00:05:15.220> like

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
the little frog here and there's like

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.210 
the little frog here and there's like
little<00:05:15.730> frog<00:05:16.630> faces<00:05:17.260> on<00:05:17.560> each<00:05:17.890> of<00:05:18.100> these

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
little frog faces on each of these

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.560 
little frog faces on each of these
little<00:05:18.490> things<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:19.170> then<00:05:20.170> we<00:05:20.350> have<00:05:20.500> darkest

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
little things and then we have darkest

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.670 
little things and then we have darkest
subterra<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.930> Pirus<00:05:23.560> for<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.070> different

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
subterra and Pirus for the different

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.400 
subterra and Pirus for the different
attributes<00:05:26.680> that<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.980> can<00:05:27.160> switch<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:28.410> so

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
attributes that it can switch to so

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.410 
attributes that it can switch to so
that's<00:05:29.860> pretty<00:05:30.130> much<00:05:30.250> all<00:05:30.490> there<00:05:30.670> is<00:05:30.730> a<00:05:31.120> just

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
that's pretty much all there is a just

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.910 
that's pretty much all there is a just
closing<00:05:31.870> them<00:05:31.960> up<00:05:32.080> as<00:05:32.230> really<00:05:32.440> simple<00:05:32.800> just

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
closing them up as really simple just

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.680 
closing them up as really simple just
fold<00:05:33.700> up<00:05:33.850> all<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.180> different<00:05:34.480> points<00:05:35.220> and

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
fold up all the different points and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.990 
fold up all the different points and
snap<00:05:37.690> them<00:05:37.840> together<00:05:38.160> last<00:05:39.160> but<00:05:39.370> not<00:05:39.400> least<00:05:39.520> is

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
snap them together last but not least is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.160 
snap them together last but not least is
the<00:05:40.060> Baku<00:05:40.600> tech<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:42.180> comes<00:05:43.180> with<00:05:43.420> another

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
the Baku tech and comes with another

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.610 
the Baku tech and comes with another
trap<00:05:44.590> squeeze<00:05:44.950> ability<00:05:45.790> card<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.470> then<00:05:47.470> the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
trap squeeze ability card and then the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.680 
trap squeeze ability card and then the
gate<00:05:47.800> card<00:05:48.450> called<00:05:49.450> reflection<00:05:50.260> gate<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:51.690> why

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
gate card called reflection gate and why

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.930 
gate card called reflection gate and why
don't<00:05:52.750> we<00:05:52.930> open<00:05:53.200> him<00:05:53.440> up<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.890> opening<00:05:54.700> them<00:05:54.790> up

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
don't we open him up and opening them up

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.890 
don't we open him up and opening them up
from<00:05:55.480> the<00:05:55.530> t<00:05:56.530> hablo<00:05:56.860> side<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:58.330> same<00:05:58.600> as<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
from the t hablo side the same as the

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.610 
from the t hablo side the same as the
other<00:05:59.020> one<00:05:59.230> he's<00:05:59.440> a<00:05:59.670> 460<00:06:00.670> g<00:06:01.320> but<00:06:02.320> it's<00:06:02.470> nice

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
other one he's a 460 g but it's nice

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.520 
other one he's a 460 g but it's nice
that<00:06:02.680> like<00:06:03.310> in<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.550> show<00:06:03.760> we<00:06:04.150> can<00:06:04.360> swap<00:06:05.290> them

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
that like in the show we can swap them

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.470 
that like in the show we can swap them
over<00:06:05.620> to<00:06:05.890> whichever<00:06:06.130> side<00:06:06.430> we<00:06:06.550> want<00:06:06.730> so<00:06:07.000> now<00:06:07.420> we

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
over to whichever side we want so now we

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.970 
over to whichever side we want so now we
have<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.840> angel<00:06:08.170> Assad<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:10.230> well<00:06:11.230> I<00:06:11.380> didn't

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
have the angel Assad and well I didn't

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.090 
have the angel Assad and well I didn't
uncover<00:06:12.160> his<00:06:12.580> g-power<00:06:12.940> he<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:13.540> 380<00:06:14.470> g<00:06:14.560> on<00:06:14.920> the

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
uncover his g-power he is 380 g on the

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.590 
uncover his g-power he is 380 g on the
side<00:06:15.310> I<00:06:15.340> forget<00:06:15.760> what<00:06:15.820> I<00:06:15.880> just<00:06:15.940> said<00:06:16.210> he<00:06:16.330> was<00:06:16.450> on

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
side I forget what I just said he was on

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.120 
side I forget what I just said he was on
the<00:06:16.630> other<00:06:16.720> side<00:06:16.840> he<00:06:17.940> 460<00:06:18.940> and<00:06:19.300> 380<00:06:19.810> so<00:06:20.770> I<00:06:20.800> guess

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
the other side he 460 and 380 so I guess

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.350 
the other side he 460 and 380 so I guess
the<00:06:21.820> Diablo<00:06:22.330> side<00:06:22.570> is<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:22.990> little<00:06:23.380> stronger<00:06:24.360> and

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
the Diablo side is a little stronger and

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.570 
the Diablo side is a little stronger and
we<00:06:25.690> have<00:06:25.870> it's<00:06:26.830> like<00:06:26.980> I<00:06:27.130> guess<00:06:27.310> those<00:06:27.550> are

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
we have it's like I guess those are

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.490 
we have it's like I guess those are
supposed<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.000> be<00:06:28.090> like<00:06:28.180> little<00:06:28.330> wings<00:06:28.660> in<00:06:29.380> the

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
supposed to be like little wings in the

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.310 
supposed to be like little wings in the
back<00:06:29.680> why<00:06:30.040> it's<00:06:30.220> white<00:06:30.490> but<00:06:31.300> it's<00:06:31.570> cool<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.840> i

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
back why it's white but it's cool that i

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.430 
back why it's white but it's cool that i
actually<00:06:32.710> have<00:06:33.190> Tim<00:06:34.090> like<00:06:34.300> this<00:06:34.540> now<00:06:34.750> I<00:06:35.050> I

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
actually have Tim like this now I I

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.440 
actually have Tim like this now I I
assume<00:06:35.980> that<00:06:36.010> they<00:06:36.280> release<00:06:36.670> this<00:06:37.150> in<00:06:37.360> the

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
assume that they release this in the

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.320 
assume that they release this in the
u.s.<00:06:37.750> I<00:06:37.990> don't<00:06:38.140> see<00:06:38.290> why<00:06:38.410> not<00:06:38.610> it's<00:06:39.610> just<00:06:39.850> I

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
u.s. I don't see why not it's just I

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.290 
u.s. I don't see why not it's just I
never<00:06:40.990> saw<00:06:41.680> one<00:06:41.919> before<00:06:41.980> because<00:06:42.820> like<00:06:43.150> I<00:06:43.240> said

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
never saw one before because like I said

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.570 
never saw one before because like I said
I<00:06:43.480> got<00:06:43.720> into

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
I got into

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.909 
I got into
bach<00:06:45.210> gone<00:06:45.509> pretty<00:06:45.990> much<00:06:46.169> at<00:06:46.319> the<00:06:46.409> end<00:06:46.560> of<00:06:46.740> new

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
bach gone pretty much at the end of new

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.270 
bach gone pretty much at the end of new
vestroia<00:06:47.810> toy<00:06:48.810> line<00:06:49.080> and<00:06:49.470> then<00:06:49.860> I<00:06:49.889> pretty<00:06:50.220> much

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
vestroia toy line and then I pretty much

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.040 
vestroia toy line and then I pretty much
started<00:06:50.729> buying<00:06:50.939> and<00:06:51.240> gunned<00:06:51.389> alien<00:06:51.750> invaders

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
started buying and gunned alien invaders

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.730 
started buying and gunned alien invaders
so<00:06:52.259> I<00:06:52.439> didn't<00:06:52.860> get<00:06:52.949> too<00:06:53.189> much<00:06:53.219> new<00:06:53.699> vestroia

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
so I didn't get too much new vestroia

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.520 
so I didn't get too much new vestroia
anyway<00:06:56.389> closing<00:06:57.389> up<00:06:57.479> this<00:06:57.689> side<00:06:57.900> again

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
anyway closing up this side again

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.409 
anyway closing up this side again
obviously<00:06:58.740> it<00:06:59.129> was<00:06:59.250> just<00:06:59.490> the<00:06:59.639> same<00:06:59.849> as<00:07:00.000> before

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
obviously it was just the same as before

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.839 
obviously it was just the same as before
but<00:07:00.659> this<00:07:01.169> side<00:07:01.469> just<00:07:01.860> kind<00:07:02.129> of<00:07:02.189> clothes<00:07:02.669> on

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:02.849 
but this side just kind of clothes on

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.480 
but this side just kind of clothes on
closing<00:07:03.629> on<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.840> sides<00:07:04.080> and<00:07:04.379> then<00:07:04.530> put<00:07:05.280> down

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
closing on the sides and then put down

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.390 
closing on the sides and then put down
the<00:07:05.639> top<00:07:06.650> I'm<00:07:07.650> not<00:07:07.770> sure<00:07:07.860> you<00:07:08.069> could<00:07:08.159> probably

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
the top I'm not sure you could probably

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.719 
the top I'm not sure you could probably
do<00:07:08.580> it<00:07:08.610> the<00:07:08.789> other<00:07:08.819> way<00:07:08.969> around<00:07:09.090> too<00:07:10.550> yeah<00:07:11.550> it's
