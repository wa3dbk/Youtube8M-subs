00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.990
 With the Balkan Disk Manager you get a comprehensive set 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.909
 powerful way draws 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.909
 with which you solve the vast majority of problems alone 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.509
 who deal with their first four encounters 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.279
 this important feature for all aspects of their lifecycle 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.249
 calculator 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.460
 miss them in their hard drive below 30 degrees in the sun 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 Backup recovery and it's him the faction 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 until the safe recovery of a discarded hard drive 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.850
 For example, he can help them install a hard drive 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 to prepare a new operating system 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.470
 if they just need to install a new operating system 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.890
 want and already a corresponding tradition for this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.750
 Task accomplished 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 Of course you can determine the necessary settings yourself 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.320
 the race for the last scenes of the club 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.620
 the installation of the operating system since the fact in a real alternative 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.200
 Ettenheim BZ 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.860
 With the Fund Manager you make the selection of the operating system easier 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.960
 go up 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.540
 To do this, they run the hard drive with their horse system 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.630
 it is no coincidence that an automatic act 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 when the rest has done hold on to it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 Of course, the tare of Hard Disk Manager can be modified to especially Talos 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.040
 All you have to do is select which hard disks the new one will use 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.319
 Position should be and their size of care not possible the former 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.609
 In addition, of course, more can and can be more limited 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.040
 also for data loss protects the Paragon Disk Manager is one 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 User-friendly backup and restore functions 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.600
 so it is at least left Madrid and is sure to a lot 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.810
 Hard disk or only from certain time limits 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.289
 These can also be an optical disks internal or external 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.639
 hard drives 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.869
 or save a ftp server 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.109
 The fuses can also be set regularly 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.109
 and the better than I can guarantee at any time 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.699
 Additionally, on Tuesday they have manager it is a defensive weapon 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.759
 another districts 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.629
 No matter if you have a complete system hard drive in another computer 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.309
 install under the contents of the hard disk 64 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.319
 Disk Manager allows e-mail the already installed operating system 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.859
 by the integration of drivers Hans deviating hardware adapt 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.099
 So their operating system also starts to try on the new computer 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.299
 For consistency only performance, disks should be defragmented on a regular basis 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:54.800
 become 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.610
 and over time, the list includes accounts the TG 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 that too is a job for Paragon Disk Manager 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.849
 complete drives or individual partitions in it are analyzed 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.209
 agreed to the degree of fragmentation 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.399
 October is easily comprehensible graphed 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.159
 just as positively voted the portal 2 1 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 The hard drive has started its journey sometime 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.059
 however, before they are sold or disposed of 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.389
 no longer worry about their private data 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.419
 and of it 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.499
 what proved with modern software on busy species 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.559
 That's why Disk Administrator offers an assistant the garden of her 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.529
 Not only leaves hard drive or individual partitions 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.009
 Sanan sure 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.099
 now their hard drive has been time pressure did not indicate positive data 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.529
 one day a bit pulled reconstructed 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:57.369
 You can now again fascinatingly install an operating system or how 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.230
 it continues from 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.939
 Therefore, Marc Pfertzel forgave 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.089
 with whom one has determined
