going to talk a little bit about
distance<00:00:15.500> control<00:00:15.799> puttting<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:16.610> a<00:00:16.640> lot<00:00:16.910> of

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
distance control puttting so a lot of

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.970 
distance control puttting so a lot of
people<00:00:17.030> call<00:00:17.270> it<00:00:17.300> lag<00:00:17.570> cutting<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.230> this<00:00:18.800> is

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
people call it lag cutting and this is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.080 
people call it lag cutting and this is
where<00:00:19.190> we're<00:00:19.400> trying<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:19.670> get<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:19.880> ball<00:00:20.029> up

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
where we're trying to get the ball up

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.500 
where we're trying to get the ball up
close<00:00:20.720> enough<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:21.860> that<00:00:21.890> we<00:00:22.640> can<00:00:22.850> just<00:00:23.000> tap<00:00:23.330> it

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
close enough so that we can just tap it

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.420 
close enough so that we can just tap it
in<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:23.840> we<00:00:23.930> don't<00:00:24.080> have<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.350> four<00:00:24.800> five<00:00:25.070> six

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.520 
in so we don't have a four five six
footer<00:00:25.790> but<00:00:26.450> have<00:00:26.630> more<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:27.020> one<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.500> three

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
footer or you know if it goes in hey

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.010 
footer or you know if it goes in hey
that's<00:00:30.860> that's<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.310> bonus<00:00:31.960> percentages<00:00:32.960> show

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
that's that's a bonus percentages show

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.049 
that's that's a bonus percentages show
us<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.559> there's<00:00:33.739> not<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:33.920> lot<00:00:34.219> of<00:00:34.430> these<00:00:34.520> go<00:00:34.850> in

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
us that there's not a lot of these go in

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.660 
us that there's not a lot of these go in
so<00:00:35.780> our<00:00:36.110> goal<00:00:36.379> would<00:00:36.620> be<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.860> make<00:00:37.100> sure<00:00:37.249> that

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
so our goal would be to make sure that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.389 
so our goal would be to make sure that
we<00:00:37.730> get<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:37.909> close<00:00:38.260> now<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.589> lot<00:00:39.949> of<00:00:39.980> us<00:00:40.190> have

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
we get it close now a lot of us have

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.119 
we get it close now a lot of us have
developed<00:00:40.909> our<00:00:40.999> feel<00:00:41.359> in<00:00:41.690> putting<00:00:42.260> maybe<00:00:42.949> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
developed our feel in putting maybe the

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.389 
developed our feel in putting maybe the
wrong<00:00:43.249> way<00:00:43.579> we<00:00:44.269> we<00:00:44.539> got<00:00:44.690> real<00:00:44.929> mechanical<00:00:45.559> we

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
wrong way we we got real mechanical we

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.110 
wrong way we we got real mechanical we
tried<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.239> be<00:00:47.480> too<00:00:48.260> perfect<00:00:48.589> too<00:00:49.579> much<00:00:49.850> too

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
tried to be too perfect too much too

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.139 
tried to be too perfect too much too
early<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.800> we<00:00:51.800> didn't<00:00:52.129> really<00:00:52.339> unlock<00:00:52.819> our

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
early and we didn't really unlock our

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.829 
early and we didn't really unlock our
feel<00:00:53.479> sensors<00:00:54.109> that<00:00:55.269> we<00:00:56.269> would<00:00:56.420> have<00:00:56.600> if<00:00:56.719> we

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
feel sensors that we would have if we

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.750 
feel sensors that we would have if we
were<00:00:56.929> tossing<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.469> ball<00:00:57.499> so<00:00:58.249> we<00:00:58.370> had<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> ball

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
were tossing a ball so we had a ball

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910 
were tossing a ball so we had a ball
we're<00:00:58.999> going<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.179> toss<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.719> then<00:01:00.499> if<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:00.739> threw

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
we're going to toss it then if we threw

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.619 
we're going to toss it then if we threw
it<00:01:01.039> too<00:01:01.190> far<00:01:01.460> we<00:01:01.670> throw<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:01.969> easier<00:01:02.269> next<00:01:02.449> time

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
it too far we throw it easier next time

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.849 
it too far we throw it easier next time
and<00:01:03.109> vice<00:01:03.229> versa

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
and vice versa

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.399 
and vice versa
until<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.430> kind<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.820> found<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.299> field<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.900> so

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
until we kind of found the field and so

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.750 
until we kind of found the field and so
that's<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.830> drill<00:01:07.070> I'm<00:01:07.190> going<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.430> have<00:01:07.580> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.940 
first one a lot of people think of first
very<00:01:14.630> unorthodox<00:01:14.990> instead<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.680> having<00:01:15.860> you

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
very unorthodox instead of having you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.110 
very unorthodox instead of having you
look<00:01:16.100> at<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.280> ball<00:01:16.460> I'm<00:01:16.610> going<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.820> have<00:01:16.940> you

get everything set up and then instead

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.600 
get everything set up and then instead
of<00:01:54.560> looking<00:01:54.800> at<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.980> ball<00:01:55.160> I'm<00:01:55.280> going<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.490> look

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
of looking at the ball I'm going to look

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.210 
of looking at the ball I'm going to look
at<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.790> hole<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.330> then<00:01:56.840> put<00:01:56.870> and<00:01:57.530> I'm<00:01:58.040> going

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
at the hole and then put and I'm going

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.690 
at the hole and then put and I'm going
to<00:01:58.250> observe<00:01:58.580> what<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.000> putt<00:01:59.210> does<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:01.670> I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
to observe what the putt does and so I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.860 
to observe what the putt does and so I
see<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.090> went<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.300> little<00:02:02.480> bit<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.840> right

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
see it went a little bit to the right

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.600 
see it went a little bit to the right
and<00:02:03.050> came<00:02:03.500> up<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.770> little<00:02:03.950> bit<00:02:04.100> short

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
and came up a little bit short

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.120 
and came up a little bit short
so<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:05.390> I'm<00:02:05.510> going<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.530> same<00:02:06.740> thing

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
so now I'm going to do the same thing

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.770 
so now I'm going to do the same thing
but<00:02:07.640> I'm<00:02:07.760> going<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:07.970> adjust<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.390> get<00:02:11.690> it

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
but I'm going to adjust and so get it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.900 
but I'm going to adjust and so get it
started<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.170> little<00:02:12.349> more<00:02:12.470> left<00:02:12.760> hit<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.880> a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
started a little more left hit it a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.970 
started a little more left hit it a
little<00:02:14.090> bit<00:02:14.180> harder<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:16.010> then<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.850> goes

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
little bit harder and then it goes

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860 
little bit harder and then it goes
and<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.459> happens<00:02:19.090> I'm<00:02:19.180> telling<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.690> that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
happens all the time

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.490 
happens all the time
Evans<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.720> time<00:02:22.900> never<00:02:23.170> seen<00:02:23.349> anything

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
Evans all the time never seen anything

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.440 
Evans all the time never seen anything
like<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.099> uncanny<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.849> give<00:02:25.060> people<00:02:25.269> this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
like it just uncanny I give people this

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.930 
like it just uncanny I give people this
drill<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.050> we<00:02:26.980> could<00:02:27.099> stand<00:02:27.280> there<00:02:27.400> all<00:02:27.610> day

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
drill and we could stand there all day

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.160 
drill and we could stand there all day
and<00:02:28.300> if<00:02:28.450> they're<00:02:28.569> looking<00:02:28.720> at<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.019> ball

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
and if they're looking at the ball

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.020 
and if they're looking at the ball
they'd<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> hard<00:02:29.739> time<00:02:30.099> making<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.519> we<00:02:30.970> do

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
they'd have a hard time making it we do

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.940 
they'd have a hard time making it we do
this<00:02:31.300> drill<00:02:31.540> within<00:02:31.900> 10<00:02:32.140> putts<00:02:32.410> one<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.800> them

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
this drill within 10 putts one of them

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.110 
this drill within 10 putts one of them
goes<00:02:33.099> in<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.940> uncanny<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:36.120> adjusting

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
goes in it's uncanny so adjusting

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.210 
goes in it's uncanny so adjusting
athletically<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.050> way<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> do<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
athletically is the way to do it the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.210 
athletically is the way to do it the
second<00:02:39.670> drill<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.590> we're<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> putt<00:02:42.010> with

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
second drill is we're going to putt with

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820 
second drill is we're going to putt with
one<00:02:42.430> hand<00:02:42.730> only<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.349> found<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
one hand only so what I have found you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.009 
one hand only so what I have found you
know<00:02:44.920> what<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.099> used<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:46.000> at<00:02:46.209> first<00:02:46.420> I'd

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
know what I used to do this at first I'd

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.720 
know what I used to do this at first I'd
always<00:02:47.349> see<00:02:47.530> people<00:02:47.860> put<00:02:48.069> really<00:02:48.340> well<00:02:48.489> that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
always see people put really well that

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.120 
always see people put really well that
way<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.569> liked<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.930> way<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.080> sounded<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:51.040> I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
way and I liked the way it sounded and I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.589 
way and I liked the way it sounded and I
guess<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.519> while<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.730> wasn't<00:02:52.000> sure<00:02:52.299> why<00:02:52.540> it

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
guess for a while I wasn't sure why it

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.320 
guess for a while I wasn't sure why it
worked<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:54.340> thinking<00:02:54.730> about<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.060> more<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
worked but in thinking about it more and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.080 
worked but in thinking about it more and
more<00:02:55.510> with<00:02:56.170> one<00:02:56.440> hand<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:57.310> end<00:02:57.519> up<00:02:57.730> more

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
more with one hand you end up more

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.970 
more with one hand you end up more
pendulum<00:02:58.720> style<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.230> ends<00:02:59.470> up<00:02:59.530> being<00:02:59.709> more<00:02:59.920> of

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
pendulum style it ends up being more of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.210 
pendulum style it ends up being more of
a<00:03:00.099> swing<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:01.349> guided<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:02.530> rigid<00:03:03.099> and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
a swing and not guided and rigid and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.850 
a swing and not guided and rigid and
trying<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.060> be<00:03:04.209> too<00:03:04.450> perfect<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.110> too<00:03:05.230> careful

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
trying to be too perfect and too careful

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.180 
trying to be too perfect and too careful
so<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.910> hand<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:08.620> here<00:03:08.950> we'll<00:03:09.069> be

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
so with one hand and then here we'll be

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.089 
so with one hand and then here we'll be
looking<00:03:09.489> at<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.670> ball<00:03:09.819> not<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> hole<00:03:13.860> we<00:03:14.860> just

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
looking at the ball not the hole we just

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.910 
looking at the ball not the hole we just
get<00:03:15.250> really<00:03:15.579> good<00:03:15.940> rolls<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.690> ball<00:03:16.920> we

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
get really good rolls of the ball we

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.900 
get really good rolls of the ball we
really<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:18.660> rolled<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> ball<00:03:20.079> well<00:03:20.910> same

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
really just rolled the ball well same

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.800 
really just rolled the ball well same
thing<00:03:21.940> we<00:03:22.329> kind<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.630> adjust<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.170> what<00:03:23.319> we<00:03:23.440> see

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.360 

so<00:03:28.810> putting<00:03:29.109> with<00:03:29.260> one<00:03:29.470> hand<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:30.040> find

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
so putting with one hand I find

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.039 
so putting with one hand I find
sometimes<00:03:30.970> I'm<00:03:31.269> better<00:03:31.450> with<00:03:31.630> one<00:03:31.780> hand<00:03:31.810> than

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
sometimes I'm better with one hand than

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.259 
sometimes I'm better with one hand than
I<00:03:32.200> am<00:03:32.319> with<00:03:32.500> two<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.069> I'll<00:03:33.430> put<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.910> way<00:03:34.060> from

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
I am with two so I'll put that way from

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.870 
I am with two so I'll put that way from
time<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.660> time<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.170> then<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.310> third<00:03:36.549> drill

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
time to time and then the third drill

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.759 
time to time and then the third drill
that<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.359> kind<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.780> ties<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.290> whole<00:03:38.350> thing

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that that kind of ties this whole thing

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.250 
that that kind of ties this whole thing
together<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.970> my<00:03:40.150> vision<00:03:40.720> has<00:03:40.840> helped<00:03:41.170> me

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
together is that my vision has helped me

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.800 
together is that my vision has helped me
get<00:03:41.410> feel<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> first<00:03:42.280> drill<00:03:42.579> my<00:03:43.269> sense<00:03:43.600> of

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
get feel on the first drill my sense of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.140 
get feel on the first drill my sense of
touch<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.459> pendulum<00:03:45.459> has<00:03:45.579> helped<00:03:45.819> me<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:46.000> that

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
touch and pendulum has helped me on that

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.599 
touch and pendulum has helped me on that
second<00:03:46.569> drill<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.989> then<00:03:47.410> this<00:03:47.650> one<00:03:47.980> it's

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
second drill and then this one it's

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.340 
second drill and then this one it's
really<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.150> dial<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.780> see<00:03:49.959> how<00:03:50.170> much

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
really going to dial in and see how much

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.150 
really going to dial in and see how much
of<00:03:50.530> my<00:03:50.680> experiences<00:03:51.549> can<00:03:52.480> have<00:03:53.049> have<00:03:53.769> have

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
of my experiences can have have have

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.220 
of my experiences can have have have
come<00:03:54.430> into<00:03:54.639> my<00:03:54.760> system<00:03:55.299> so<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.480> can<00:03:55.690> feel<00:03:55.930> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
come into my system so I can feel it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.349 
come into my system so I can feel it
so<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:56.829> one<00:03:57.010> we're<00:03:57.370> going<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.549> stand<00:03:57.940> here

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
so this one we're going to stand here

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.349 
so this one we're going to stand here
we're<00:03:58.870> going<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.049> look<00:03:59.290> we're<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.680> putt

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
we're going to look we're going to putt

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.430 
we're going to look we're going to putt
we're<00:04:01.359> going<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.540> keep<00:04:01.750> looking<00:04:01.930> here<00:04:02.290> and

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
we're going to keep looking here and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.620 
we're going to keep looking here and
before<00:04:02.889> we<00:04:03.730> look<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.090> see<00:04:04.269> where<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.480> ball

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
before we look to see where the ball

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.479 
before we look to see where the ball
ends<00:04:04.810> up<00:04:04.959> we've<00:04:05.139> got<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.380> make<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> guess<00:04:05.859> so

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
ends up we've got to make a guess so

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.490 
ends up we've got to make a guess so
this<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.970> don't<00:04:07.209> look<00:04:07.420> drill<00:04:07.780> don't<00:04:08.319> look

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
this is the don't look drill don't look

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.430 
this is the don't look drill don't look
and<00:04:08.680> guess<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:10.569> I<00:04:10.599> know<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:10.930> brakes<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.319> little

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
and guess so I know this brakes a little

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.319 
and guess so I know this brakes a little
bit<00:04:11.590> left<00:04:11.889> to<00:04:11.980> right<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.489> think<00:04:15.579> that's<00:04:15.940> left

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
bit left to right so I think that's left

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.960 
bit left to right so I think that's left
and<00:04:16.539> long

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.010 

so<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.030> was<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.180> little<00:04:20.300> bit<00:04:20.450> left<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.810> little<00:04:20.900> bit

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
so it was a little bit left a little bit

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.140 
so it was a little bit left a little bit
long<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.530> was<00:04:21.740> a<00:04:21.770> good<00:04:21.980> call<00:04:22.220> let<00:04:22.940> me<00:04:23.000> do

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
long so that was a good call let me do

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.680 
long so that was a good call let me do
another<00:04:23.180> one<00:04:23.540> I<00:04:27.880> think<00:04:28.880> that's<00:04:29.180> pretty<00:04:29.360> close

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
another one I think that's pretty close

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.930 
another one I think that's pretty close
so<00:04:32.230> that's<00:04:33.230> within<00:04:33.410> six<00:04:33.800> inches<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.790> me

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
so that's within six inches so it to me

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.910 
so that's within six inches so it to me
anything<00:04:35.210> within<00:04:35.540> six<00:04:35.780> inches<00:04:35.930> when<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.740> say

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
anything within six inches when you say

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.110 
anything within six inches when you say
it's<00:04:37.040> going<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.310> close<00:04:37.610> that's<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.970> good

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
it's going to be close that's a good

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.200 
it's going to be close that's a good
call<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:39.590> if<00:04:39.740> you're<00:04:39.980> making<00:04:40.310> good<00:04:40.490> calls<00:04:40.790> then

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
call so if you're making good calls then

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.540 
call so if you're making good calls then
your<00:04:41.360> sense<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.780> touch<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.170> feel<00:04:42.440> are<00:04:42.860> where

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
your sense of touch and feel are where

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.220 
your sense of touch and feel are where
they<00:04:43.700> need<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:43.910> be<00:04:44.000> if<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.660> put<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.140> go<00:04:45.200> I

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
they need to be if you put it and go I

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.380 
they need to be if you put it and go I
have<00:04:45.500> no<00:04:45.650> idea<00:04:46.040> that's<00:04:46.670> where<00:04:46.970> these<00:04:47.120> other

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
have no idea that's where these other

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.600 
have no idea that's where these other
drills<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.170> one<00:04:48.320> come<00:04:48.560> in<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.250> develop

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
drills and that one come in to develop

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.340 
drills and that one come in to develop
your<00:04:49.760> field<00:04:50.000> these<00:04:50.510> three<00:04:50.840> drills<00:04:51.080> put

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
your field these three drills put

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.950 
your field these three drills put
together<00:04:51.680> develop<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.670> very<00:04:52.850> athletic<00:04:53.090> sense

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
together develop a very athletic sense

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.940 
together develop a very athletic sense
of<00:04:54.640> how<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:55.700> putt<00:04:56.060> from<00:04:56.330> distances<00:04:57.230> and<00:04:57.470> you

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
of how to putt from distances and you

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.210 
of how to putt from distances and you
will<00:04:58.070> become<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.400> better<00:04:58.580> lag<00:04:58.880> putter
