medium<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:15.710> i<00:00:16.710> think<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.039> could<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
medium and i think it could be a little

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.029 
medium and i think it could be a little
bit<00:00:17.940> darker<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.390> i<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.869> far<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
bit darker but i like it so far all you

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.800 
bit darker but i like it so far all you
do<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.580> pull<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.630> there's

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
do is just pull this just so there's

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.790 
do is just pull this just so there's
like<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.320> bitty<00:00:24.109> just<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
like a little bitty just a little bit of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
like a little bitty just a little bit of
distance<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> opens<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:28.019> there

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
distance kind of it opens it right there

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.139 
distance kind of it opens it right there
pull<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.510> squeeze

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
pull that and then you just squeeze

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.770 
pull that and then you just squeeze
until<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.450> comes<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:35.329> gently<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
until it comes out gently because it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.600 
until it comes out gently because it
comes<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.050> real<00:00:37.290> real<00:00:37.559> thick<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
comes out real real thick like that and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:49.930 
comes out real real thick like that and
then

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.910 

and<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.600> just<00:00:50.780> apply<00:00:51.050> this<00:00:51.109> right<00:00:51.379> on<00:00:51.500> top<00:00:51.649> of<00:00:51.680> my

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
and I just apply this right on top of my

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:20.860 
and I just apply this right on top of my
foundation

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.690 

and<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.440> really<00:01:21.740> don't<00:01:21.890> know<00:01:21.980> if<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:22.370> see

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and I really don't know if you can see

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.670 
and I really don't know if you can see
in<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.000> camera<00:01:23.420> but<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.720> gives<00:01:23.870> it<00:01:24.050> real<00:01:24.350> like

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
in the camera but it gives it real like

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.210 
in the camera but it gives it real like
a<00:01:24.710> dewy<00:01:25.100> look<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:29.110> as<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.290> dries<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:30.530> still<00:01:30.950> has

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
a dewy look and as it dries it still has

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.350 
a dewy look and as it dries it still has
that<00:01:31.430> look<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:33.280> put<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.580> tiny<00:01:34.850> bit<00:01:34.970> more

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
that look to it put just a tiny bit more

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
that look to it put just a tiny bit more
on

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.510 

and<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.840> light<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.680> medium<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and this is the light to medium so I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.420 
and this is the light to medium so I
could<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.820> probably<00:01:54.000> stood<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:56.100> too

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
could have probably stood to go you too

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.360 
could have probably stood to go you too
dark

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.380 

I<00:02:01.430> just<00:02:02.180> put<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.570> like<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:04.390> kind

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
I just put it on like that and then kind

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:29.510 
I just put it on like that and then kind
of<00:02:05.540> blend<00:02:05.900> it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.640 

and<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.450> forget<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.780> close<00:02:30.930> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.920 

but<00:02:37.579> that<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.909> it<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.209> how<00:02:38.450> i<00:02:38.480> use<00:02:40.930> the
