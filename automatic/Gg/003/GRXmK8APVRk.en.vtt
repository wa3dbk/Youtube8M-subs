00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.880
 it's already disco 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.400
 on the last dvd you recorded of course 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 can and does in some countries 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 root country music is not what is the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.490
 public focus on my site with 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.090
 and also recorded six 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 tracks will look like these is on the dvd's voice and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 viola which incidentally was excellent congratulations 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 What can we expect from viola? 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.990
 Caipira in this bbb that is going to be recorded 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.110
 tomorrow there are plenty of people like 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.250
 came the first disc came at the beginning of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 our career has always been a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 concern to keep them in this 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.480
 a little quieter always 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 carrying this flag day and viola 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.450
 more in this DVD comes with the one already coming 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.190
 we must trust the openness and the environment and 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.640
 gave a little more ahead we will 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.750
 have some recordings never recordings 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.790
 will be in style and more roots than 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.949
 woman is not reminding a postman 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.020
 and making a toada will have the pagodas 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.820
 of viola can not miss 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.250
 Surely the viola will be 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.090
 this gift not only launches dvd 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.090
 forever 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.450
 the gardens the last two babies you 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.479
 recorded in places closed was a 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.909
 smaller audience is tomorrow 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.610
 It is certainly a crowded time 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.000
 in theory it's okay it will not be any more 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.770
 cold any expectation of dealing 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.080
 with this audience - while recording 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.630
 because it's something different imagine 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.780
 today is the first first since our 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.020
 wine index because of the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.119
 people were burning that same thing 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.149
 said where the plant is made 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.789
 although it is small 5 is with the public 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.159
 greatly reduced but that proposal was 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.039
 we had the duty is precisely the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.899
 great day that has already become 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.759
 decelerates without false modesty shows that 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.929
 We've been doing the island lately. 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.799
 of 10 thousand ten thousand people in 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.299
 average 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.530
 so we have to show what 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.060
 a show happens and for how great was the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.489
 of expogrande recordings 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.780
 So we 're doing what the 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.250
 our reality 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.860
 until then I think he 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.600
 the world should have our complex are 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.770
 great at this time we are 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.230
 showing your crew 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.640
 the structure once again that is already 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 maintaining as I said this moment that the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.500
 I do sing registering 10 whore 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.070
 people have had in brazil that in the field 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.830
 great 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.130
 would be the fourth place to choose who 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.590
 You know the affection I get here in the field. 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.170
 big our time this is the same in 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.890
 excess loads were not voted 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.910
 so we never touch it 's open square is 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.540
 so open option but I expect a lot 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.540
 same people 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.730
 here is a strong door always there with 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.730
 assurance
