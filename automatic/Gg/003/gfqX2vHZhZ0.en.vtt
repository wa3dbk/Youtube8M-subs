00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the scar and i'll probably remain that

the scar and i'll probably remain that
way<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.559> long<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.399> might<00:00:38.820> remain<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
way for a long time it might remain that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860 
way for a long time it might remain that
way<00:00:39.450> always<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.550> lot<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> people<00:00:41.879> may<00:00:42.030> say<00:00:42.329> the

way always a lot of people may say the

assault<00:00:46.649> rifles<00:00:47.100> personally<00:00:47.850> though<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.210> don't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
assault rifles personally though I don't

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
assault rifles personally though I don't
like<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> type<00:00:48.930> 95<00:00:49.230> much<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.520> anymore<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
like the type 95 much at all anymore I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
like the type 95 much at all anymore I
find<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.390> worth<00:00:54.660> using<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
find it to be it's not worth using it's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
find it to be it's not worth using it's
really<00:00:56.010> never<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.969> burst<00:00:57.239> kill<00:00:57.539> anymore

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
really never a one burst kill anymore

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
really never a one burst kill anymore
and<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.739> burst<00:00:59.010> weapon<00:00:59.489> doesn't<00:00:59.850> kill<00:01:00.180> in

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and if a burst weapon doesn't kill in

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
and if a burst weapon doesn't kill in
one<00:01:00.570> burst<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.230> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> pointless<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.399> be

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
one burst it's kind of pointless to be

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.770 
one burst it's kind of pointless to be
using<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.090> you'd<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.359> much<00:01:03.480> better<00:01:03.539> off

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
using it and you'd be much better off

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
using it and you'd be much better off
using<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.229> fully<00:01:04.559> automatic<00:01:05.100> assault<00:01:05.519> rifle

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
using a fully automatic assault rifle

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.899 
using a fully automatic assault rifle
but<00:01:06.479> that's<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:06.960> take<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.790> think<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
but that's just my take on it I think in

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.719 
but that's just my take on it I think in
phinney<00:01:09.090> war<00:01:09.299> patch<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> type<00:01:10.080> 95<00:01:10.490> too<00:01:11.490> much

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
phinney war patch the type 95 too much

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.070 
phinney war patch the type 95 too much
and<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.560> happens<00:01:14.960> moving<00:01:15.960> on

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and that's just what happens moving on

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
and that's just what happens moving on
though<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> scar<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:18.030> than<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
though I do like the scar more than the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
though I do like the scar more than the
ACR<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> that's<00:01:18.900> probably<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> big

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
ACR and that's probably the big

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.090 
ACR and that's probably the big
comparison<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.049> my<00:01:22.049> reasoning<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
comparison and my reasoning for that is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
comparison and my reasoning for that is
simply<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> scar<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> higher

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
simply because the scar has a higher

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.010 
simply because the scar has a higher
fire<00:01:25.439> rate<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
fire rate and it's not you know that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.560 
fire rate and it's not you know that
much<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> difference<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
much of a difference but it is

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.810 
much of a difference but it is
significant<00:01:30.710> because<00:01:31.710> getting<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> shot

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
significant because getting that shot

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
significant because getting that shot
off<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.329> bit<00:01:33.600> quicker<00:01:34.189> will<00:01:35.189> help

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
off just a little bit quicker will help

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
off just a little bit quicker will help
you<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> long<00:01:35.880> run<00:01:36.060> plus<00:01:36.540> i<00:01:36.900> believe<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you in the long run plus i believe the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.170 
you in the long run plus i believe the
scar<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
scar is a little bit better with a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.149 
scar is a little bit better with a
silencer<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.439> damaged

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
silencer just because of how damaged

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.760 
silencer just because of how damaged
drop<00:01:41.549> off<00:01:41.790> works<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.439> assault

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
drop off works with these two assault

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.950 
drop off works with these two assault
rifles<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> scar<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.540> better

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
rifles i think the scar is the better

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.249 
rifles i think the scar is the better
one<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.380> you're<00:01:46.500> using<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.860> silencer<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:48.259> since

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
one if you're using a silencer and since

very much recoil at all you can use the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
or extended mags and stability so Mike

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.520 
or extended mags and stability so Mike
stability<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> slayer<00:02:04.229> role

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
stability is more for a slayer role

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.010 
stability is more for a slayer role
which<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.030> role<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.390> playing<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.780> game

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
which is the role I'm playing this game

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
which is the role I'm playing this game
it<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.950> depends<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> play<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it just depends if you want to play as a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
it just depends if you want to play as a
more<00:02:09.780> stealthy<00:02:10.410> character<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.580> get<00:02:11.940> in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
more stealthy character or a get in

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.580 
more stealthy character or a get in
there<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
there and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.130 
there and
stuff<00:02:12.830> done<00:02:13.040> character<00:02:13.459> but<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.720> know<00:02:14.810> it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
stuff done character but you know it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.350 
stuff done character but you know it
really<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.620> go<00:02:15.800> either<00:02:16.340> way<00:02:16.519> your<00:02:16.879> role<00:02:17.090> on

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
really can go either way your role on

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.190 
really can go either way your role on
the<00:02:17.840> team<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.760> then<00:02:19.879> right<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:21.019> I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
the team and then right here is that I

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.839 
the team and then right here is that I
believe<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.830> was<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.099> first<00:02:22.280> deaths<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.760> the

believe it was my first deaths of the

and along with the scar and ACR debate

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.430 
and along with the scar and ACR debate
there's<00:02:32.000> always<00:02:32.239> been<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> debate<00:02:32.780> between<00:02:32.959> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
there's always been a debate between the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.780 
there's always been a debate between the
PP<00:02:33.860> 90<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.900> mp7<00:02:36.250> that's<00:02:37.250> another<00:02:37.519> one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
PP 90 and the mp7 that's another one

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.449 
PP 90 and the mp7 that's another one
that<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.959> know<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.410> really<00:02:39.620> hard<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.010> side<00:02:40.220> I

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
that you know it's really hard to side I

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.069 
that you know it's really hard to side I
use<00:02:40.700> both<00:02:41.360> i<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:43.510> class<00:02:44.510> where<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.840> use

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
use both i have a class where I use

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.380 
use both i have a class where I use
rapid<00:02:45.650> fire<00:02:45.799> extended<00:02:46.220> mags<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.700> PP<00:02:47.000> 90

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
rapid fire extended mags for the PP 90

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.780 
rapid fire extended mags for the PP 90
but<00:02:47.690> then<00:02:47.810> i<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.140> my<00:02:48.170> stealth<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.519> search

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
but then i have my stealth and search

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.890 
but then i have my stealth and search
and<00:02:49.910> destroy<00:02:50.030> class<00:02:50.569> with<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.500> mp7<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:53.360> once

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and destroy class with the mp7 it once

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.240 
and destroy class with the mp7 it once
again<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.230> comes<00:02:54.319> kinda<00:02:54.769> down<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.069> personal

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
again it comes kinda down to personal

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.229 
again it comes kinda down to personal
preference<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:57.370> yet<00:02:58.370> as<00:02:58.400> well<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:58.940> one<00:02:59.209> is

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
preference and yet as well which one is

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.039 
preference and yet as well which one is
easier<00:02:59.750> to<00:03:00.079> use<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:01.730> me<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:02.269> easier<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.930> use

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
easier to use for me the easier to use

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.890 
easier to use for me the easier to use
one<00:03:03.379> is<00:03:03.650> probably<00:03:04.190> going<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.910> be<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.180> PP<00:03:05.540> 90

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
one is probably going to be the PP 90

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.660 
one is probably going to be the PP 90
just<00:03:06.170> because<00:03:06.349> it's<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.590> really<00:03:06.799> good<00:03:06.890> spray

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
just because it's a really good spray

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.559 
just because it's a really good spray
weapon<00:03:08.510> mp7<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.970> probably<00:03:10.970> requires<00:03:11.329> a<00:03:11.450> little

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
weapon mp7 is probably requires a little

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.220 
weapon mp7 is probably requires a little
bit<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:11.930> accuracy<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:14.299> once<00:03:14.569> again<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:15.110> you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
bit more accuracy but once again if you

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.349 
bit more accuracy but once again if you
have<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.829> silenced<00:03:16.579> it's<00:03:16.790> going<00:03:17.120> to

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
have it silenced it's going to

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.539 
have it silenced it's going to
completely<00:03:17.720> destroy<00:03:18.260> people<00:03:18.799> especially<00:03:19.100> put

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
completely destroy people especially put

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.789 
completely destroy people especially put
silenced<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.209> range<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
silenced and range on it because the

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.370 
silenced and range on it because the
range<00:03:22.010> will<00:03:22.340> compensate<00:03:22.750> for<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.049> having<00:03:24.319> a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
range will compensate for you having a

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.960 
range will compensate for you having a
silence<00:03:24.769> around<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.100> which<00:03:25.220> reduces<00:03:25.700> range

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
silence around of which reduces range

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.340 
silence around of which reduces range
and<00:03:26.269> plus<00:03:26.389> gives<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.780> little<00:03:26.900> bit<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.139> boost

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
and plus gives you a little bit of boost

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.920 
and plus gives you a little bit of boost
on<00:03:27.590> top<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.130> making<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.540> silencer

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
on top of that making it so the silencer

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.170 
on top of that making it so the silencer
will<00:03:30.079> not<00:03:30.200> only<00:03:30.380> keep<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.709> stealthy<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:32.090> it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
will not only keep you stealthy but it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.839 
will not only keep you stealthy but it
won't<00:03:32.329> have<00:03:32.480> any<00:03:32.630> negative<00:03:33.139> effects<00:03:33.709> if<00:03:33.950> you

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
won't have any negative effects if you

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.789 
won't have any negative effects if you
want<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.120> go<00:03:35.239> with<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.019> stealth<00:03:36.349> route<00:03:36.620> with<00:03:36.769> a

want to go with the stealth route with a

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.660 
want to go with the stealth route with a
submachine<00:03:37.099> gun<00:03:38.410> that's<00:03:39.410> another<00:03:39.650> thing<00:03:39.920> that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
submachine gun that's another thing that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.449 
submachine gun that's another thing that
people<00:03:41.329> probably<00:03:42.319> don't<00:03:42.440> know<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.340> when

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
people probably don't know is that when

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.789 
people probably don't know is that when
you<00:03:43.549> have<00:03:43.780> well<00:03:44.780> let's<00:03:45.079> go<00:03:45.260> ahead<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.500> jump

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.500 
have any and what this means is if you
shoot<00:04:01.130> someone<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.700> they're<00:04:01.880> close<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.389> you

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
shoot someone and they're close to you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.930 
shoot someone and they're close to you
it's<00:04:03.079> going<00:04:03.349> to<00:04:03.410> do<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.560> certain<00:04:04.250> amount<00:04:04.489> of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
it's going to do a certain amount of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.170 
it's going to do a certain amount of
damage<00:04:05.329> and<00:04:05.510> at<00:04:06.380> its<00:04:06.560> maximum<00:04:07.190> range<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.880> from

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
damage and at its maximum range and from

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.000 
damage and at its maximum range and from
anything<00:04:08.359> behind<00:04:08.599> that<00:04:08.900> it's<00:04:09.349> going<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.889> be

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
anything behind that it's going to be

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.420 
anything behind that it's going to be
doing<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.639> lot<00:04:10.819> less<00:04:11.419> damage<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:13.190> lot<00:04:13.400> of

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
doing a lot less damage and a lot of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.949 
doing a lot less damage and a lot of
people<00:04:13.519> don't<00:04:13.819> really<00:04:13.940> figure<00:04:14.329> that<00:04:14.510> in<00:04:14.690> and

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
people don't really figure that in and

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.990 
people don't really figure that in and
it<00:04:15.109> applies<00:04:15.680> mostly<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.310> some<00:04:16.489> machine<00:04:16.789> guns

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
it applies mostly to some machine guns

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.219 
it applies mostly to some machine guns
like<00:04:17.810> if<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.079> look<00:04:18.260> at<00:04:18.470> mp7<00:04:19.659> well<00:04:20.659> let's<00:04:20.930> let's

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
like if you look at mp7 well let's let's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.959 
like if you look at mp7 well let's let's
go<00:04:21.349> with<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> UMP<00:04:22.099> UMP<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.610> great<00:04:22.849> example

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
go with the UMP UMP is a great example

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.969 
go with the UMP UMP is a great example
at<00:04:23.419> close<00:04:23.659> range<00:04:23.960> it's<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.260> two<00:04:24.469> bullet<00:04:24.800> kill

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
at close range it's a two bullet kill

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:25.780 
at close range it's a two bullet kill
but<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> long<00:04:25.490> way

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
but a long way

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.780 
but a long way
it's<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> five<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.620> if<00:04:28.220> you're<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.430> little<00:04:28.670> bit

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
it's a five so if you're a little bit

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.940 
it's a five so if you're a little bit
farther<00:04:29.000> away<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.630> going<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.110> make<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.500> about

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
farther away it's going to make it about

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.100 
farther away it's going to make it about
two<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.520> half<00:04:31.550> times<00:04:31.940> harder<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.870> get<00:04:32.960> the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
two and a half times harder to get the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.440 
two and a half times harder to get the
kill<00:04:33.320> plus<00:04:33.740> all<00:04:33.980> that<00:04:34.010> added<00:04:34.490> recoil<00:04:34.880> that's

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
kill plus all that added recoil that's

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.970 
kill plus all that added recoil that's
why<00:04:35.630> some<00:04:35.930> machine<00:04:36.200> guns<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.590> game<00:04:36.800> are

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
why some machine guns in this game are

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.210 
why some machine guns in this game are
really<00:04:37.370> only<00:04:37.520> for<00:04:37.970> close<00:04:38.810> range<00:04:38.990> or<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:40.010> you

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
really only for close range or if you

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.380 
really only for close range or if you
have<00:04:40.280> some<00:04:40.520> machine<00:04:40.790> gun<00:04:40.910> with<00:04:41.030> very<00:04:41.240> little

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
have some machine gun with very little

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.480 
have some machine gun with very little
recoil<00:04:41.840> like<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.170> mp7<00:04:42.410> that's<00:04:43.040> why<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.220> mp7

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
recoil like the mp7 that's why the mp7

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.760 
recoil like the mp7 that's why the mp7
so<00:04:43.940> good<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.420> then<00:04:44.450> with<00:04:45.410> assault<00:04:45.710> rifles

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
so good and then with assault rifles

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.710 
so good and then with assault rifles
they<00:04:46.220> also<00:04:46.400> had<00:04:46.700> damaged<00:04:47.000> drop<00:04:47.210> off<00:04:47.390> but<00:04:47.600> it's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
they also had damaged drop off but it's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.140 
they also had damaged drop off but it's
not<00:04:47.900> nearly<00:04:48.200> as<00:04:48.380> noticeable<00:04:48.830> like<00:04:49.790> for<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
not nearly as noticeable like for the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.710 
not nearly as noticeable like for the
scar<00:04:50.450> it's<00:04:51.160> 3525<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.820> it's<00:04:53.210> either<00:04:53.360> going<00:04:53.600> to

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
scar it's 3525 so it's either going to

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.210 
scar it's 3525 so it's either going to
be<00:04:53.980> three<00:04:54.980> or<00:04:55.250> four<00:04:55.610> bullets<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:57.100> there's<00:04:58.100> a

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
be three or four bullets and there's a

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.190 
be three or four bullets and there's a
point<00:04:58.520> in<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.850> middle<00:04:59.180> where<00:04:59.840> it<00:04:59.930> decides

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
point in the middle where it decides

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.020 
point in the middle where it decides
between<00:05:00.440> three<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.710> four<00:05:00.980> bullets<00:05:01.340> Plus<00:05:01.820> that

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
between three and four bullets Plus that

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.990 
between three and four bullets Plus that
doesn't<00:05:02.360> account<00:05:02.870> for<00:05:03.050> head<00:05:03.470> shots<00:05:03.500> which<00:05:04.070> if

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
doesn't account for head shots which if

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.420 
doesn't account for head shots which if
you<00:05:05.330> get<00:05:05.420> a<00:05:05.450> head<00:05:05.660> shot<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:06.230> has<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> 1.5

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
you get a head shot it has a 1.5

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.850 
you get a head shot it has a 1.5
multiplayer<00:05:08.120> which<00:05:08.330> means<00:05:08.600> instead<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.470> doing

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
multiplayer which means instead of doing

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.880 
multiplayer which means instead of doing
35<00:05:10.490> damage<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.210> would<00:05:11.390> do<00:05:11.540> one<00:05:12.230> half<00:05:12.530> times

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
35 damage it would do one half times

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.540 
35 damage it would do one half times
that<00:05:14.050> so<00:05:15.050> jumping<00:05:15.410> back<00:05:15.650> when<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.340> have<00:05:16.460> the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
that so jumping back when you have the

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.960 
that so jumping back when you have the
silencer<00:05:17.030> on<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.210> makes<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.970> range

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
silencer on it makes it so that range

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.960 
silencer on it makes it so that range
where<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:20.840> drops<00:05:21.110> down<00:05:21.260> to<00:05:21.410> 25<00:05:21.920> comes<00:05:22.430> sooner

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
where it drops down to 25 comes sooner

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.000 
where it drops down to 25 comes sooner
so<00:05:23.750> when<00:05:23.900> you<00:05:23.960> have<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.110> silencer<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.680> weapon

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
so when you have a silencer on a weapon

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.760 
so when you have a silencer on a weapon
it<00:05:25.250> makes<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:25.880> so<00:05:26.090> at<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.540> medium<00:05:27.530> range

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
it makes it so at a medium range

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.080 
it makes it so at a medium range
depending<00:05:28.340> on<00:05:28.460> what<00:05:28.550> kind<00:05:28.640> of<00:05:28.730> weapon<00:05:28.970> you're

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
depending on what kind of weapon you're

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.740 
depending on what kind of weapon you're
using<00:05:29.270> it<00:05:29.540> will<00:05:29.660> take<00:05:29.840> one<00:05:30.140> extra<00:05:30.500> bullet<00:05:31.750> so

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
using it will take one extra bullet so

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.360 
using it will take one extra bullet so
those<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:33.650> that<00:05:33.800> may<00:05:33.980> not<00:05:34.220> have

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
those of you that may not have

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.300 
those of you that may not have
understood<00:05:34.490> how<00:05:35.200> damaged<00:05:36.200> worked<00:05:36.470> with<00:05:36.770> guns

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
understood how damaged worked with guns

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.910 
understood how damaged worked with guns
and<00:05:37.640> silencers<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.390> hope<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:39.110> helped<00:05:39.500> out<00:05:39.650> a

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
and silencers I hope that helped out a

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.140 
and silencers I hope that helped out a
little<00:05:40.430> bit<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.730> have<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:40.910> better

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
little bit you have a better

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.000 
little bit you have a better
understanding<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:43.430> in<00:05:44.360> this<00:05:44.600> game<00:05:45.010> silencers

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
understanding and in this game silencers

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.700 
understanding and in this game silencers
are<00:05:46.130> usually<00:05:46.670> the<00:05:47.000> way<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.180> go<00:05:47.420> I<00:05:47.710> recommend

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
are usually the way to go I recommend

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.820 
are usually the way to go I recommend
them<00:05:48.800> for<00:05:48.830> almost<00:05:49.160> any<00:05:49.430> class<00:05:49.760> because<00:05:50.830> you

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830
