usually<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.500> D<00:01:17.009> rings<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> attach<00:01:18.060> them

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
usually have D rings when I attach them

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.390 
usually have D rings when I attach them
to<00:01:18.479> my<00:01:18.509> lights<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:19.020> super<00:01:19.290> bees<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:20.159> some

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to my lights or super bees I got some

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.590 
to my lights or super bees I got some
from<00:01:20.549> her<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> I've<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.060> been<00:01:21.150> lazy<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
from her and I've just been lazy and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
from her and I've just been lazy and
haven't<00:01:21.930> put<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.950> do

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
haven't put them on there but I do

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
haven't put them on there but I do
definitely<00:01:23.790> recommend<00:01:24.210> adding<00:01:24.420> D<00:01:24.720> rings<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
definitely recommend adding D rings to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.690 
definitely recommend adding D rings to
your<00:01:25.259> bags<00:01:25.439> before<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.189> straps<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
your bags before these straps just

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 
your bags before these straps just
because<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> much<00:01:27.750> smoother<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
because they go on so much smoother and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560 
because they go on so much smoother and
easier<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.759> doesn't<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.299> give<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
easier and it doesn't kind of give that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
easier and it doesn't kind of give that
little<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.960> scrunched<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.650> look<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
little like scrunched up look there so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.160 
little like scrunched up look there so
I'll<00:01:33.000> definitely<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.390> putting<00:01:33.600> mine<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.840> there

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
I'll definitely be putting mine on there

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
I'll definitely be putting mine on there
