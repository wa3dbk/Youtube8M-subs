00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.370
 Hmm 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.260
 That herb 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.770
 That is the herb that I thought all the way began involved in reverse run 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.200
 It does not mean that you run in reverse 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.310
 Just what it is 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.310
 I have always been thinking 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 4 people have granny's champ 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.030
 In such a place, it is also in the tray that doubles as training 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.510
 Originally or only novice's me that with various peel off 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.510
 Where people are studying 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 Hmm 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.370
 Hume 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370
 me 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 Not too much 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.870
 What would it be? 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.300
 His clay Deployment put both feet of the history of the Japanese 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.140
 It is said that you can grow up and reflect 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.140
 Thinking is the stage 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.750
 Hmm 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.440
 Hmm 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.440
 me 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.400
 dee 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:09.709
 n 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:12.030
 In terms of coloring, such as Kyoto is also the case, but that Japanese is such natural 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.260
 Ancient coloring 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.610
 I have not been conscious of that for a while, but naturally 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.080
 That element is coming in so much like this 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.080
 To wait 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 like 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 It is rebuilt 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.980
 First of all a little well documentary 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.550
 In the close way 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.590
 I thought I wanted to take that but I'm really there 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.550
 after 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.730
 Also the moving texture 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.800
 that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.270
 A little 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.780
 Poi Toka too super real because I thought the other Do a little if 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:15.290
 Or rather simply was Murphy there 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:18.670
 I think I wonder if fall Ppoku people in order to better beyond the little retro texture 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.670
 We had a talk like that 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.340
 This time for the first time 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.770
 Use the total pattern handle 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.030
 Fall and winter many times 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.680
 Motor of Leap grinded to say whether the dead leaves Pattern Men's camouflage 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.410
 I wonder if I will use it for a moment 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.230
 Hmm 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.310
 Yup 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.569
 me 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.590
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:09.030
 There is a camp 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:13.410
 There are Togakushi Shrine and finally four people understand that it's a reverse run postcard 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.920
 It is said that it will go to run once more, and it is an end to that it is a farmer by the thought 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.920
 Voyeur 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.120
 voodoo 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.120
