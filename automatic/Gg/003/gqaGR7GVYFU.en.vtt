to be looking at the mouse one of the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.730 
to be looking at the mouse one of the
two<00:00:14.670> primary<00:00:15.059> ways<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.260> interface<00:00:16.710> with

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
two primary ways that we interface with

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.760 
two primary ways that we interface with
the<00:00:17.279> computer<00:00:17.430> system<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.869> other<00:00:19.020> course

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the computer system the other course

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.460 
the computer system the other course
being<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> keyboard<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:21.060> data<00:00:21.359> input<00:00:21.960> but

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
being the keyboard for data input but

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650 
being the keyboard for data input but
the<00:00:22.560> mouse<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.510> we

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the mouse is actually the way that we

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380 
the mouse is actually the way that we
tell<00:00:25.590> our<00:00:25.800> computer<00:00:26.400> which<00:00:26.609> programs<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
tell our computer which programs to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.040 
tell our computer which programs to
start<00:00:27.740> which<00:00:28.740> ones<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> open<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.539> can

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
start which ones to open and we can

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450 
start which ones to open and we can
modify<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> settings<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> our

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
modify a lot of the settings in our

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
modify a lot of the settings in our
programs<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.149> well<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> mouse<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:35.010> small

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
programs as well the mouse is this small

programs as well the mouse is this small
device<00:00:35.520> right<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.000> typically<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.840> has<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
device right here typically it has a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.889 
device right here typically it has a
core<00:00:37.320> drawing<00:00:37.559> off<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:38.010> off<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:39.000> many<00:00:41.899> mice

core drawing off see off that many mice
now<00:00:43.260> they<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.920> any<00:00:44.070> court<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.489> all

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
now they don't have any court at all

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
now they don't have any court at all
it'll<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:44.969> look<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.840> plastic<00:00:46.170> thing

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

sitting there one thing that we need to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.290 
sitting there one thing that we need to
understand<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.520> mouse<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.030> there<00:00:51.780> are

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
things I can do with just a right button

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.140 
things I can do with just a right button
the<00:03:19.860> other<00:03:20.070> thing<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.550> wanted<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.910> show

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.979 
you can drag it you can move it around
all<00:03:40.320> right<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> whole<00:03:41.459> program<00:03:42.390> can<00:03:42.959> be

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
all right so the whole program can be

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.540 
all right so the whole program can be
moved<00:03:43.290> around<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.890> move<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.160> right<00:03:44.370> over

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
moved around you can move it right over

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.490 
moved around you can move it right over
to<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.850> side<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.330> you're<00:03:45.989> doing<00:03:46.200> something

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
to drag it back around as well so that's

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.510 
to drag it back around as well so that's
this<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:00.930> basically

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
this is basically

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.400 
this is basically
one<00:04:03.520> of<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.700> primary<00:04:03.880> ways<00:04:04.240> that<00:04:04.630> we

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
one of the primary ways that we

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.770 
one of the primary ways that we
interface<00:04:05.950> with<00:04:05.980> our<00:04:06.250> computer<00:04:06.910> selecting

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
interface with our computer selecting

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.420 
interface with our computer selecting
programs<00:04:08.230> telling<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.890> computer<00:04:09.160> which

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430
