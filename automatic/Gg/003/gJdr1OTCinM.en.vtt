00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this problem is we've done what a lot of

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.539 
this problem is we've done what a lot of
channels<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.479> done<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.899> far<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:53.130> we've

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
channels have done so far in that we've

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.190 
to people who are on the friends list

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
if we ever get in these spaces but one

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.850 
if we ever get in these spaces but one
thing<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.600> keep<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> mind<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.530> isn't

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
thing to keep in mind is that this isn't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.200 
thing to keep in mind is that this isn't
a<00:02:25.920> guarantee<00:02:26.100> you're<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.060> in
