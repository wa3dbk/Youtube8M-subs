so<00:00:49.570> let's<00:00:49.600> do<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:49.930> from<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.110> piano<00:00:50.410> sound

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
so let's do this from the piano sound

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.180 
so let's do this from the piano sound
now<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:52.150> I'll<00:00:52.239> explain<00:00:52.510> this<00:00:52.690> sheet<00:00:53.020> so<00:00:53.470> the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
now and I'll explain this sheet so the

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.950 
now and I'll explain this sheet so the
lower<00:00:54.370> case<00:00:54.640> stuff<00:00:54.910> is<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.270> right<00:00:55.510> hand<00:00:55.840> so

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
lower case stuff is the right hand so

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.290 
lower case stuff is the right hand so

holds<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.490> out<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:23.350> didn't<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.130> for

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
holds that out I didn't have it on for

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.160 
holds that out I didn't have it on for
the<00:02:24.340> since<00:02:24.640> sounded<00:02:25.060> kind<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.270> like<00:02:25.360> sometimes

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the since sounded kind of like sometimes

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.200 
the since sounded kind of like sometimes
I<00:02:26.350> don't<00:02:26.680> sound<00:02:27.460> quite<00:02:27.580> as<00:02:27.670> good<00:02:27.880> when<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.060> had

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
I don't sound quite as good when I had

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:39.160 
I don't sound quite as good when I had
the<00:02:28.330> same<00:02:28.630> pedal<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.050> but

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.500 

cool<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.560> that's<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:42.090> mimics

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
cool so that's kind of like that mimics

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.290
