hasn't been clean in a while that's why

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.970 
hasn't been clean in a while that's why
probably<00:03:08.200> notice<00:03:08.409> some<00:03:08.560> spots<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.560> hood

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
probably notice some spots but the hood

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.339 
probably notice some spots but the hood
does<00:03:12.190> stay<00:03:12.430> open<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.109> little<00:03:14.109> design

underneath<00:03:14.799> unusual<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.799> see<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.579> I

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
underneath unusual and we can see that I

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.830 
underneath unusual and we can see that I
believe<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> 12<00:03:20.500> cylinder<00:03:21.329> has<00:03:22.329> been<00:03:22.660> lis

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
believe it is a 12 cylinder has been lis

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.520 
believe it is a 12 cylinder has been lis
written<00:03:23.169> in<00:03:23.349> the<00:03:23.650> middle<00:03:25.829> looks<00:03:26.829> really<00:03:27.160> nice

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
written in the middle looks really nice

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.140 
written in the middle looks really nice
it<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.680> technically<00:03:30.370> one<00:03:30.669> big<00:03:30.879> piece<00:03:31.090> of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
it is technically one big piece of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.470 
it is technically one big piece of
plastic<00:03:31.419> but<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.919> very<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.700> executed<00:03:33.730> so

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
plastic but it's very well executed so

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.289 
plastic but it's very well executed so

you wouldn't notice so the warning

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.500 
you wouldn't notice so the warning
signals<00:03:37.750> there<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:39.090> think<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.359> plenty

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
signals there I think this is plenty

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.030 
where it's supposed to be very very nice
it<00:04:48.250> is<00:04:48.280> all<00:04:48.580> black<00:04:48.820> in<00:04:49.060> here<00:04:49.350> but<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:50.440> car<00:04:50.740> can

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
it is all black in here but this car can

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.980 
it is all black in here but this car can
come<00:04:51.280> in<00:04:51.460> all<00:04:51.610> black<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.510> does<00:04:52.780> make

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
come in all black so that does make

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.360 
come in all black so that does make
sense<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.930> has<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.260> automatic<00:04:56.440> transmission

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
sense it has the automatic transmission

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.050 
sense it has the automatic transmission
that<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:58.740> noticed<00:04:59.740> has<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.130> interesting

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
that I noticed has a interesting

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.810 
that I noticed has a interesting
resemblance<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:02.050> one<00:05:02.320> in<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.820> Volkswagen

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
resemblance to one in a Volkswagen

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.950 
resemblance to one in a Volkswagen
Touareg<00:05:05.850> but<00:05:06.850> then<00:05:07.030> again<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.330> Bentley<00:05:07.780> is

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
Touareg but then again a Bentley is

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.480 
Touareg but then again a Bentley is
owned<00:05:08.230> by<00:05:08.440> Volkswagen<00:05:08.650> or<00:05:09.580> yes<00:05:10.420> Volkswagen<00:05:11.490> so

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
owned by Volkswagen or yes Volkswagen so

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.770 
owned by Volkswagen or yes Volkswagen so
that<00:05:12.670> would<00:05:12.760> make<00:05:12.940> sense<00:05:13.830> no<00:05:14.830> rear<00:05:15.070> seats<00:05:15.370> as

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
that would make sense no rear seats as

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.580 
that would make sense no rear seats as
it's<00:05:16.780> taken<00:05:17.110> out<00:05:17.200> to<00:05:17.470> save<00:05:17.740> weight<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:23.530> move

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
it's taken out to save weight to move

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.500 
it's taken out to save weight to move
