coming<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> motor<00:01:14.520> hopefully<00:01:14.940> bump<00:01:15.150> up

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
coming into the motor hopefully bump up

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.880 
coming into the motor hopefully bump up
some<00:01:15.390> horsepower<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:16.050> put<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.500> Camaro<00:01:16.770> on

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
some horsepower we put the Camaro on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.640 
some horsepower we put the Camaro on
dyno<00:01:17.540> after<00:01:18.540> doing<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:18.960> parts<00:01:19.440> well

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
dyno after doing all these parts well

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.990 
dyno after doing all these parts well
but<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.160> did<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.460> quite<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.730> bit<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.940> an
