Jim starrett and we're talking about
spiders<00:00:25.119> and<00:00:25.390> we<00:00:25.509> have<00:00:25.630> spiders<00:00:26.169> to<00:00:26.349> play<00:00:26.560> with

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
spiders and we have spiders to play with

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.710 
spiders and we have spiders to play with
before<00:00:27.130> we<00:00:27.220> get<00:00:27.339> to<00:00:27.489> the<00:00:27.609> spiders<00:00:28.060> talk<00:00:28.539> to<00:00:28.659> us

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
before we get to the spiders talk to us

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.259 
before we get to the spiders talk to us
about<00:00:28.869> your<00:00:29.050> research<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:30.460> lab<00:00:30.669> studies<00:00:31.119> the

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
about your research my lab studies the

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.850 
about your research my lab studies the
evolution<00:00:31.359> of<00:00:31.779> spiders<00:00:32.200> and<00:00:32.410> there's<00:00:32.529> and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
evolution of spiders and there's and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.430 
evolution of spiders and there's and
spider<00:00:33.130> silks<00:00:33.490> which<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:34.240> web's<00:00:34.440> exactly

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
spider silks which is the web's exactly

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.470 
spider silks which is the web's exactly
exactly<00:00:35.620> what<00:00:36.430> are<00:00:36.490> you<00:00:36.580> looking<00:00:37.000> at<00:00:37.150> what<00:00:37.420> are

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
exactly what are you looking at what are

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.850 
exactly what are you looking at what are
you<00:00:37.570> looking<00:00:37.900> for<00:00:38.200> when<00:00:38.440> you<00:00:38.530> do<00:00:38.680> your

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
you looking for when you do your

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.590 
you looking for when you do your
research<00:00:39.190> well<00:00:40.000> there's<00:00:40.330> kind<00:00:40.510> of<00:00:40.540> two

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
research well there's kind of two

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.810 
research well there's kind of two
aspects<00:00:41.110> one<00:00:41.260> is<00:00:41.320> we<00:00:41.560> try<00:00:41.740> to<00:00:41.800> figure<00:00:42.010> out<00:00:42.130> sort

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
aspects one is we try to figure out sort

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.580 
aspects one is we try to figure out sort
of<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.060> performance<00:00:43.630> properties<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.320> spider

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
of the performance properties of spider

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.410 
of the performance properties of spider
silk<00:00:44.680> sort<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.430> know<00:00:45.490> how<00:00:45.760> strong<00:00:46.150> how

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
silk sort of you know how strong how

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.330 
silk sort of you know how strong how
stretchy<00:00:46.780> how<00:00:47.080> tough<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:47.500> it<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.310> other

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
stretchy how tough is it and the other

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.070 
stretchy how tough is it and the other
aspect<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.970> we<00:00:49.150> don't<00:00:49.330> want<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.600> understand

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
aspect is we don't want to understand

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.320 
aspect is we don't want to understand
how<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.590> it<00:00:50.740> made<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.580> most<00:00:51.970> people<00:00:52.090> don't

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
how is it made so most people don't

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.150 
how is it made so most people don't
realize<00:00:52.630> this<00:00:52.840> but<00:00:52.900> spider<00:00:53.590> silk<00:00:53.830> is<00:00:53.890> made<00:00:54.070> of

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
realize this but spider silk is made of

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.340 
realize this but spider silk is made of
protein<00:00:54.610> really<00:00:55.300> proteins<00:00:55.750> are<00:00:55.870> encoded<00:00:56.020> by

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
protein really proteins are encoded by

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.980 
protein really proteins are encoded by
genes<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.430> we<00:00:57.550> can<00:00:57.700> clone<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.330> genes<00:00:58.660> that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
genes so we can clone the genes that

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.590 
genes so we can clone the genes that
actually<00:00:59.680> encode<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.760> blueprints<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.480> the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
actually encode the blueprints of the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.289 
actually encode the blueprints of the
spiders<00:01:01.900> have<00:01:01.990> to<00:01:02.140> tell<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.530> my<00:01:03.370> family<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:03.970> I

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
spiders have to tell you my family and I

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.110 
spiders have to tell you my family and I
love<00:01:05.140> spiders<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.890> love<00:01:06.040> spider<00:01:06.340> webs<00:01:06.610> we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
love spiders and love spider webs we

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.399 
love spiders and love spider webs we
have<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.270> certain<00:01:07.570> location<00:01:07.659> in<00:01:08.110> our<00:01:08.230> home

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
have a certain location in our home

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.840 
have a certain location in our home
where<00:01:08.620> there<00:01:08.800> are<00:01:08.860> spider<00:01:09.190> webs<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.640> think

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
where there are spider webs we think

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.090 
where there are spider webs we think
they're<00:01:10.000> miracles<00:01:10.390> oh<00:01:10.600> we<00:01:11.290> really<00:01:11.320> do<00:01:11.920> think

Black Widow well the Western Black Widow
is<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.670> spider<00:01:27.970> probably<00:01:28.690> pretty<00:01:28.960> familiar<00:01:29.050> to

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
is a spider probably pretty familiar to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.770 
is a spider probably pretty familiar to
most<00:01:30.040> people<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.460> live<00:01:30.700> around<00:01:30.820> Southern

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
most people that live around Southern

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.680 
most people that live around Southern
California<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.490> they're<00:01:33.640> they're<00:01:34.150> quite

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
California so they're they're quite

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.710 
California so they're they're quite
common<00:01:35.140> they<00:01:35.530> come<00:01:35.740> out<00:01:35.860> at<00:01:35.979> night<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:36.720> they

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
common they come out at night and they

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.170 
common they come out at night and they
make<00:01:37.990> fabulous<00:01:38.530> fabulous<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.430> do<00:01:39.580> they<00:01:39.790> yeah

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
make fabulous fabulous so do they yeah

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.050 
make fabulous fabulous so do they yeah
now<00:01:40.600> i<00:01:40.930> must<00:01:41.350> say<00:01:41.560> they<00:01:41.890> are<00:01:42.130> poisonous<00:01:42.909> is

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
now i must say they are poisonous is

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.899 
now i must say they are poisonous is
that<00:01:43.240> right<00:01:43.450> yes<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:44.290> no<00:01:45.100> touch<00:01:45.310> nearly<00:01:45.700> all

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
that right yes so no touch nearly all

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.570 
that right yes so no touch nearly all
virtually<00:01:46.900> all<00:01:46.990> spiders<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.500> venom<00:01:47.950> but

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
virtually all spiders have venom but

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.609 
virtually all spiders have venom but
most<00:01:49.000> spiders<00:01:49.299> their<00:01:49.690> Venom's<00:01:50.020> don't<00:01:50.350> have<00:01:50.530> an

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
most spiders their Venom's don't have an

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.410 
most spiders their Venom's don't have an
act<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:51.070> aren't<00:01:51.460> actually<00:01:51.729> active<00:01:52.060> against

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
act on aren't actually active against

people okay but black widows widows
general<00:01:56.350> actually<00:01:56.560> widow<00:01:56.979> spiders<00:01:57.400> there's<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
general actually widow spiders there's a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.940 
general actually widow spiders there's a
component<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:58.659> their<00:01:58.840> venom<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.320> actually

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
component in their venom that actually

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.460 
component in their venom that actually
works<00:02:00.189> on<00:02:00.479> vertebrates<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:02.260> why<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
works on vertebrates so that's why it

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.810 
works on vertebrates so that's why it
works<00:02:02.650> on<00:02:02.770> our<00:02:02.920> new<00:02:03.130> rod<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.580> what<00:02:03.700> what

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
works on our new rod so what what

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.580 
works on our new rod so what what
happened<00:02:04.180> if<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.360> didn't<00:02:04.720> um<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:05.409> would<00:02:05.470> be

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
happened if you didn't um it would be

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.669 
happened if you didn't um it would be
very<00:02:05.880> painful<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:08.170> know<00:02:08.259> if<00:02:08.409> you<00:02:08.500> get

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
very painful and you know if you get

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.650 
very painful and you know if you get
enough<00:02:09.069> venom<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.940> probably<00:02:10.270> would

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
enough venom in you you probably would

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.210 
enough venom in you you probably would
want<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.929> go<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> local<00:02:11.680> doctor<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.130> get

Diego ought to us about the importance

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.120 
Diego ought to us about the importance
of<00:02:55.480> spiders<00:02:55.989> when<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> find<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.620> spider<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.010> my

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
of spiders when I find a spider in my

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.309 
of spiders when I find a spider in my
house<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.760> somehow<00:02:58.540> capture<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.140> take<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
house I somehow capture it and take it

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.979 
house I somehow capture it and take it
outside<00:02:59.560> just<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.459> my<00:03:00.670> mind<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.269> know<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.900> they

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
outside just in my mind I know that they

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.710 
outside just in my mind I know that they
are<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.200> important<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.739> for<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.099> ecosystem

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
are so important just for the ecosystem

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.589 
are so important just for the ecosystem
exactly<00:03:04.720> illus<00:03:04.989> well<00:03:05.819> spiders<00:03:06.819> their<00:03:07.390> main

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
exactly illus well spiders their main

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.350 
exactly illus well spiders their main
role<00:03:07.870> what<00:03:08.319> they<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:09.730> eat<00:03:09.910> insects

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
role what they do is they eat insects

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.440 
role what they do is they eat insects
and<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.470> that's<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.310> very<00:03:12.730> valuable<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.239> if<00:03:13.330> all

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and so that's a very valuable so if all

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.479 
and so that's a very valuable so if all
the<00:03:13.569> spiders<00:03:13.780> were<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.140> disappear<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:15.459> know

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
the spiders were to disappear you know

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.240 
the spiders were to disappear you know
we<00:03:15.940> would<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.599> sort<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.170> washed<00:03:17.830> we're

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
we would be just sort of washed we're

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.120 
we would be just sort of washed we're
all<00:03:18.489> over<00:03:18.790> run<00:03:19.060> exactly<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.350> spiders<00:03:20.829> play<00:03:21.100> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
all over run exactly so spiders play a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.530 
all over run exactly so spiders play a
very<00:03:21.340> important<00:03:21.730> role<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:22.060> where<00:03:22.239> were<00:03:22.390> they

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
very important role that where were they

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.479 
very important role that where were they
they<00:03:23.170> eat<00:03:23.410> insects<00:03:23.890> but<00:03:24.010> on<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.280> other<00:03:24.370> hand

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
they eat insects but on the other hand

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.699 
they eat insects but on the other hand
spiders<00:03:25.299> are<00:03:25.390> also<00:03:25.600> they<00:03:25.989> themselves<00:03:26.200> are

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
spiders are also they themselves are

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.990 
spiders are also they themselves are
