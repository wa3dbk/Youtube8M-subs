00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hi I'm grant from creeks I'm here to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.499 
hi I'm grant from creeks I'm here to
talk<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.410> our<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.430> ceiling<00:00:05.879> loudspeaker

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
talk about our in ceiling loudspeaker

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.960 
talk about our in ceiling loudspeaker
which<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.080> atmospherics<00:00:07.859> which<00:00:08.730> fits

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
which is the atmospherics which fits

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.940 
which is the atmospherics which fits
into<00:00:09.269> our<00:00:09.300> design<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.170> home<00:00:10.620> cinema

largest<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:15.059> ceiling<00:00:15.509> speaker<00:00:16.670> comes<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
largest in ceiling speaker comes in a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.310 
largest in ceiling speaker comes in a
standard<00:00:18.210> white<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.869> see<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.199> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
standard white as you can see that it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.519 
standard white as you can see that it's
paintable<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.390> also<00:00:21.539> has<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> back<00:00:22.080> box<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
paintable and it also has a back box of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.230 
paintable and it also has a back box of
standard<00:00:22.980> which<00:00:23.220> stops<00:00:23.580> dust<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> debris

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
standard which stops dust and debris

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
standard which stops dust and debris
from<00:00:24.600> entering<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.439> speaker<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
from entering the the speaker and the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.480 
from entering the the speaker and the
driver<00:00:26.720> also<00:00:27.720> stops<00:00:28.109> sound<00:00:28.769> transference<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
driver also stops sound transference to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
driver also stops sound transference to
other<00:00:29.670> rooms<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> house<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
other rooms of the house and and it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
other rooms of the house and and it
gives<00:00:32.009> us<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.250> 9<00:00:32.669> volume<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> operate<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.780> as

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
gives us a 9 volume to operate in as

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.380 
gives us a 9 volume to operate in as
well<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.040> speaker<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
well so with this speaker you know it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.670 
well so with this speaker you know it
will<00:00:36.510> sound<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> same<00:00:36.989> from<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.230> installed

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
will sound the same from one installed

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.950 
will sound the same from one installed
to<00:00:37.860> another<00:00:38.210> whereas<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.329> open<00:00:39.600> baffle

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
speaker or infinite baffle speaker will

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.520 
speaker or infinite baffle speaker will
sound<00:00:42.149> quite<00:00:42.360> different<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.020> install<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
sound quite different for one install to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.350 
sound quite different for one install to
the<00:00:43.590> other<00:00:43.680> depending<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> roof

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the other depending on what the roof

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.590 
the other depending on what the roof
cavity<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.480> bit

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
cavity is like it's a little bit

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450 
cavity is like it's a little bit
different<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.350> intend<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> approach<00:00:50.160> things

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
different we intend to approach things

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
different we intend to approach things
in<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> different<00:00:50.820> way<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.289> rather<00:00:52.289> than<00:00:52.440> having

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
in a different way so rather than having

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.700 
in a different way so rather than having
a<00:00:52.829> tweeter<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> stick<00:00:53.850> we're<00:00:54.149> using

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
a tweeter on a stick we're using

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.950 
a tweeter on a stick we're using
separate<00:00:55.710> drivers<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.600> separate

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
separate drivers as you can see separate

base<00:01:00.960> driver<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:02.039> equinox<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
base driver is from our equinox and in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
base driver is from our equinox and in
fact<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> cabinet<00:01:04.379> volume<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:04.949> similar

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
fact the cabinet volume is very similar

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.210 
fact the cabinet volume is very similar
to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> equinox<00:01:06.590> high<00:01:07.590> frequency<00:01:07.979> driver

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.910 
to the equinox high frequency driver
does<00:01:08.970> pivot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> course<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.590> using<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
does pivot of course and we are using a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
does pivot of course and we are using a
smaller<00:01:11.189> base<00:01:11.400> driver<00:01:11.729> which<00:01:11.909> means<00:01:12.180> although

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
smaller base driver which means although

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
smaller base driver which means although
it's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> smaller<00:01:13.740> driver<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.430> more

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it's a smaller driver we have more

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.670 
it's a smaller driver we have more
control<00:01:14.820> over<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.240> base<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
control over the base because the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.230 
control over the base because the
cabinet<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> enclosed<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.939> goes<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> bit

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
cabinet is enclosed so it goes a bit

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
cabinet is enclosed so it goes a bit
deeper<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.290> more<00:01:19.470> controlled<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> again

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
deeper and is more controlled and again

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.969 
deeper and is more controlled and again
an<00:01:20.729> input<00:01:21.030> baffle<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.200> reason<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.860> using

an input baffle the reason for using
separate<00:01:23.790> drivers<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.509> simply<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
separate drivers is simply because the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.090 
separate drivers is simply because the
