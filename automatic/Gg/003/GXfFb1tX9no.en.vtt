00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.450
 hello races welcome to a new 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.270
 video of our practical workshop 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.980
 devices and modern life sure that 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.210
 have you ever asked yourself when 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.220
 we have mobile devices that 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.410
 little by little they are incorporating taking 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.660
 part of our life are becoming 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.579
 hollow and good are taking over 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.169
 plots that were formerly 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.689
 reserved for other types of devices such as 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.969
 it can be a computer comes to the thread 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.379
 all this that we are often in 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.120
 one with spores engrossed one 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.590
 whatsapp conversation or want 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.050
 answer emails from a 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.440
 mobile that many times the keyboard because 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.740
 the tactile keyboards are between 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.880
 quotes and in some way limited to 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.739
 the time to write then the little screen 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.210
 it's small but there are solutions even 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.760
 for this there are two types of solutions 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.620
 that there are what are called cables 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.239
 or trellis the changes are of what is 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.940
 this this cable that I have here in my 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.280
 hand that has one side 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.950
 microusb connector that goes to the device 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.479
 mobile therefore has a usb port or 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.520
 there is also this that this is 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.860
 an extended version of the otg cable this one 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.330
 It has three usb ports because everything comes 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.299
 this because we can do things 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.549
 how to get here, we plug it in 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.520
 we take the mobile device we look for the 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.460
 connector we put here this so 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.490
 connect 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 so we take in this case I take the mouse 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.540
 we have here a wireless mouse in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.310
 market we put the sensor here and if my 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.590
 beloved camera operator allows it 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.090
 If you approach the image you will see that when 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.640
 a new the mouse there is a cursor over 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.120
 of the screen you see 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.580
 if we look here we have a mouse but 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.890
 if we go a little further if I take a 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.409
 keyboard this keyboard is here too 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.170
 you have your usb device we put it here 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.570
 we connect it and can also do what 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.960
 same lame I'm going to a mail message 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.180
 electronic I select and here and keyboard 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.150
 let's see now and as I write 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.250
 we get the reproduction of the text for 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.470
 what is the use of this, for example when 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.660
 we pick up the phone and we use 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.730
 extensive of the capabilities that it has 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.160
 to connect to a television we can 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.590
 use the mobile along with a keyboard and 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 a mouse to navigate through 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.570
 our TV and use it as if it were 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 a computer because to navigate to 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.019
 write emails the devices 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 today's mobile phones have more than 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.970
 enough power this is a solution 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.459
 fast that does not require connectivity 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.430
 complex I insist that we can even 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.910
 connect the two if I take these two here 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.890
 I put one here and the other here when I 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.150
 I connect to the mobile in this case this cable 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.890
 it would be very operative for 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.870
 devices with android 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 and already automatically here I would have for a 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.230
 side would have the mouse and on the other hand 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.840
 I have the keyboard or at the same time 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.720
 time I'm writing with the two there 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.310
 more complex solutions that are 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.310
 applied to devices such as 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.250
 iphones or even to the ipad that also 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.320
 allows to use them with keyboards and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.700
 mice as well with devices 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.130
 bluetooth like this keyboard that is 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.500
 here we synchronize the device by the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.700
 bluetooth mobile device and 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.560
 we are automatically in 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.810
 willingness to rewrite I have 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.760
 taken the little freedom of in this 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.430
 Android device on this mobile 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.560
 Android also do the same task I 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.560
 to erase what we have on screen and 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.630
 synchronizing the keyboard this one of apel 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.980
 so magical and so beautiful that just a few 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.100
 things the truth that recognize that they are 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.690
 chuli if more to see this we delete here and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.120
 here you can see how when I'm 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.900
 deleting with the on-screen key 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.900
 it is also erasing 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.370
 and we see how it is erasing for 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.660
 writing does not have to be a keyboard 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.850
 apple bluetooth I also have here a 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.230
 bluetooth keyboard of that 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.550
 in general, any device is worth 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.500
 bluetooth on the market what 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.180
 synchronize and that's it and for that we 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.910
 we go to what we always do menu 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.440
 Bluetooth settings search device 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.060
 we enter the code if it is that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.340
 need and from there we can already 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.530
 keep writing and doing things and now 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.730
 we have a computer that is not a 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.740
 computer but with its own device 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.020
 very useful for us to write to send 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.750
 emails with ease who without 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.890
 have to have a complete computer 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.260
 Well I hope you have found it useful 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.020
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.490
 we will follow later with more things 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.490
 interesting thank you very much
