let's say somewhere between one and
three<00:01:50.610> inches<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.690> heat

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
three inches you don't want some heat

scene<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.680> working<00:01:58.950> about<00:02:01.190> almost

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
scene and here I'm working about almost

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.760 
scene and here I'm working about almost
two<00:02:02.430> cups<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.910> beans<00:02:03.150> green<00:02:03.870> beans<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.530> will

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
two cups of beans green beans which will

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.180 
two cups of beans green beans which will
expand<00:02:05.220> when<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:07.020> roasting<00:02:07.380> was<00:02:07.530> done<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
expand when the roasting was done to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.790 
expand when the roasting was done to
about<00:02:11.120> 50%<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.380> maybe<00:02:13.530> three

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
about 50% more than that so maybe three

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.890 
about 50% more than that so maybe three
cups<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.960> after<00:02:16.320> about<00:02:16.350> five<00:02:16.860> minutes<00:02:16.890> of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
cups this is after about five minutes of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
cups this is after about five minutes of
roasting<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.320> position<00:02:19.890> set<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.580> medium

time<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.040> maybe<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.120> in

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
time you can see maybe you can see in

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
that comes off of the end okay it's now

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.680 
that comes off of the end okay it's now
been<00:03:48.770> seven<00:03:49.250> minutes<00:03:49.670> since<00:03:50.090> we<00:03:50.270> started<00:03:50.510> the

been seven minutes since we started the
process<00:03:50.900> is<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> chief<00:03:51.680> perhaps<00:03:52.580> if<00:03:52.820> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
process is the chief perhaps if the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.310 
process is the chief perhaps if the
beans<00:03:53.150> are<00:03:53.420> getting<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:54.400> brown<00:03:55.400> tinge<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.940> them

there's<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.410> little<00:03:57.620> more<00:03:57.770> chaff<00:03:58.330> coming<00:03:59.330> off

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
there's a little more chaff coming off

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.199 
there's a little more chaff coming off
of<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.690> bean<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:01.370> natural<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:01.910> will

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
of the bean it's natural that will

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.240 
of the bean it's natural that will
happen<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.510> fit<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.900> China<00:04:03.110> coffee<00:04:03.380> bean

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
about half rose resistant you can see

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.940 
about half rose resistant you can see
the<00:04:22.049> beans<00:04:22.290> are<00:04:22.620> moving<00:04:23.010> rather<00:04:23.760> quickly

the beans are moving rather quickly

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.410 
the beans are moving rather quickly
which<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.100> important<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.970> really<00:04:27.120> want<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
which is important you really want to

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.200 
which is important you really want to
get<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.570> nice<00:04:27.720> even<00:04:28.080> wrote<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:29.640> not<00:04:30.150> have

to your prime is lucky momentary and so

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.340 
to your prime is lucky momentary and so
whooping<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.510> beans<00:04:39.690> moving<00:04:40.170> is<00:04:40.320> really

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
whooping the beans moving is really

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.980 
whooping the beans moving is really
important<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.490> platform<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.780> don't

ten<00:04:50.460> minutes<00:04:50.670> you<00:04:51.060> can<00:04:51.210> see<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.450> beans<00:04:51.630> are<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
ten minutes you can see the beans are a

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.440 
ten minutes you can see the beans are a
little<00:04:52.170> bit<00:04:52.290> better<00:04:52.470> service<00:04:52.920> there's<00:04:53.760> it's

little bit better service there's it's

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.100 
little bit better service there's it's

these<00:07:39.000> beans<00:07:39.240> are<00:07:39.450> awfully<00:07:40.020> hot<00:07:40.560> you<00:07:41.130> have<00:07:41.250> to

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
these beans are awfully hot you have to

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.010 
these beans are awfully hot you have to
get<00:07:41.460> them<00:07:41.550> up<00:07:41.640> to<00:07:41.670> about<00:07:41.760> 500<00:07:42.150> degrees<00:07:42.450> to<00:07:42.900> get

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 
get them up to about 500 degrees to get

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.690 
get them up to about 500 degrees to get
them<00:07:43.110> roasted<00:07:43.530> but<00:07:44.100> you<00:07:44.160> don't<00:07:44.310> dare<00:07:44.460> get<00:07:44.610> them

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:44.700 
them roasted but you don't dare get them

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.070 
them roasted but you don't dare get them
up<00:07:44.820> there<00:07:44.940> too<00:07:45.120> quickly<00:07:45.390> because<00:07:45.690> otherwise

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 
up there too quickly because otherwise

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.560 
up there too quickly because otherwise
you'll<00:07:46.500> end<00:07:46.560> up<00:07:46.680> with<00:07:46.830> an<00:07:46.950> uneven<00:07:47.250> rose<00:07:47.610> which

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:48.570 
you'll end up with an uneven rose which

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.490 
you'll end up with an uneven rose which
is<00:07:48.600> not<00:07:48.870> what<00:07:49.050> you<00:07:49.140> want<00:07:49.380> so<00:07:51.170> that<00:07:52.170> is

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 
is not what you want so that is

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.830 
is not what you want so that is
essentially<00:07:53.100> it<00:07:53.370> now<00:07:53.610> it's<00:07:53.760> me<00:07:54.210> waiting<00:07:54.660> to

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 
essentially it now it's me waiting to

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.400 
essentially it now it's me waiting to
lie<00:07:55.400> to<00:07:56.400> the<00:07:56.520> beans<00:07:56.700> pulak<00:07:57.210> which<00:07:57.510> takes<00:07:57.780> 10

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.410 
lie to the beans pulak which takes 10

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:08.570 
lie to the beans pulak which takes 10
minutes<00:07:58.650> maybe<00:08:05.150> that's<00:08:06.150> good
