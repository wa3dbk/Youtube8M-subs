00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.510 
things first off I bought this miracle
whisk<00:00:17.000> from<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> vendor<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.920> what<00:00:19.920> sold<00:00:20.310> me<00:00:20.400> on

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
whisk from a vendor and what sold me on

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.730 
whisk from a vendor and what sold me on
it<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.980> good<00:00:23.369> whisk<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
it was that it is a good whisk and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
it was that it is a good whisk and
basically<00:00:25.740> what<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.340> sum<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
basically what you do is just sum up and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.500 
basically what you do is just sum up and
down<00:00:27.720> motions<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.250> rotates<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.179> air

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
down motions and it rotates and air

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.319 
down motions and it rotates and air
rates<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.320> mixes<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.610> I'll<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.300> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
went to the State Fair and I didn't buy

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
went to the State Fair and I didn't buy
it<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.640> I've<00:01:29.729> been<00:01:29.880> regretting<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it and I've been regretting it for a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
it and I've been regretting it for a
long<00:01:31.350> time<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.430> when<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> went

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
long time and so this time when I went

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
long time and so this time when I went
there<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> made<00:01:33.240> sure<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.810> saw<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
there and made sure that if I saw I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.039 
there and made sure that if I saw I
would<00:01:35.340> buy<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.820> I'll<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> open<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
would buy and I'll have to open it and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.490 
would buy and I'll have to open it and
do<00:01:37.829> another<00:01:38.040> demo<00:01:38.369> video<00:01:38.720> again<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:39.990> it's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
do another demo video again but it's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.940 
do another demo video again but it's
actually<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:41.159> cool<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.380> also<00:01:43.560> came

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
actually really cool and it also came

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.520 
actually really cool and it also came
with<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.460> chef's<00:01:44.880> knife<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
with this chef's knife and I think it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.999 
with this chef's knife and I think it
retailed<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.369> 30<00:01:47.790> bucks<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.619> since<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
retailed for like 30 bucks but since the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.630 
retailed for like 30 bucks but since the
guy<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.310> doing<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.579> show<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.409> about

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
guy was doing a show I got it for about

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.179 
guy was doing a show I got it for about
twenty-five<00:01:53.640> dollars<00:01:54.530> then<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> also<00:01:55.829> went<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
twenty-five dollars then I also went to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.359 
twenty-five dollars then I also went to
this<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.549> booth<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.299> sold<00:01:57.600> these<00:01:57.780> um

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
this other booth that sold these um

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.370
