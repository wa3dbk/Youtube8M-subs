00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 then let's see what awaits us instead 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.880
 in 2014 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.610
 very important appointment in the first one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.419
 semester European championships are known instead 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.120
 that the gentleman knows sofia in this case 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.930
 what do we expect the junior we have 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.670
 certainly a bit of difficulty because 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.070
 99 2000 these two years are 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 those that can participate in these 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 European junior championships 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 we are a little bit in trouble from the point 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 of quantitative and also view 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.630
 qualitative so we will have a little bit 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.000
 clench the teeth 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.890
 we definitely have two at the moment 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.090
 gymnasts we can consider of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.190
 tip that are pilar rubagotti emerged 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.379
 both fiab used from 2000 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.040
 then we have five other girls 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.040
 they will have to conquer the places we remember 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.659
 the formula in this case will be 553 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.990
 because the 99 can compete and the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.820
 best 99 will get if falling under some 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 parameters the qualification for the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.020
 yachts that will be in china in the month of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.579
 August at senior level 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.119
 we finally have a drawing group not 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.829
 I say fed but I'm pretty 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.700
 enough to create a minimum 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.219
 of internal competition in order to 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.350
 create a spirit of growth 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.569
 important and of sporting competition 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.439
 how right it is for there to be 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:54.530
 be chosen in the second part of the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.350
 season obviously apart from yog vi 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.509
 will be the world championships too 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.819
 in china and that its start 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.619
 also qualifying world championships 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.110
 if in this case I don't think it's a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.030
 big problem for Italy return 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.649
 among the top twenty-four teams per 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.410
 world while on the other hand 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.150
 still the junior category we will have i 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.700
 Mediterranean junior games that you 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.829
 they will keep in ragusa where they will have to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 join a couple of gymnasts for 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:25.810
 nation is clear what is expected 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.370
 from these competitions 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.629
 today, as we have hoped today 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.740
 first of all to have all the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.050
 gymnasts 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.700
 in shape and if vanessa ferrari and will keep 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.080
 what he showed in this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.240
 a glimpse of the season 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.420
 still preparing I think for the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.850
 Europeans can truly be one 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.910
 gymnast to keep an eye on both in 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.710
 general competition from both the beam and the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.870
 free body 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.940
 as for the others now 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.410
 let's see how they will continue in this 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.570
 moment they are all trying to 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.400
 increase a little bit what it is 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.470
 the note of why obviously the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.270
 international comparison goes 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.180
 always higher and therefore important 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.460
 have higher notes of course 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.070
 without losing in as far as 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.360
 regards the executive note for 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.210
 regarding the new championships of 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.800
 world at the moment we say the only true one 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.990
 arrow to aim the medal is still 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.030
 But she still vanessa this we 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.070
 in the second part of the year 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.390
 we will see him with a little calm 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.970
 also how it will go into preparation 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.280
 summer and how the conditions will be 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.800
 of athletes because we have different 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.260
 lawyers athletes 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.500
 besides we have said in 95 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.990
 we have bell and gandolfi for 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.760
 as for 96 we have fazana le 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.000
 to return after a long period and de 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.170
 agostini in 97 we have meneghini e 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.440
 leolini and as for 98 we have 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.940
 large group of gymnasts who are 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.670
 green mori rizzelli marongiu morera 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.620
 bonistalli interlenghi I mentioned this 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.590
 in hand that others obviously can't 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.410
 insert clearly if someone does 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.210
 wants to insert in this context will have to 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.070
 prove it through competitions or 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.060
 through tests also 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.890
 they can do 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.299
 It is clear that confronting these 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.299
 athletes will not be easy for anyone
