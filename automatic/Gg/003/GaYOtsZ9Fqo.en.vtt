 dear boys and girls dear 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.500
 parents welcome to my channel in 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.710
 this video I'm going to test 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.380
 set mister zubastik here this 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.539
 mister zubastik 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.539
 poor man has no teeth at all 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.980
 we begin with the fact that we have these teeth 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:37.870
 let's do before that there is a whole big 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:40.290
 can of white plasticine compared to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.140
 usual standard jar plateau she 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.140
 more than 2 times in volume 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.750
 teeth formula is formed using here 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.750
 of this platform 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:38.290
 the first tooth is ready for everything he fits 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.050
 in the jaw of 16 teeth and now I first 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:46.560
 I will quickly do it and then turn it on again 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.509
 the camera here is our teeth ready as you can see 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.400
 not all men are alright he has 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.830
 caries 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.100
 but before i fly it i 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.619
 brush my teeth with a red toothbrush 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.789
 pasta and of course it is not fasting 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.789
 plasticine and from a small jar 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 what to do with the wheel that tooth which 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.519
 rotted out completely we will tear out with the help 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.409
 tweezers by the way black plasticine to 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.909
 Unfortunately, there was not only a set 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.950
 gray red gray and white 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.079
 but it seemed to me that with gray will not 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:42.890
 convincingly enough and I have a chance 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:45.349
 stayed black and i added it alone 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.220
 the tooth had to be removed completely in 2 y 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.500
 we are not yet a big black hole 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.500
 and so we have her with a drill 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 will remove 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:18.390
 you can't just leave a hole 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:20.930
 make a swim before i have a gray 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.930
 plasticine 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.960
 what I forgot to show at the beginning is that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.390
 he has this on his neck 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.870
 such a pocket 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:04:03.290
 there you can put red clay 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:06.410
 what do you think why but why 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.170
 it was necessary to do the language itself 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.420
 early on when I still didn't set my teeth and 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.610
 Now to make it to me 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.610
 I had to pull out my upper teeth 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.850
 put them back 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:02.689
 one more to rice us stayed this we too 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.689
 quick fix 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:04.710
 all the teeth are now healthy but 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:09.040
 they are very crooked and also fall out 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:12.100
 look therefore to help him 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.920
 you will need to make braces and that we 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:20.110
 let's do the next video if you 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.360
 interestingly look at it, too, as well 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.450
