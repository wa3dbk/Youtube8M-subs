00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello, I'm good to see a user of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.950
 youtube in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.950
 teach how to save games in 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.009
 the nintendo emulator 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:25.940
 there are other tutorials where they put like 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.370
 download emulators games of all 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.380
 well this is the folder where I have 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.450
 the emulator where the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.450
 games games 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.430
 only with downloading the emulator and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.670
 the emulator and you do it all 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 folders 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.000
 I'll show you how they are saved 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.170
 the games 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.170
 we open the emulator 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.990
 I'm going to open a recent game 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.310
 a game that I had here already 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.060
 we do not select the game 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.850
 the game the battle city I do not know if the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.590
 Havana 6 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.300
 this time already of this game that what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.460
 they took out in the old consoles 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.330
 this is very old-fashioned but still 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.330
 it's still there 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.229
 well this is this is the game 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.150
 well then how are the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.069
 The items are saved by the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.749
 you keep them as you leave them 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.849
 so if you leave a game in 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.590
 pause for example you're going to stay in 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.569
 pause when the load is another in the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.939
 starting again 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.050
 then the game can save from 1 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.330
 to 9 and 0 to 10 games you can save 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.030
 clicking the upper numbers of the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:36.820
 keyboard letters you can save in the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.820
 number 1 the 2 3 4 5 the 6 7 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.730
 to 0 that is to say 10 parties like those of 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.730
 home from said previously 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.450
 so if we save the game we are 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.690
 it will be like the gray color that the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.690
 zero 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.880
 and to save the game we press the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.420
 number 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.710
 this time I'm going to keep it at number 1 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.710
 we make the number and f5 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.420
 I will not put you are at number 1 and 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.220
 guarded 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.700
 so if now we want to go back to the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.700
 departure 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.190
 we were playing 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.510
 again in the games again so that 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.110
 you see that it is not a 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.890
 a slow or something without weird that is that 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.890
 save the game 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.650
 bad we start another game again 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.100
 we go back to number 1 and to load the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.000
 green speak c5 which is to save you 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.750
 we give 17 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.160
 and the game is opened directly 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.520
 ok this is all thanks for visiting
