and distract your attention from the
rabbits<00:02:53.540> which<00:02:54.049> is<00:02:54.200> what<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.440> show<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.620> all

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
rabbits which is what the show is all

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.280 
rabbits which is what the show is all
about<00:02:55.269> I've<00:02:56.269> heard<00:02:56.330> some<00:02:56.600> slightly<00:02:56.840> negative
