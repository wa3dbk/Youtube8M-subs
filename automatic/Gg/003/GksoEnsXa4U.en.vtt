 hello marc for guardian's universe 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.570
 for one like your online store 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.210
 goalkeepers 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.139
 today we present you the glove and 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.200
 rim to contact ultra grip 2.0 this is a 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.640
 glove mid-range of the brand and rim 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.040
 at erie marked a brand anyway 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.040
 specialist of collective sport in particular 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.829
 football that has a range of banks there is 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.009
 relatively correct so that's why 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.110
 that the guardian's universe the reference 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:37.310
 so we're on a latex glove 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:41.570
 supersoft 3.5 mm latex on the back of the 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:45.800
 glove one is on a glove with seams 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.310
 holtzinger so in cow's udder with the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:56.350
 relatively enlarged fingertips for 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.350
 a better contact we will try it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:10.399
 so who owns the dead system for 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:15.500
 return the glove closing with a double 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:19.000
 scratch you have latex areas of 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.049
 two locks waterproof forgiveness between 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 every finger the halfinger seams 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.189
 so the glove size relatively small 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.560
 no no no I of the new CDU nine 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.149
 and a half and I 'm still a little tight 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.490
 so we should still consider 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.990
 a half size bigger or even 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.670
 size if you like to be dropped 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 in the glove if it is good to be tight 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.190
 you just take a half size that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.229
 should go the glove and customizable 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.959
 we are on a cut a cut 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.069
 ergonomic so fingers slightly 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:55.250
 discarded and the natural position of the 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.560
 hand the correct thesis for a wind 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.890
 important around 60 euros 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.179
 it's not bad here it was mark for 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.179
