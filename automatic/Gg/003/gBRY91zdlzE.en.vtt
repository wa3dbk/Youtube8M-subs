00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
turn this on you can hear this thing but

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.350 
turn this on you can hear this thing but
up<00:01:50.500> now<00:01:50.890> obviously<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.520> screen<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:52.180> is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
up now obviously the screen for this is

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.840 
up now obviously the screen for this is
going<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.570> look<00:01:52.690> pretty<00:01:52.750> terrible<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:54.340> camera

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
going to look pretty terrible on camera

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.640 
going to look pretty terrible on camera
because<00:01:54.970> it's<00:01:55.510> obviously<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> old<00:01:56.260> style

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
because it's obviously the old style

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.070 
because it's obviously the old style
sort<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.160> CRT<00:01:57.730> screen<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.780> it's<00:01:58.930> going<00:01:59.020> to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
sort of CRT screen so it's going to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.850 
sort of CRT screen so it's going to
flash<00:01:59.700> ahead<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.880> lot<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.320> unfortunately

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
flash ahead of a lot so unfortunately

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.040 
flash ahead of a lot so unfortunately
we're<00:02:03.040> not<00:02:03.070> going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.370> have<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.550> see<00:02:03.960> very<00:02:04.960> well

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
we're not going to have to see very well

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.960 
we're not going to have to see very well
with<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.500> he<00:02:05.800> keeps<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.250> focus<00:02:06.550> as

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
with that he keeps going to focus as

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.160 
with that he keeps going to focus as
well<00:02:08.130> but<00:02:09.130> whilst<00:02:09.640> that's<00:02:09.940> turning<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.450> let's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
well but whilst that's turning on let's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.320 
well but whilst that's turning on let's
just<00:02:11.260> turn<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.709> around<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.430> I'll<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.120> show

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
just turn this around and I'll just show

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.060 
just turn this around and I'll just show
you<00:02:13.360> guys<00:02:13.720> who<00:02:14.290> haven't<00:02:14.500> seen<00:02:14.770> one<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.920> these

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
you guys who haven't seen one of these

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.620 
you guys who haven't seen one of these
before<00:02:15.130> some<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.790> ports<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> way<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
before some of the ports and the way it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.540 
before some of the ports and the way it
was<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:16.870> connected<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.280> see<00:02:18.430> you've

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
was all connected so you can see you've

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.790 
was all connected so you can see you've
got<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.760> Ethernet<00:02:19.150> port<00:02:19.180> there<00:02:19.720> you've<00:02:20.650> got

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.870 
got the Ethernet port there you've got
two<00:02:21.010> firewire<00:02:21.400> ports<00:02:22.180> two<00:02:23.170> USB<00:02:23.200> ports<00:02:23.739> an<00:02:24.430> old

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
two firewire ports two USB ports an old

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.550 
two firewire ports two USB ports an old
modem<00:02:25.180> port<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:26.170> then<00:02:26.290> we've<00:02:26.380> got<00:02:26.410> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
modem port and then we've got a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.190 
modem port and then we've got a
microphone<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> also<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> speaker<00:02:28.480> port<00:02:28.720> along

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
microphone and also a speaker port along

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.530 
microphone and also a speaker port along
with<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.440> couple<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.770> buttons<00:02:29.950> as<00:02:30.280> well<00:02:30.540> and

with a couple of buttons as well and
then<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> back<00:02:32.020> we've<00:02:32.560> got<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.830> actual

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
then on the back we've got the actual

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.190 
then on the back we've got the actual
power<00:02:33.310> cable<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:33.910> kind<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.330> slots<00:02:34.690> nicely

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
can see there's the kind of log on

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.840 
can see there's the kind of log on
screen<00:02:43.239> there<00:02:44.370> now<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.300> actually<00:02:46.510> a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
screen there now this one is actually a

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.449 
screen there now this one is actually a
500<00:02:48.850> megahertz<00:02:49.260> processor<00:02:50.459> powerpc

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
500 megahertz processor powerpc

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.310 
500 megahertz processor powerpc
obviously<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.959> got<00:02:53.220> 768<00:02:54.220> mix<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.760> RAM<00:02:55.320> it's

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
obviously it's got 768 mix of RAM it's
