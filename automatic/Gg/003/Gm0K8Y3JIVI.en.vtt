00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
numbers so I'm using numbers at version

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.620 
numbers so I'm using numbers at version
3<00:00:11.010> I'm<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> show<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.759> interactive

3 I'm going to show you interactive

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.440 
3 I'm going to show you interactive
charts<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.130> know<00:00:14.519> regular<00:00:14.730> charts<00:00:15.269> are

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
charts so you know regular charts are

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
charts so you know regular charts are
just<00:00:15.960> static<00:00:16.529> graphics<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.980> appear<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
just static graphics that appear on the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.279 
just static graphics that appear on the
screen<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.270> animate<00:00:18.660> them<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.109> them

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
screen you can animate them to have them

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.500 
screen you can animate them to have them
grow<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.220> instance<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.609> could<00:00:20.730> select

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
grow like for instance we could select

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.269 
grow like for instance we could select
this<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.470> could<00:00:22.560> say<00:00:22.769> create<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
this one here and we could say create a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
this one here and we could say create a
chart<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> 2d<00:00:24.750> chart<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.260> there<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> go

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
chart like a 2d chart and there we go

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.370 
chart like a 2d chart and there we go
we've<00:00:25.800> got<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.789> data<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.140> one

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
we've got all the data from that in one

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.009 
we've got all the data from that in one
big<00:00:28.650> chart<00:00:29.119> but<00:00:30.119> sometimes<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.810> data

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
big chart but sometimes you have data

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.389 
big chart but sometimes you have data
like<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.500> where<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.949> want<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.279> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
like this where you want to make it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.400 
like this where you want to make it
interactive<00:00:32.750> because<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.110> more<00:00:34.350> than

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
interactive because you have more than

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.560 
interactive because you have more than
one<00:00:34.649> dimension<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.700> we've<00:00:35.850> got<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
one dimension here we've got say the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you can have slider and buttons or just

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
you can have slider and buttons or just
buttons<00:01:49.020> only<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.040> use<00:01:50.759> these

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
buttons only so you can just use these

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
buttons only so you can just use these
right<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:51.479> makes<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.810> sense<00:01:52.079> if

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
right here which makes more sense if

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
right here which makes more sense if
you're<00:01:52.350> talking<00:01:52.500> about<00:01:52.649> three<00:01:53.189> years<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you're talking about three years and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
you're talking about three years and
there<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.540> four<00:01:54.869> different<00:01:55.229> styles<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there are four different styles of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.060 
there are four different styles of
interactive<00:01:56.430> chart<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.969> saw<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.540> when<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
interactive chart you saw there when I

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.410 
interactive chart you saw there when I
created<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> chart<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.460> had<00:01:59.579> four<00:01:59.820> choices<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
created the chart I had four choices I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
created the chart I had four choices I
could<00:02:00.810> change<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.469> here<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> an

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
could change them here so I can go to an

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.319 
could change them here so I can go to an
interactive<00:02:03.920> bar<00:02:04.920> instead<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.399> column<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
interactive bar instead of column just a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.529 
interactive bar instead of column just a
few<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.719> way<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> scatter<00:02:08.539> which

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
few it that way I can do a scatter which

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.400 
few it that way I can do a scatter which
doesn't<00:02:10.170> make<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.379> much<00:02:10.410> sense<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.160> this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
doesn't make as much sense for this

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.710 
doesn't make as much sense for this
and<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.770> can<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.310> bubble<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.300> well<00:02:15.510> which

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and I can do a bubble as well which

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.820 
and I can do a bubble as well which
again<00:02:15.840> doesn't<00:02:16.170> make<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.350> much<00:02:16.440> sense<00:02:16.500> for

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
again doesn't make as much sense for

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.380 
again doesn't make as much sense for
this<00:02:16.950> particular<00:02:17.190> set<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.550> data<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.270> it's

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this particular set of data but it's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.600 
this particular set of data but it's
good<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.540> know<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.460> big

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
good to know it's here now the big

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.130 
good to know it's here now the big
downside<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.120> nature<00:02:21.450> chart<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.080> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
downside to nature chart is when you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.420 
downside to nature chart is when you
export<00:02:22.500> them<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.770> something<00:02:23.010> else<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.310> say

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
export them is something else like say

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.250 
export them is something else like say
PDF<00:02:23.910> they're<00:02:24.450> not<00:02:24.570> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.810> interactive

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
PDF they're not going to be interactive

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.780 
PDF they're not going to be interactive
anymore<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> use<00:02:26.520> them<00:02:26.610> inside

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
anymore so you have to use them inside

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.070 
anymore so you have to use them inside
of<00:02:26.910> numbers<00:02:27.210> but<00:02:27.420> since<00:02:27.630> numbers<00:02:27.930> is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
of numbers but since numbers is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.710 
of numbers but since numbers is
available<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.500> iOS<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.100> Mac<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:30.420> PC

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
available in iOS and Mac and for PC

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.360 
available in iOS and Mac and for PC
users<00:02:30.870> via<00:02:31.400> numbers<00:02:32.450> iCloud<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:35.130> becomes

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
users via numbers iCloud then it becomes

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.070 
users via numbers iCloud then it becomes
a<00:02:35.400> little<00:02:35.490> more<00:02:35.610> useful<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.660> general<00:02:36.960> it's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
a little more useful but in general it's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.020 
a little more useful but in general it's
just<00:02:37.110> kind<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.500> useful<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.850> be

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
just kind of useful for you just to be

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.670 
just kind of useful for you just to be
able<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.210> see<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.570> change<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.440> able<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
able to see the change or be able to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.500 
able to see the change or be able to
show<00:02:41.010> somebody<00:02:41.220> during<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:42.120> presentation

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
show somebody during a presentation

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.260 
show somebody during a presentation
where<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.020> bring<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.350> numbers<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.270> walk

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
where you can bring up numbers and walk

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.930 
where you can bring up numbers and walk
them<00:02:45.420> through<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.630> chart
