00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.050
 it has more than on the console for the mediator in the order because it 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.420
 incarnates 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 bmw sauber 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.770
 a little more fear than harm in the past 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.950
 with that fire 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 the choir 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.560
 so after the fears be on vacation that your rival always bf 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.100
 was stolen a sports almanac in the fire on them for plate in the soul 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.170
 of the recovery 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 this sporty almanac the fahva became the richest man and the most 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.640
 more in the world thanks to these sports betting pro cheats 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.020
 so she as you are you decided to travel from a land to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.220
 go get this almanac it is destroyed and there all forever 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.440
 times where he's a little risky like this bull but imagine a comet the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.929
 results of the examinations are more 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.299
 imagine that Italy could only dream 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.799
 franz embody the characters me who will work or appliances 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.409
 a world well enough thank you 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.849
 for him the fed I must say that they are really distraught and it is in the 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.479
 country I saw 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.649
 the music as banal and boring and adds the class of ce2 to this game of 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:32.799
 rotten games 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.260
 messece game and accompany him to Algiers one or two years that one must not 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.789
 expect a lot from them 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.349
 for the purpose of the game I receive a confidence 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.930
 I took advantage of what you do all I want is walk me 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.079
 in this kind of world yesterday but I really do not know where to go 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.739
 if I knew it I had told you will probably be a detail but I 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.650
 have no idea and I have never managed to pass the first 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.269
 level if at least there were levels in the game I do not even know 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.139
 all I noticed is that you can pick up objects such as 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.059
 capsule parts atomic symbols and ethics never port m to 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.959
 daegu what will it stop there for the keys that will open up 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.309
 doors that lead nowhere 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.189
 as you can see I managed to find the remote 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.109
 stellarium that can allow you to travel back in time a ticket on them 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.239
 it was belhassen from choisey the time in which you want to go but that 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.449
 would be nice of her dress and the cami ali kassem made it very mixed and I 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.449
 can you know I never have anything to do it's the adq 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.879
 this I would probably have at all different contracts sailing boats this 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.290
 would still be a genevois no liter between the stage and the game 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.259
 the life choice you have to beat crushing and the mischievous like 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.029
 species of all 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:47.979
 tortoise 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.269
 and either 0 who are spinning everywhere to help a model who walks saints 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.659
 who jumps everywhere 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.739
 snails from neighborhoods and snails disorders 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.009
 Why 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.009
 a beer bock 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.069
 I wish I could obama and aso 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.840
 with the few references to movies with skateboard and dice 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.599
 during men 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.199
 this game the madonna mallorca despite the rain that took possession of less this 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.139
 that you have that I've tried slow enough to have enough money instead of 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.790
 the margin but never succeeded 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.210
 the people signed accounts was going to finish I silence it would be 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.400
 funny end tells the pr 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 I broke you a nice dps gift that I played in my life can be 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.569
 a start of play just short obama 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.139
 josÃ© crushed blue weapons and gas pitchers it's not really my 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.409
 thing 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.110
 you can always try the game that's for sure but in my opinion you 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.349
 will share the same opinion as me about the fact that this game that is really 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:48.749
 rotten 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.749
 to conclude 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
 in Wales 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.529
 finally the head of the epad 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.279
 he prefers to be silent 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.990
 more than ever 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.919
 the gust is sometimes difficult to talk about her 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:11.539
