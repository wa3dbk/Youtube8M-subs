00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
complicated but in the end like I said

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.450 
complicated but in the end like I said
take<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.870> best<00:03:11.170> people<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.310> tip

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
take the best people so that is tip

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.420 
take the best people so that is tip
number<00:03:12.520> two<00:03:13.410> okay<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.470> tip<00:03:14.710> number<00:03:14.740> three<00:03:15.280> this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
number two okay so tip number three this

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.160 
number two okay so tip number three this
is<00:03:15.490> another<00:03:16.060> way<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.300> get<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> little<00:03:16.870> bit<00:03:17.050> more

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
is another way to get a little bit more

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.979 
is another way to get a little bit more
money<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.490> map<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.270> during<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> game

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
money so on your map and during the game

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.840 
money so on your map and during the game
you'll<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.440> these<00:03:20.709> random<00:03:21.130> events<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.790> I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
you'll have these random events and I

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.550 
you'll have these random events and I
think<00:03:22.120> they're<00:03:22.300> like<00:03:22.480> blue<00:03:22.810> dots<00:03:23.110> on<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.530> map

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
think they're like blue dots on the map

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.699 
think they're like blue dots on the map
and<00:03:23.980> what<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.360> usually<00:03:26.140> means<00:03:26.320> some

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
and what that is it usually means some

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.380 
and what that is it usually means some
pedestrian<00:03:27.430> needs<00:03:27.730> help<00:03:27.970> either<00:03:28.209> with<00:03:28.360> a
