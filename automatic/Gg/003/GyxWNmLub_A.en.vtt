00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
I used it I almost use like half the jar

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.820 
I used it I almost use like half the jar
on<00:02:21.459> my<00:02:21.610> hair<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.209> then<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.840> didn't<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.770> wasn't

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
like my hair was like covered in jello

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
like my hair was like covered in jello
or<00:02:25.780> something<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.260> by<00:02:26.500> these<00:02:26.770> eco<00:02:27.130> styler

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
or something like it by these eco styler

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.900 
or something like it by these eco styler
it<00:02:27.819> was<00:02:28.360> um<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.170> glycerin<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.190> first<00:02:30.760> of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
it was um the glycerin in it first of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.530

it just there wasn't a lot of pumping in
it<00:03:04.660> was<00:03:04.989> just<00:03:05.170> kind<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.739> glycerin<00:03:06.220> and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.830 
it was just kind of like glycerin and
water<00:03:06.519> pretty<00:03:06.819> much<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.269> that's<00:03:07.510> how<00:03:07.660> it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
water pretty much like that's how it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.420 
water pretty much like that's how it
felt<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.980> um<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:10.830> didn't<00:03:11.830> really<00:03:11.920> like<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.190> like

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430

kind<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.680> wanted<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.010> smooth<00:04:09.340> my<00:04:09.640> hair<00:04:09.670> down

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
kind of wanted to smooth my hair down

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.720 
kind of wanted to smooth my hair down
and<00:04:10.600> like<00:04:10.750> wet<00:04:11.170> it's<00:04:11.350> um<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:12.130> instead<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.489> use

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
and like wet it's um so instead of use

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.250 
and like wet it's um so instead of use
water<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.450> put<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.250> soft<00:04:15.250> gel<00:04:15.519> over<00:04:16.120> top<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
water I put the soft gel over top of the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.349 
water I put the soft gel over top of the
honey<00:04:17.590> butter<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.459> then<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.820> wet<00:04:18.970> my<00:04:19.120> hair

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
honey butter so then it wet my hair

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.090 
honey butter so then it wet my hair
because<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.870> knew<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.470> was<00:04:20.680> like<00:04:20.919> the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
because I knew that that was like the

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.490 
because I knew that that was like the
reaction<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.880> get<00:04:21.940> with<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.390> gel<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.350> now<00:04:23.470> I

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
reaction I get with this gel so now I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.750 
reaction I get with this gel so now I
just<00:04:23.740> twisted<00:04:23.950> it

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
just twisted it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.730 
just twisted it
after<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.720> did<00:04:25.900> work<00:04:25.930> really<00:04:26.410> well

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
after that so it did work really well

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.880 
after that so it did work really well
for<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:27.310> purpose<00:04:27.760> i<00:04:28.060> buy<00:04:28.780> well<00:04:29.680> I'm<00:04:29.770> not

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
for that purpose i buy well I'm not

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.710 
for that purpose i buy well I'm not
going<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.250> buy<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.430> gel<00:04:30.790> again<00:04:31.030> but<00:04:31.360> if<00:04:31.570> I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
going to buy this gel again but if I

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.800 
going to buy this gel again but if I
were<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.290> come<00:04:33.100> across<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:33.940> if<00:04:34.510> we<00:04:34.690> were<00:04:34.780> to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
were to come across it and if we were to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.890 
were to come across it and if we were to
cross<00:04:35.140> paths<00:04:35.710> again<00:04:36.100> that's<00:04:37.030> definitely<00:04:37.540> how

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
cross paths again that's definitely how

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.020 
cross paths again that's definitely how
I<00:04:37.930> would<00:04:38.350> use<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.710> on<00:04:38.740> more<00:04:39.250> first<00:04:39.490> foots<00:04:39.730> outs

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
I would use it on more first foots outs

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.080 
I would use it on more first foots outs
but<00:04:40.780> um<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.470> ingredients<00:04:42.010> are<00:04:42.130> really<00:04:42.460> good<00:04:42.700> I

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
but um the ingredients are really good I

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.720 
but um the ingredients are really good I
don't<00:04:43.420> think<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.440> terrible<00:04:44.710> gel<00:04:45.220> like<00:04:45.550> I

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
don't think it's a terrible gel like I

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.870 
don't think it's a terrible gel like I
didn't<00:04:46.480> like<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:47.110> didn't<00:04:47.980> do<00:04:48.130> what<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.310> wanted<00:04:48.610> it

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
didn't like I didn't do what I wanted it

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.090 
didn't like I didn't do what I wanted it
to<00:04:49.060> do<00:04:49.240> but<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.810> i<00:04:49.930> said<00:04:49.960> like<00:04:50.560> i<00:04:50.710> really<00:04:50.980> only

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
to do but like i said like i really only

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.900 
to do but like i said like i really only
think<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.580> project<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.210> bad<00:04:52.600> when<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:54.580> like

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
think a project is like bad when it like

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.910 
think a project is like bad when it like
makes<00:04:55.180> my<00:04:55.330> hair<00:04:55.510> dry<00:04:55.720> makes<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.140> tangle<00:04:56.530> blah

makes my hair dry makes a tangle blah

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.680 
makes my hair dry makes a tangle blah
blah<00:04:57.100> blah<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.670> didn't<00:04:57.970> do<00:04:58.030> any<00:04:58.060> of<00:04:58.270> that<00:04:58.360> I

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
blah blah it didn't do any of that I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.440 
blah blah it didn't do any of that I
just<00:04:58.990> didn't<00:04:59.380> um<00:04:59.680> I<00:05:00.130> don't<00:05:01.030> like<00:05:01.300> that

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
just didn't um I don't like that

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.570 
just didn't um I don't like that
glycerin<00:05:01.960> wet<00:05:02.110> thing<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.470> get<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.890> lot<00:05:03.280> and

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
glycerin wet thing I get that a lot and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.970 
glycerin wet thing I get that a lot and
then<00:05:03.760> after<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.510> do<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.810> then<00:05:05.230> my<00:05:05.350> hair<00:05:05.650> takes

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
then after I do that then my hair takes

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.590 
then after I do that then my hair takes
forever<00:05:06.870> forever<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:08.860> dry<00:05:09.010> because<00:05:09.600> glycerin

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
forever forever to dry because glycerin

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.570 
forever forever to dry because glycerin
is<00:05:10.630> already<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.290> humectant<00:05:11.590> very<00:05:12.220> strongly

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
is already a humectant very strongly

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.730 
is already a humectant very strongly
mech<00:05:12.880> tent<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:13.540> if<00:05:13.750> it's<00:05:13.930> pretty<00:05:14.230> damp<00:05:14.500> outside

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
mech tent so if it's pretty damp outside

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.980 
mech tent so if it's pretty damp outside
it<00:05:15.490> already<00:05:15.790> takes<00:05:15.940> long<00:05:16.300> enough<00:05:16.510> for<00:05:16.660> my<00:05:16.750> hair

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
it already takes long enough for my hair

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.960 
it already takes long enough for my hair
to<00:05:17.020> dry<00:05:17.260> on<00:05:17.590> its<00:05:17.650> own<00:05:18.100> because<00:05:18.520> it's<00:05:18.850> low

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
to dry on its own because it's low

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.690 
to dry on its own because it's low
porosity<00:05:19.240> then<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.080> just<00:05:20.290> have<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.680> like<00:05:20.890> 10

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
porosity then I just have that like 10

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.640 
porosity then I just have that like 10
hours<00:05:21.730> later<00:05:22.420> my<00:05:22.990> hair<00:05:23.200> will<00:05:23.350> still<00:05:23.560> be

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
hours later my hair will still be

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.150 
hours later my hair will still be
soaking<00:05:24.040> wet<00:05:24.160> so<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.490> it's<00:05:24.970> not<00:05:25.620> right<00:05:26.620> for<00:05:26.650> my

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
soaking wet so I it's not right for my

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.220 
soaking wet so I it's not right for my
hair<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.490> use<00:05:27.880> for<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.150> wash<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.420> go<00:05:28.720> if<00:05:28.990> you

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
hair to use for a wash and go if you

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.790 
hair to use for a wash and go if you
have<00:05:29.470> higher<00:05:30.400> porosity<00:05:31.090> hair<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:32.170> your<00:05:32.770> hair

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
have higher porosity hair and your hair

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.420 
have higher porosity hair and your hair
dries<00:05:33.190> faster<00:05:33.790> then<00:05:34.060> maybe<00:05:34.390> um<00:05:35.040> that<00:05:36.040> would<00:05:36.250> be

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
dries faster then maybe um that would be

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.980 
dries faster then maybe um that would be
better<00:05:36.640> for<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:38.740> yeah<00:05:39.400> it's<00:05:39.910> alright<00:05:40.630> i

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
better for you but yeah it's alright i

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.740 
better for you but yeah it's alright i
just<00:05:41.710> say<00:05:41.830> provides<00:05:42.220> all<00:05:42.490> sold<00:05:42.760> for<00:05:42.820> twist<00:05:43.240> so

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
just say provides all sold for twist so

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.830 
just say provides all sold for twist so
I<00:05:43.780> think<00:05:43.930> for<00:05:44.140> twist<00:05:44.530> is<00:05:44.710> good<00:05:44.950> but<00:05:45.280> not<00:05:46.000> for<00:05:46.450> a

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
I think for twist is good but not for a

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.360 
I think for twist is good but not for a
washing<00:05:47.170> go<00:05:47.500> um<00:05:49.290> kind<00:05:50.290> of<00:05:50.410> like<00:05:50.650> that's<00:05:51.250> the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
washing go um kind of like that's the

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.430 
washing go um kind of like that's the
same<00:05:51.640> kind<00:05:52.150> of<00:05:52.990> way<00:05:53.110> I<00:05:53.140> felt<00:05:53.440> about<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:54.160> win

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
same kind of way I felt about the win

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.020 
same kind of way I felt about the win
what<00:05:56.440> do<00:05:56.500> you<00:05:56.530> call<00:05:56.710> it<00:05:56.770> not<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.430> whip<00:05:57.610> pudding

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030
