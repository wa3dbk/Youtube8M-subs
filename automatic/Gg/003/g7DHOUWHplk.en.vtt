get<00:03:03.310> those<00:03:03.520> out<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.790> her<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:06.450> could<00:03:07.450> take<00:03:07.630> them

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
get those out of her I could take them

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.650 
get those out of her I could take them
out<00:03:07.900> while<00:03:08.080> they're<00:03:08.260> still<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.710> egg<00:03:09.220> form<00:03:09.660> but

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
out while they're still in egg form but

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.510 
out while they're still in egg form but
you<00:03:11.530> would<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.860> put<00:03:12.040> them<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> heater

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
you would have to put them on a heater

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.950 
you would have to put them on a heater
and<00:03:12.790> set<00:03:13.600> them<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.840> right<00:03:14.290> here<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:15.960> where

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
and set them up right here and the where

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.980 
and set them up right here and the where
the<00:03:17.110> water<00:03:17.380> comes<00:03:17.740> out<00:03:17.890> of<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.690> little<00:03:19.690> stream

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
the water comes out of the little stream

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.200 
the water comes out of the little stream
here<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:21.310> put<00:03:21.460> them<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.730> net<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
here you you put them in a net and a

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.390 
here you you put them in a net and a
heater<00:03:22.450> near<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:22.990> it<00:03:23.530> rotates<00:03:23.980> them<00:03:24.220> like

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
heater near it and it rotates them like

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.230 
heater near it and it rotates them like
it<00:03:24.520> does<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.480> mouth<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.770> female<00:03:27.240> it's

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
it does in the mouth of the female it's

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.130 
it does in the mouth of the female it's
a<00:03:28.330> lot<00:03:28.510> more<00:03:28.540> work<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.330> really<00:03:31.660> don't

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
a lot more work and and I really don't

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.400 
a lot more work and and I really don't
think<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:34.120> works<00:03:34.420> as<00:03:34.630> good<00:03:34.660> as<00:03:35.050> letting

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
think it it works as good as letting

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.630 
think it it works as good as letting
them<00:03:35.590> hold<00:03:36.430> them<00:03:36.730> until<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.980> can<00:03:39.160> tell<00:03:39.370> that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
them hold them until you can tell that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.020 
them hold them until you can tell that
they're<00:03:39.850> ready<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.390> go<00:03:40.630> which<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.700> said<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030

put a heater and this is a 10 gallon
tank<00:03:58.680> put<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.709> heater<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.130> here<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.489> want<00:04:00.640> to

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
tank put a heater in here and I want to

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.080 
tank put a heater in here and I want to
keep<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.970> around<00:04:01.230> 78<00:04:02.340> degrees<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.790> here<00:04:03.970> at

all<00:04:04.209> times<00:04:06.750> just<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.840> rock<00:04:08.049> bottom<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.769> get<00:04:08.920> a

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
all times just a rock bottom I get a

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.460 
all times just a rock bottom I get a
little<00:04:09.070> old<00:04:09.489> piece<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:09.880> coral<00:04:10.420> that's<00:04:11.200> been<00:04:11.380> in

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
little old piece of coral that's been in

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.840 
little old piece of coral that's been in
here<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.860> while<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.220> can<00:04:12.340> see<00:04:12.519> they<00:04:12.670> like

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
here for a while you can see they like

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.199 
here for a while you can see they like
getting<00:04:13.180> up<00:04:13.269> in<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.540> coral<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:15.160> they<00:04:16.000> just

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
getting up in that coral and they just

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.060 
getting up in that coral and they just
feel<00:04:16.390> safer<00:04:16.600> than<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:20.470> anyway<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.979> then

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
feel safer than that but anyway and then

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.340 
feel safer than that but anyway and then
the<00:04:21.810> main<00:04:22.810> thing<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.110> i<00:04:23.770> take<00:04:24.430> i<00:04:24.640> took<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.350> piece

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
the main thing is i take i took a piece

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.580 
the main thing is i take i took a piece
of<00:04:26.380> sponge<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.940> i<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.750> took<00:04:29.050> my<00:04:29.229> fingers

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
of sponge and i kind of took my fingers

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.180 
of sponge and i kind of took my fingers
and<00:04:29.800> pulled<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:32.050> center<00:04:32.440> out<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.890> enough

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
and pulled the center out of it enough

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.480 
and pulled the center out of it enough
to<00:04:33.370> where<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.790> would<00:04:33.910> fit<00:04:34.150> right<00:04:34.180> around<00:04:34.660> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
to where it would fit right around the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.330 
to where it would fit right around the
the<00:04:36.490> hose<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:38.080> down<00:04:38.320> from<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:40.020> intake<00:04:41.340> for

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the hose going down from the intake for

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.290 
the hose going down from the intake for
the<00:04:42.370> filter<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.919> it's<00:04:44.919> pretty<00:04:45.310> powerful<00:04:45.610> so

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
the filter and it's pretty powerful so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.810 
the filter and it's pretty powerful so
the<00:04:47.110> babies<00:04:47.440> are<00:04:47.680> not<00:04:47.890> strong<00:04:48.190> enough<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.610> swim

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
the babies are not strong enough to swim

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.980 
the babies are not strong enough to swim
away<00:04:49.090> from<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.390> current<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.810> they<00:04:49.870> get

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
away from the current and they get

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.510 
away from the current and they get
sucked<00:04:50.380> up<00:04:50.530> into<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.830> filter<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.310> lose<00:04:51.460> a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
sucked up into the filter and you lose a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.760 
sucked up into the filter and you lose a
lot<00:04:51.790> of<00:04:51.820> them<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.360> so<00:04:53.020> what<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.320> do<00:04:53.410> is<00:04:53.560> I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
lot of them like that so what I do is I

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.920 
lot of them like that so what I do is I
take<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:53.950> sponge<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:55.510> stick<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.020> on<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.440> and

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
take a sponge and I stick it on it and

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.409 
take a sponge and I stick it on it and
it<00:04:58.930> allows<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.440> water<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.740> be<00:05:00.010> filtered<00:05:00.430> but

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
it allows the water to be filtered but

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.510 
it allows the water to be filtered but
it<00:05:01.510> will<00:05:01.660> keep<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.050> babies<00:05:02.410> out<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.400> it

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
it will keep the babies out of it and it

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.050 
it will keep the babies out of it and it
also<00:05:03.669> cuts<00:05:03.970> down<00:05:04.090> on<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.479> amount

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
also cuts down on the amount

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.190 
also cuts down on the amount
current<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.750> it's<00:05:06.960> pulling<00:05:07.500> into<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.930> also<00:05:09.930> I

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
current that it's pulling into it also I

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.240 
current that it's pulling into it also I
have<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.980> filter<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.670> has<00:05:12.560> dial<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:13.920> it<00:05:14.100> where

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
have a filter that has dial on it where

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.060 
have a filter that has dial on it where
it<00:05:14.370> can<00:05:14.520> dial<00:05:14.820> down<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.680> amount<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.770> water

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
it can dial down the amount of water

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.750 
it can dial down the amount of water
being<00:05:17.460> pulled<00:05:18.240> in<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:19.440> recommend<00:05:20.040> doing

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
being pulled in and I recommend doing

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.160 
being pulled in and I recommend doing
something<00:05:21.240> like<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.630> if<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.900> plan<00:05:22.140> on

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
something like that if you plan on

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.300 
something like that if you plan on
trying<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:23.010> breed<00:05:23.250> any<00:05:23.940> kind<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.300> cichlid<00:05:25.310> to

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
trying to breed any kind of cichlid to

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.150 
trying to breed any kind of cichlid to
put<00:05:26.490> them<00:05:26.640> in<00:05:26.910> us<00:05:27.720> because<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.950> water

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
put them in us because the the water

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.480 
put them in us because the the water
that's<00:05:29.370> coming<00:05:29.490> out<00:05:29.850> will<00:05:30.950> so<00:05:31.950> powerful<00:05:32.460> that

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
that's coming out will so powerful that

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.060 
that's coming out will so powerful that
it'll<00:05:32.850> create<00:05:33.090> like<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.620> spinning<00:05:34.620> effect<00:05:34.920> in

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
it'll create like a spinning effect in

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.140 
it'll create like a spinning effect in
here<00:05:35.250> like<00:05:35.400> that<00:05:35.670> and<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.190> fish<00:05:38.880> just

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
here like that and and the the fish just

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.360 
here like that and and the the fish just
get<00:05:39.330> pulverized<00:05:39.690> and<00:05:40.260> then<00:05:40.830> they<00:05:40.950> just<00:05:41.100> stress

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
get pulverized and then they just stress

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.790 
get pulverized and then they just stress
out<00:05:41.580> and<00:05:41.840> so<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:43.800> have<00:05:44.370> one<00:05:44.580> that<00:05:44.790> has<00:05:45.320> a<00:05:46.320> little

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
out and so I have one that has a little

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.430 
out and so I have one that has a little
maybe<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:47.880> can<00:05:48.030> get<00:05:48.120> in<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.420> show<00:05:49.110> you<00:05:49.170> what<00:05:49.350> it

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
maybe I can get in and show you what it

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.140 
maybe I can get in and show you what it
looks<00:05:49.470> like<00:05:49.860> there's<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.910> little<00:05:53.030> like<00:05:54.030> a

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
looks like there's a little like a

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.330 
looks like there's a little like a
button<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.900> turn<00:05:55.290> and<00:05:55.710> it<00:05:55.890> kind<00:05:56.100> of<00:05:56.160> cuts

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
button that you turn and it kind of cuts

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.910 
button that you turn and it kind of cuts
down<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.850> amount<00:05:57.140> of<00:05:58.140> flow<00:05:58.350> it's<00:05:58.650> like<00:05:58.800> a

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
down on the amount of flow it's like a

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.620 
down on the amount of flow it's like a
it's<00:05:59.220> kind<00:05:59.640> of<00:05:59.670> like<00:05:59.760> a<00:05:59.850> butterfly<00:06:00.300> valve

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
it's kind of like a butterfly valve

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.080 
it's kind of like a butterfly valve
inside<00:06:01.590> of<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:01.920> well<00:06:02.310> let<00:06:02.670> me<00:06:02.730> turn<00:06:02.880> on<00:06:02.940> the

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
inside of it well let me turn on the

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.040 
inside of it well let me turn on the
light<00:06:03.240> and<00:06:03.270> I'll<00:06:03.450> show<00:06:03.660> you<00:06:03.690> what<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.020> looks

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
light and I'll show you what it looks

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:11.510 
light and I'll show you what it looks
like

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.089 

on<00:06:12.419> my<00:06:12.509> night<00:06:12.750> movie<00:06:13.250> and<00:06:14.250> are<00:06:14.400> thicker<00:06:16.099> not

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
on my night movie and are thicker not

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:25.490 
on my night movie and are thicker not
right<00:06:17.280> there

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.450 

anyway<00:06:26.280> you<00:06:26.340> just<00:06:26.780> just<00:06:27.780> turn<00:06:28.080> it<00:06:28.460> whichever

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
anyway you just just turn it whichever

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.050 
anyway you just just turn it whichever
way<00:06:29.610> in<00:06:29.940> and<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.900> restricts<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.530> flow<00:06:32.060> pretty

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
way in and it restricts the flow pretty

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.880 
way in and it restricts the flow pretty
neat<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.510> recommend<00:06:34.110> getting<00:06:34.350> something<00:06:34.680> like
