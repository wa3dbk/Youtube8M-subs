00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 (Small version - Pokémon documentary) 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.120
 Hello~ Is this a herbal shop? 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.720
 Herbal medicine? 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.880
 Is there anyone here? 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.240
 Oh~ little! 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.000
 What are you doing here? 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 Dr. Muyu inch? 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.940
 I don't even know that you are a herb lover. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.560
 Ha ha... Hehehe... Hehehehehehe... Oh, Ah 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.860
 Uh.... 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.480
 My friend rented this place and then watched the Pokémon ecological documentary in the back. 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.180
 Oh, can I watch it together? I haven't watched TV for a while because I slept in the tree hole. 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.340
 I don't know yeah, we can have two snacks to eat together. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.720
 I have ..... nine cans of potato chips! 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.020
 This is a small cockroach. (whispered) He brought a customer 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.900
 Hello, good friend... The film is starting. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 Pokémon, they surround us in our lives 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.380
 And they know that life is free. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.020
 Most of the time, they look like this: 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.860
 In this case, it looks like 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.420
 a human, but it is not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.740
 what! It is not human! Take it! 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.020
 Wow~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.320
 Here we rarely see the courtship between different kinds of Pokémons. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.280
 (Unicorn makes it attractive!) 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 (The tyrannical dragon blushes!) 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.900
 (The effect is very remarkable!) 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.160
 (The tyrannical dragon makes a hug!) 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 (The unicorn is fainted!) 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.360
 Let's give lovers a little privacy. 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.000
 These Pokemon are just some birds 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.800
 What are those? 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.720
 Ah, what are those? 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.940
 These Pokémons can be scientifically proven 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.340
 They look stupid 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.200
 Wow~! I have more than I want to learn. 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.020
 Insert this latest news for you 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.500
 The police led the police to surround the city’s pavilion and asked the people to stay away from it. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.460
 Oh! This is it! A pavilion! 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.720
 There must be a badge there. 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 Otaru love badge ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 The second badge! I'm coming! 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.600
 He is inside 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.880
 Do not! ! ! ! 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.620
 This is not a customer!
