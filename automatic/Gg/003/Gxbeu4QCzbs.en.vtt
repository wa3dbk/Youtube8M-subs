00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
this review I'm going to be doing a

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.190 
this review I'm going to be doing a
preview<00:00:04.380> on<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.620> nikon<00:00:05.450> d3200<00:00:06.450> which<00:00:07.049> is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
preview on the nikon d3200 which is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.520 
preview on the nikon d3200 which is
expected<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.950> announced<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.610> mid-april

expected to be announced in mid-april

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.020 
expected to be announced in mid-april
now<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.860> really<00:00:11.070> cool<00:00:11.340> thing<00:00:11.610> about<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
now the really cool thing about this

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.669 
now the really cool thing about this
camera<00:00:12.420> actually<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.080> seems<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.530> moving

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
camera actually is it seems to be moving

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.369 
camera actually is it seems to be moving
in<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.040> similar<00:00:14.429> way<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> d800<00:00:15.870> model<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in a similar way to the d800 model and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.660 
in a similar way to the d800 model and
that<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.890> actually<00:00:17.039> has<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> lot<00:00:17.640> more

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
that it actually has a lot more

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.550 
that it actually has a lot more
megapixels<00:00:18.210> than<00:00:18.660> i<00:00:18.750> would<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:18.960> previously

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
megapixels than i would have previously

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.189 
megapixels than i would have previously
anticipated<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.760> expected<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> 24

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
anticipated it's expected to have a 24

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
anticipated it's expected to have a 24
megapixel<00:00:22.800> sensor<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.369> which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> same

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
megapixel sensor on it which is the same

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.870 
megapixel sensor on it which is the same
size<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> d3x<00:00:25.920> used<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.400> only<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
size what the d3x used to have only on a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.259 
size what the d3x used to have only on a
DX<00:00:27.630> type<00:00:27.930> sensor<00:00:28.439> now<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.240> seen

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
DX type sensor now from what I've seen

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.389 
DX type sensor now from what I've seen
with<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> d800<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.500> its<00:00:31.740> high<00:00:31.920> ISO

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
with the d800 and its high ISO

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030 
with the d800 and its high ISO
capability<00:00:33.149> its<00:00:33.840> ability<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> basically<00:00:34.530> out

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
capability its ability to basically out

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.940 
capability its ability to basically out
resolve<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.000> image<00:00:36.540> quality<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> d700

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
resolve the image quality of the d700

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
resolve the image quality of the d700
even<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.309> higher<00:00:38.520> iso's<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.480> really

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
even in higher iso's which is really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.670 
even in higher iso's which is really
incredible<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:41.460> expect<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> d3200<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
incredible I expect that the d3200 to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
incredible I expect that the d3200 to
actually<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.340> similar<00:00:45.059> type<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> image

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
actually have similar type of image

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660 
actually have similar type of image
quality<00:00:45.870> change<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.680> may<00:00:47.039> even<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.340> possible

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
quality change it may even be possible

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
quality change it may even be possible
that<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.239> camera<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.780> better<00:00:49.020> image

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that this camera has better image

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 
that this camera has better image
quality<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:49.950> say<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.190> d700<00:00:51.090> model<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.570> at

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
quality than say the d700 model or at

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.760 
quality than say the d700 model or at
least<00:00:51.899> similar<00:00:52.500> image<00:00:52.949> quality<00:00:54.530> nikon<00:00:55.530> seems

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
least similar image quality nikon seems

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.979 
least similar image quality nikon seems
to<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.010> made<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> pretty<00:00:56.550> revolutionary

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
to have made a pretty revolutionary

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.810 
to have made a pretty revolutionary
impact<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.500> their<00:00:58.590> high<00:00:58.770> iso<00:00:59.160> quality<00:00:59.699> with

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
impact in their high iso quality with

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
impact in their high iso quality with
their<00:00:59.969> newer<00:01:00.090> cameras<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.260> i<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.530> high

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
their newer cameras now so i have high

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.729 
their newer cameras now so i have high
hopes<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> d3200<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.660> terms<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> atty<00:01:04.260> ASO

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
hopes for the d3200 in terms of atty ASO

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
hopes for the d3200 in terms of atty ASO
capability<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:05.880> excited<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.450> what

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
capability and I'm excited to see what

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.940 
capability and I'm excited to see what
this<00:01:06.840> camera<00:01:07.140> has<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.380> offer<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this camera has to offer when it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
this camera has to offer when it
actually<00:01:08.100> comes<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.150> i<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.930> doing

actually comes out and i will be doing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
actually comes out and i will be doing
of<00:01:10.530> course<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.890> full<00:01:11.040> review<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> d3200

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
of course a full review on the d3200

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
of course a full review on the d3200
when<00:01:13.110> i'm<00:01:13.229> able<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.710> hold<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
when i'm able to actually hold the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
when i'm able to actually hold the
camera<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.640> hands<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.450> some<00:01:15.659> sample

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
camera in my hands and get some sample

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.300 
camera in my hands and get some sample
images<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> image

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
images and take a look at the image

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
images and take a look at the image
quality<00:01:17.520> myself<00:01:18.180> some<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> other

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
quality myself some of the other

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.840 
quality myself some of the other
features<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
features that it's going to have it's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
features that it's going to have it's
going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.390> able<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> shoot<00:01:21.750> four<00:01:22.020> frames<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
going to be able to shoot four frames a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
going to be able to shoot four frames a
second<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.759> too<00:01:23.970> bad

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
second which is actually not too bad

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
second which is actually not too bad
considering<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.869> amount<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> megapixels

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
considering the amount of megapixels

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.740 
considering the amount of megapixels
that<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> has<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.460> d3x<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.390> only<00:01:27.509> shoot

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that it has the d3x could only shoot

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
that it has the d3x could only shoot
five<00:01:28.049> frames<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.500> second<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> its<00:01:29.490> full<00:01:29.700> frame

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
five frames a second in its full frame

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
five frames a second in its full frame
mode<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> isn't<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.380> far<00:01:31.740> off

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
mode so this isn't actually that far off

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
mode so this isn't actually that far off
from<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.549> nikon's<00:01:33.030> most<00:01:33.240> professional

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
from what nikon's most professional

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.140 
from what nikon's most professional
model<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.700> nikon<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.790> definitely

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
model was like nikon is definitely

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.080 
model was like nikon is definitely

taking a turn in terms of a their

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
taking a turn in terms of a their
technology<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> seems<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.439> another

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
technology and it seems to be another

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.679 
technology and it seems to be another
bump<00:01:41.130> up<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> technology<00:01:42.060> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.509> when

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
bump up in technology kind of like when

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.010 
bump up in technology kind of like when
the<00:01:42.810> d300<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> d3<00:01:44.159> originally<00:01:45.000> came<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.450> in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the d300 and d3 originally came out in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749 
the d300 and d3 originally came out in
terms<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> autofocus<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.670> an

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
terms of autofocus it's going to have an

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
terms of autofocus it's going to have an
11-point<00:01:48.360> autofocus<00:01:48.509> system<00:01:49.049> which<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> cool

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
11-point autofocus system which is cool

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340 
11-point autofocus system which is cool
and<00:01:50.159> we'll<00:01:50.340> definitely<00:01:50.869> probably<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.170> about

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and we'll definitely probably be about

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
and we'll definitely probably be about
as<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> d700<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:54.329> so

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
as good as say as the d700 or so

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
as good as say as the d700 or so
hopefully<00:01:55.259> it'll<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.219> accurate<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
hopefully it'll be about as accurate and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.420 
hopefully it'll be about as accurate and
as<00:01:57.240> quick<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.960> iso<00:01:58.439> range<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> range

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
as quick the iso range is going to range

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.120 
as quick the iso range is going to range
from<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.759> 100<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.810> 6400<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
from about 100 to 6400 and that is the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.999 
from about 100 to 6400 and that is the
native<00:02:02.280> iso<00:02:02.969> range<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.990> expandable<00:02:04.829> i

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
native iso range it will be expandable i

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.690 
native iso range it will be expandable i
believe<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.750> 12,800<00:02:06.750> ISO<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:08.069> well<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
believe up to 12,800 ISO as well and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
believe up to 12,800 ISO as well and
like<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.239> said<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.750> good<00:02:09.989> expectations<00:02:10.800> for

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
like I said I have good expectations for

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.860 
like I said I have good expectations for
hiya<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.030> camera<00:02:12.330> even

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
hiya so with this camera even

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.649 
hiya so with this camera even
so<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.379> does<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.760> quite<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.849> few<00:02:14.940> megapixels

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
so it does have quite a few megapixels

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.990 
so it does have quite a few megapixels
on<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.959> another<00:02:16.379> cool<00:02:16.620> thing<00:02:16.769> about<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> d3200

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
on it another cool thing about the d3200

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.699 
on it another cool thing about the d3200
is<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.720> expected<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> whole

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
is that it's expected to have a whole

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.440 
is that it's expected to have a whole
new<00:02:19.920> feature<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.760> expected<00:02:21.299> to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
new feature in it it's expected to

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.259 
new feature in it it's expected to
actually<00:02:21.599> have<00:02:22.019> Wi-Fi<00:02:22.970> compatibility<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
actually have Wi-Fi compatibility in it

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.550 
actually have Wi-Fi compatibility in it
and<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.780> something<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.379> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and not just something that you can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.350 
and not just something that you can
connect<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.159> it<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.640> actually<00:02:27.000> inside<00:02:27.299> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
connect to it but actually inside the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.780 
connect to it but actually inside the
camera<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.049> available<00:02:28.530> when<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.099> buy<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
camera and available when you buy the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.149 
camera and available when you buy the
camera<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:31.260> supposed<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:31.769> add

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
camera and it's supposed to actually add

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.949 
camera and it's supposed to actually add
a<00:02:32.190> couple<00:02:32.489> new<00:02:32.670> features<00:02:32.909> to<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.420> camera<00:02:33.720> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
a couple new features to the camera that

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.750 
a couple new features to the camera that
have<00:02:34.079> not<00:02:34.200> yet<00:02:34.470> been<00:02:34.860> seen<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.579> can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
have not yet been seen when I can

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.119 
have not yet been seen when I can
cameras<00:02:36.120> before<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:36.989> be<00:02:37.620> excited<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
cameras before so be excited to

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.430 
cameras before so be excited to
definitely<00:02:38.610> see<00:02:38.760> what<00:02:38.909> those<00:02:39.030> will<00:02:39.299> be<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.750> of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
definitely see what those will be and of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.199 
definitely see what those will be and of
course<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:40.920> are<00:02:41.069> possibilities<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.940> other

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
course there are possibilities of other

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.809 
course there are possibilities of other
updates<00:02:42.629> as<00:02:42.840> well<00:02:43.019> but<00:02:43.650> being<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.670> is

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
updates as well but being that it is

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.130 
updates as well but being that it is
only<00:02:45.000> speculation<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.019> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
only speculation right now and the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.270 
only speculation right now and the
camera<00:02:46.440> actually<00:02:46.560> hasn't<00:02:46.859> been<00:02:47.069> announced

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
camera actually hasn't been announced

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.650 
camera actually hasn't been announced
it's<00:02:47.549> pretty<00:02:47.760> much<00:02:47.879> all<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> information

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
it's pretty much all the information

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.900 
it's pretty much all the information
that<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:50.400> i<00:02:50.519> said<00:02:50.579> though<00:02:50.879> i

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that I have on it like i said though i

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.640 
that I have on it like i said though i
have<00:02:51.150> great<00:02:51.359> expectations<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.349> camera

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
have great expectations for this camera

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
have great expectations for this camera
this<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.549> definitely<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.239> be<00:02:54.450> an

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
this is definitely going to be an

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.509 
this is definitely going to be an
amazing<00:02:54.870> entry<00:02:55.349> model<00:02:55.470> camera<00:02:55.829> may<00:02:56.220> even

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
amazing entry model camera may even

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.729 
amazing entry model camera may even
surpass<00:02:57.060> some<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.230> cameras<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
surpass some of the cameras like the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.309 
surpass some of the cameras like the
d700<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.819> well<00:03:00.030> when<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.569> actually<00:03:00.750> comes<00:03:00.930> out

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
d700 as well when it actually comes out

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.259 
d700 as well when it actually comes out
so<00:03:01.890> I'll<00:03:02.129> be<00:03:02.250> sure<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.549> do<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> full<00:03:02.940> review<00:03:03.090> on

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
so I'll be sure to do a full review on

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.000 
so I'll be sure to do a full review on
that<00:03:03.569> camera<00:03:03.930> when<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.349> my<00:03:04.440> hands<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.829> in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that camera when I get my hands on in

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
that camera when I get my hands on in
the<00:03:05.099> future
