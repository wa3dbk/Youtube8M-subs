00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.470 
we're seeing you on left as well but a
little<00:00:17.130> more<00:00:17.310> central<00:00:17.760> playing<00:00:18.330> with<00:00:18.449> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
little more central playing with a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.450 
little more central playing with a
striker<00:00:18.779> how<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> transition<00:00:20.010> into<00:00:20.310> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
striker how is the transition into it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.429 
striker how is the transition into it
slightly<00:00:21.060> different<00:00:21.510> formation<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.050> losers

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
slightly different formation of losers

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.070 
slightly different formation of losers
system<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.070> Ancelotti<00:00:23.609> i<00:00:23.910> don't<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:24.930> i

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
system with Ancelotti i don't think so i

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.609 
system with Ancelotti i don't think so i
think<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.970> code<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> differently

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
think the code you do it differently

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
think the code you do it differently
strategics<00:00:29.310> different<00:00:29.939> positions<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.570> some

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
strategics different positions for some

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
strategics different positions for some
players<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.430> moment<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
players I think this is the moment that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.270 
players I think this is the moment that
we<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:35.010> try

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we really have to do that to try

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
we really have to do that to try
different<00:00:35.670> positions<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.510> new<00:00:37.050> system<00:00:38.600> from

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
different positions and new system from

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
different positions and new system from
it<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> good<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.950> try<00:00:41.190> different

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it it's a good to try different

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240 
it it's a good to try different
positions<00:00:41.760> maybe<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> future<00:00:43.219> but<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
positions maybe for the future but I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
positions maybe for the future but I
feel<00:00:44.460> comfortable<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.899> culture<00:00:46.140> give<00:00:46.410> me<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
feel comfortable the culture give me the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.569 
feel comfortable the culture give me the
possibility<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> play<00:00:48.800> where<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.280> play

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
