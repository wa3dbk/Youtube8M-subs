00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
started the first one is I recommend

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
started the first one is I recommend
using<00:00:11.190> shimmery<00:00:11.760> eyeshadow<00:00:12.330> instead<00:00:12.930> of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
using shimmery eyeshadow instead of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.410 
using shimmery eyeshadow instead of
matte<00:00:13.680> eyeshadow<00:00:14.220> just<00:00:14.340> because<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.120> flash

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
matte eyeshadow just because the flash

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.150 
matte eyeshadow just because the flash
from<00:00:15.720> the<00:00:15.780> camera<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.039> reflect

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
from the camera it's going to reflect

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.340 
from the camera it's going to reflect
off<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:18.180> eyeshadow<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.869> actually<00:00:19.199> make

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
off your eyeshadow and actually make

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.590 
off your eyeshadow and actually make
your<00:00:19.440> eyes<00:00:19.619> look<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.880> wider<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
your eyes look a little like wider and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.939 
your eyes look a little like wider and
brighter<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.110> bigger<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> things<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.890> that

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
brighter and bigger and things like that

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.490 
brighter and bigger and things like that
the<00:00:23.580> second<00:00:23.940> thing<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.810> along<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> same

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the second thing is going along the same

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.769 
the second thing is going along the same
lines<00:00:25.770> of<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.100> would<00:00:26.400> recommend<00:00:26.880> doing<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lines of that I would recommend doing a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
lines of that I would recommend doing a
not<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.470> shimmery<00:00:28.800> blush<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.640> put<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
not so shimmery blush you can put a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.099 
not so shimmery blush you can put a
little<00:00:29.939> highlight<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.930> gonna

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
little highlight on which is gonna

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
little highlight on which is gonna
highlight<00:00:31.439> your<00:00:31.529> cheekbones<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.579> write<00:00:32.880> down

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
highlight your cheekbones but write down

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.940 
highlight your cheekbones but write down
here<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:33.960> blush<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.559> bronzer<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
here like your blush in your bronzer I

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830 
here like your blush in your bronzer I
recommend<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> should<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:35.940> matte<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> then

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
recommend it should be matte and then

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
recommend it should be matte and then
also<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.230> wouldn't<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> super<00:00:38.489> glittery

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
also I wouldn't do a super glittery

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.150 
also I wouldn't do a super glittery
gloss<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.260> more<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> shiny<00:00:40.890> gloss

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
gloss I would do more of a shiny gloss

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
gloss I would do more of a shiny gloss
I've<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.640> filmed<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> way<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.660> light

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I've just filmed that the way the light

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
I've just filmed that the way the light
bounces<00:00:43.710> off<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> stuff<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.460> makes<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
bounces off and stuff it just makes it a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.900 
bounces off and stuff it just makes it a
little<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.690> prettier<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.980> pictures<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.700> if

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
little bit prettier in pictures then if

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.220 
little bit prettier in pictures then if
you<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> super<00:00:48.750> chunky<00:00:49.140> monkey

glitter gloss keep in mind this might be

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
glitter gloss keep in mind this might be
a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:52.110> bit<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.500> dramatic<00:00:52.980> than<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.309> are

colors on the lower lash line now I'm

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.430 
colors on the lower lash line now I'm

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
a Mac eye shadow in beauty marks and I'm

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.870 
a Mac eye shadow in beauty marks and I'm
going<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.870> use<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.290> 222<00:03:25.980> crease<00:03:26.340> brush<00:03:26.670> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
going to use the 222 crease brush and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.240 
going to use the 222 crease brush and
start<00:03:27.630> applying<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> outer<00:03:28.800> corner

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
start applying this in the outer corner

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.220 
start applying this in the outer corner
this<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.460> totally<00:03:30.060> an<00:03:30.150> optional<00:03:30.690> step<00:03:30.960> that<00:03:31.170> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
this is totally an optional step that I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.110 
this is totally an optional step that I
wanted<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> deepen<00:03:32.100> my<00:03:32.220> look<00:03:32.460> up<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.700> little<00:03:32.850> bit

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
wanted to deepen my look up a little bit

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.240 
wanted to deepen my look up a little bit
and<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.660> find<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.110> if<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.350> use<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> darker

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and I find that if you use a darker

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.730 
and I find that if you use a darker
purple<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.360> actually<00:03:36.500> looks<00:03:37.500> a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
purple like this it actually looks a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.170 
purple like this it actually looks a
little<00:03:37.920> bit<00:03:38.160> better<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.640> think

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
little bit better I think

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.330 
little bit better I think
then<00:03:39.360> using<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.080> another<00:03:40.470> dark<00:03:40.830> brown<00:03:41.130> I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
then using just another dark brown I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.740 
then using just another dark brown I
find<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.700> gives<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.120> little<00:03:42.360> bit<00:03:42.540> more

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
find it gives it a little bit more

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.290 
find it gives it a little bit more
dimension<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:44.280> going<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.820> look

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
dimension and it's going to look

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.710 
dimension and it's going to look
warmer<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.810> pictures

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
warmer in pictures
