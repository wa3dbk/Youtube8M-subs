00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 today we are going to do half of it but 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.720
 rest assured that this does not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.560
 we walk crazy in the previous chapter not 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.510
 we had recipes because we did not do 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.029
 great dedication to the world already 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.740
 you can see it and continue here 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.590
 we are partying 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.180
 this week we come back with the recipes that 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.220
 let's make a lot of meat for all 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.140
 fanatics thrown into Havana today we go 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.480
 to make a very rare cut to nanite 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.480
 also known as hiding or cutting 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.879
 of the butcher is only one every half res 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.190
 and it's very scarce that's why it cost us 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.860
 us a lot to get it said 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.290
 The butcher saves for the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.710
 rich that's where the name comes from 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.750
 we have the little hand as you will see it is a cut 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.379
 pretty boy about 100 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.570
 grams and is located attached to the bone 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 the hip of the cow has enough 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.199
 fat I hope this gives it a flavor 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.290
 awesome when we cook it to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.290
 strong fire turn back a delicacy 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.720
 to give a share of flavor we do 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.710
 is to marinate the spider in oil 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 olive thyme garlic and pepper leave it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 there a few hours if you can night 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.260
 whole was going to be deluxe Galician 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.630
 like the diego from the grill before 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.080
 throw them drain the matter that the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080
 oil 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.900
 strong 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 ai ai ai ai ai ai this is the time that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.299
 always wait they leave 7 minutes for 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 side back and forth nothing more and then 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.039
 to enjoy them to 2 is to bring 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.319
 the spaces always with people wanted 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.969
 more than food is a ritual 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.210
 that's why you have to enjoy every 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.040
 moment 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.040
 at the moment it looks 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.450

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.659
 gives 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.110
