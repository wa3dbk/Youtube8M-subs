00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so if you are using your civil

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.680 
so if you are using your civil
engineering<00:00:57.030> reference<00:00:57.510> manual<00:00:58.520> I'm

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.270 
equation twenty-eight point three zero
and<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.700> talks<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.240> about<00:01:06.299> Bo<00:01:06.840> D<00:01:07.939> which<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
and it talks a lot about Bo D which is a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.149 
and it talks a lot about Bo D which is a
basically<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.460> oxygen<00:01:11.850> demand<00:01:12.750> biochemical

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
basically your oxygen demand biochemical

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.120 
basically your oxygen demand biochemical
oxygen<00:01:14.159> demand<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:16.140> equation<00:01:16.560> says

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
oxygen demand and this equation says

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
oxygen demand and this equation says

incubated for five days your Bo d is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.050 
incubated for five days your Bo d is

this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.340> equal<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> do<00:02:00.170> F<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> minus<00:02:04.040> 3.7<00:02:05.040> all

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
this is equal to do F so minus 3.7 all

which is basically the volume of the
whole<00:02:17.379> bottle<00:02:19.170> 350<00:02:20.609> because<00:02:21.609> you're<00:02:21.760> taking

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
whole bottle 350 because you're taking

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.179 
whole bottle 350 because you're taking
the<00:02:22.269> sample<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:22.959> adding<00:02:23.620> water<00:02:24.609> to<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
the sample and adding water to it and

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.890 
the sample and adding water to it and
you<00:02:27.189> can<00:02:27.370> only<00:02:27.489> fill<00:02:27.790> up<00:02:27.969> what<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.420> bottle<00:02:28.750> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you can only fill up what the bottle is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.309 
you can only fill up what the bottle is
so<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.409> 350<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.090> we<00:02:31.450> solve<00:02:31.719> for<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.049> what

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
so it's 350 so we solve for that what

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.479 
so it's 350 so we solve for that what
does<00:02:32.409> that<00:02:32.469> give<00:02:32.769> us<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.950> gives<00:02:33.310> us<00:02:34.290> 63

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
does that give us that gives us 63

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.490 
does that give us that gives us 63
there's<00:02:36.489> another<00:02:36.760> equation<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.629> use<00:02:37.659> to<00:02:38.200> solve

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
there's another equation to use to solve

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.390 
there's another equation to use to solve
for<00:02:39.010> ultimate<00:02:40.590> VOD<00:02:41.590> which<00:02:41.859> is<00:02:42.040> what<00:02:42.219> we're

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
for ultimate VOD which is what we're

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.000 
for ultimate VOD which is what we're
asked<00:02:42.609> to<00:02:42.760> find<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.439> if<00:02:44.439> you<00:02:44.590> look<00:02:44.799> at

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
asked to find and if you look at

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
asked to find and if you look at
equation<00:02:46.470> 28.3<00:02:47.470> -<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:48.879> states<00:02:49.359> that<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:51.010> your

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
equation 28.3 - it states that if your

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.170 
equation 28.3 - it states that if your
deoxygenation<00:02:52.930> rate<00:02:53.319> is<00:02:54.629> 0.1<00:02:55.709> per<00:02:56.709> day<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
deoxygenation rate is 0.1 per day the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.569 
deoxygenation rate is 0.1 per day the
ultimate<00:02:58.629> VOD<00:02:59.079> can<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.439> approximated<00:03:00.310> from

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
ultimate VOD can be approximated from

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.750 
ultimate VOD can be approximated from
this<00:03:00.790> equation<00:03:01.419> and<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:02.469> states<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.250> VOD

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
this equation and it states the the VOD

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.890 
this equation and it states the the VOD
you<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.900> ultimate<00:03:05.019> VOD<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:06.510> basically<00:03:07.510> equal

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
you the ultimate VOD is basically equal

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.729 
you the ultimate VOD is basically equal
to<00:03:07.930> one<00:03:08.200> point<00:03:08.469> four<00:03:08.919> six<00:03:09.219> three<00:03:09.930> times<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
to one point four six three times the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.990 
to one point four six three times the
five-day<00:03:12.329> VOD<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.769> what's<00:03:15.189> one<00:03:15.430> point<00:03:15.729> four

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
five-day VOD so what's one point four

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.530 
five-day VOD so what's one point four
six<00:03:16.389> three<00:03:16.900> times<00:03:17.319> 63<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.840> gives<00:03:20.229> me<00:03:21.540> ninety

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
six three times 63 that gives me ninety

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.699 
six three times 63 that gives me ninety
two<00:03:22.750> point<00:03:24.510> nine<00:03:25.510> two<00:03:25.989> point<00:03:26.440> two<00:03:27.510> milligrams

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
two point nine two point two milligrams

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.170 
two point nine two point two milligrams
per<00:03:29.709> liter<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.629> is<00:03:31.750> most<00:03:32.079> nearly<00:03:32.699> B<00:03:33.699> so

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
per liter and that is most nearly B so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.679 
per liter and that is most nearly B so
I'm<00:03:34.239> going<00:03:34.419> to<00:03:34.479> say<00:03:34.659> B<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.729> so<00:03:36.729> this<00:03:37.479> is<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
I'm going to say B on this so this is a

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.259 
I'm going to say B on this so this is a
good<00:03:37.930> environmental<00:03:38.739> question<00:03:39.269> there's

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
good environmental question there's

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.960 
good environmental question there's
usually<00:03:40.449> something<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:41.859> can<00:03:42.459> be<00:03:42.549> thrown<00:03:42.819> at

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
usually something that can be thrown at

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.969 
usually something that can be thrown at
you<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:43.359> B<00:03:43.629> OD<00:03:43.989> or<00:03:44.019> any<00:03:44.470> type<00:03:44.769> of

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
you with B OD or any type of

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.129 
you with B OD or any type of
environmental<00:03:45.579> type<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.299> question<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.959> too

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
environmental type of question not too

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.729 
environmental type of question not too
many<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.609> is<00:03:48.729> a<00:03:48.759> good<00:03:49.000> one<00:03:49.150> -<00:03:49.359> so<00:03:49.720> head<00:03:50.620> on

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
many but this is a good one - so head on
