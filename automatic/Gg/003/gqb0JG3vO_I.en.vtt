00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.940
 here we have what is the case 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 with included battery we see that here 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 has the typical 30-ping entry of the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.380
 Iphone 4 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.300
 and we see that it has 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.179
 the usb mini usb connector that is this 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.779
 it connects here and through usb 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.509
 charges the battery and how are we going to 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.269
 Check if the battery has charge 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.960
 the good housing we only press 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.960
 this button 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.200
 and turn on the lights 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.230
 if you understand the four lights is that 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.050
 is 100% charged so this is the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.730
 battery level we see here 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.770
 We find what we are born 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.810
 technical specifications of the battery 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:02.380
 and also the spaces so that the 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.100
 sound of the horns of our 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.100
 iphone 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.250
 also here we see the camera slot 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.190
 above we see in the connector of the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.150
 headphones on the side we have the ones from the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.570
 button volume buttons and lock 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.640
 then we will proceed to install 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.759
 here is the power button and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.470
 off of the battery that is the case 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.470
 then to install it is very easy 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.690
 we remove the top part to the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.480
 sheath 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.260
 and it is in two parts 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:50.420
 then the only thing we have to do 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.909
 is embed our iphone enters 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.350
 to perfection 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.069
 and we connect it and we only put it 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.069
 The top 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 who clicks then 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.710
 we put it this way 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.220
 and ready here we see that it is already placed 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.880
 another thing that I would like to tell you about 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 this case is that it protects you very well 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.690
 iPhone of falls and gives you a better 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.360
 volume to size does not do not look very fat 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.610
 and at the same time it gives you the grip 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.780
 enough that we need since 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.780
 our iphone 4 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.760
 usually good in my case I 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.590
 battalion to grab him in that is too much 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.770
 small for me then that's why I bought 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.830
 the bumper 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.680
 so that I had a better grip with 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.500
 this also saves us that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.890
 we can grab it better gives us the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.780
 extra battery and then now when 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.680
 we are running out of batteries as in 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.250
 my case that I have 19% left the only 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.030
 we have to do is and here what 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.030
 we light 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.100
 and ready
