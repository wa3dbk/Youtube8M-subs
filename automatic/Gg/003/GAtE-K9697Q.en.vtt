the hair you'll call me through into the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.530 
the hair you'll call me through into the
hair<00:01:08.950> straight<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.520> home<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:10.060> only<00:01:10.240> want<00:01:10.510> to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
hair straight is a home you only want to

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.040 
hair straight is a home you only want to
remove<00:01:10.810> only<00:01:11.170> about<00:01:11.850> 80%<00:01:12.850> of<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.000> curl<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
remove only about 80% of the curl so the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.920 
remove only about 80% of the curl so the
hair<00:01:14.229> should<00:01:14.380> have<00:01:14.800> some<00:01:14.950> curl<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.970> it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
hair should have some curl to it and it

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.440 
hair should have some curl to it and it
just<00:01:17.170> relaxes<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.650> curl<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:17.979> there<00:01:18.070> okay<00:01:18.909> why

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
just relaxes the curl in there okay why

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.120

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
only want to remove any percent and then

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.260 
only want to remove any percent and then
100%<00:01:22.930> because<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:24.790> very<00:01:25.119> great

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
100% because that is a very great

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.820 
100% because that is a very great
question<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.990> lot<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.380> people<00:01:26.560> think<00:01:26.740> that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
question a lot of people think that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.310 
question a lot of people think that
you're<00:01:27.009> supposed<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.400> mean<00:01:27.610> remove<00:01:28.420> 100%<00:01:29.050> of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
you're supposed to mean remove 100% of

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.260 
you're supposed to mean remove 100% of
the<00:01:29.440> curl<00:01:29.619> but<00:01:29.860> what<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.100> does<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.910> strips

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the curl but what that does is it strips

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.719 
the curl but what that does is it strips
the<00:01:31.420> few<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.720> them<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.560> imagine<00:01:33.280> when<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:33.490> have

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
the few of them so imagine when you have

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.480 
the few of them so imagine when you have
a<00:01:34.030> rock<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.990> rubber<00:01:35.410> band<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.740> has<00:01:36.009> been<00:01:36.160> over

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
a rock a rubber band that has been over

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.219 
a rock a rubber band that has been over
stretched<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:37.240> keep<00:01:37.690> stretching<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.170> you

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
stretched you keep stretching that you

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.660 
stretched you keep stretching that you
keep<00:01:38.380> stretching<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.830> when<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:39.250> could<00:01:39.430> relax

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
keep stretching it when you could relax

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.800 
keep stretching it when you could relax
earlier<00:01:40.030> that's<00:01:40.240> what<00:01:40.420> you're<00:01:40.570> doing<00:01:40.660> you're

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
earlier that's what you're doing you're

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.990 
earlier that's what you're doing you're
stretching<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.380> rubber<00:01:41.619> band<00:01:41.860> okay<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:42.640> when

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
stretching that rubber band okay so when

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.730 
stretching that rubber band okay so when
