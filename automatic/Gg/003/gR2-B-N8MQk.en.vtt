low<00:00:56.219> cost<00:00:56.460> flash<00:00:56.760> dryer<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.750> you're

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
low cost flash dryer and what you're

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900 
low cost flash dryer and what you're
actually<00:00:58.079> paying<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:59.370> lower<00:00:59.609> cost

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
actually paying for your lower cost

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
actually paying for your lower cost
option<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.780> coil<00:01:01.109> unit<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:02.039> coin<00:01:02.370> unit<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
option is the coil unit now coin unit is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.030 
option is the coil unit now coin unit is
lower<00:01:02.910> cost<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.809> made<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
lower cost because a made out of the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.200 
lower cost because a made out of the
country<00:01:05.400> some<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> our<00:01:05.820> main<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.150> the

country the ones that are made in the
country<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.760> less<00:01:09.350> sturdy<00:01:10.460> easier<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> put

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
country much less sturdy easier to put

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.060 
country much less sturdy easier to put
together<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.140> most<00:01:13.350> expensive<00:01:13.710> part<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
together and the most expensive part of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
together and the most expensive part of
the<00:01:14.159> flash<00:01:14.400> dryer<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> coil<00:01:15.299> element

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the flash dryer is a coil element

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
the flash dryer is a coil element
now<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.380> coil<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.130> units<00:01:17.400> are

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
now these coil of your units are

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
now these coil of your units are
actually<00:01:17.790> meant<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.150> ovens<00:01:19.140> they're

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
actually meant for ovens they're

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.170 
actually meant for ovens they're
infrared<00:01:20.070> heat<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.659> low<00:01:21.930> cost<00:01:22.170> coil

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
infrared heat but a very low cost coil

infrared heat but a very low cost coil
infrared<00:01:24.180> unit<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> quality<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
infrared unit now what a quality and it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
infrared unit now what a quality and it
does<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.450> obviously<00:01:27.840> cheaper<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
does it's obviously cheaper because it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
does it's obviously cheaper because it's
less<00:01:28.920> complex<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:29.640> together<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
less complex to put together and it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.840 
less complex to put together and it
provides<00:01:31.170> heat<00:01:31.500> radiating<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.520> coil

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
provides heat radiating out of the coil

provides heat radiating out of the coil
the<00:01:33.659> white<00:01:33.869> infrared<00:01:34.320> heat<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.619> actually

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the white infrared heat is actually

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.399 
the white infrared heat is actually
created<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.579> by<00:01:35.759> resistance<00:01:36.390> within<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.110> coil

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
created is by resistance within the coil

difficult<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.730> cure<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.270> white<00:03:20.540> ink

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
difficult to cure because the white ink

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.900 
difficult to cure because the white ink
actually<00:03:20.959> reflects<00:03:21.950> away<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.489> heat<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.850> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
actually reflects away the heat of the

actually reflects away the heat of the
flash<00:03:23.150> dryer<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.140> let's<00:03:24.290> rotate<00:03:24.470> our<00:03:24.830> printing

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489

palette underneath the Flash dryer we

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.590

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
should get a consistent heat using this

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.960 
should get a consistent heat using this

couple seconds or thought were within
five<00:03:37.370> degrees<00:03:37.790> all<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.120> way<00:03:38.480> across<00:03:38.840> the

surface of the ink our end result is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.270 
surface of the ink our end result is
sure<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:41.989> it's<00:03:42.110> completely<00:03:42.560> cured<00:03:42.860> evenly

from<00:03:43.459> top<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.700> bottom<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.300> we<00:03:44.540> can<00:03:44.570> prove<00:03:44.840> that

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
from top to bottom and we can prove that

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.199 
from top to bottom and we can prove that
once<00:03:45.170> again<00:03:45.410> by<00:03:45.890> doing<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.340> stretch<00:03:46.640> test<00:03:47.000> on

once again by doing a stretch test on
the<00:03:47.540> white<00:03:47.750> ink<00:03:48.489> now<00:03:49.489> we'll<00:03:49.640> rotate<00:03:49.820> our<00:03:50.239> coil

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the white ink now we'll rotate our coil

actually be fairly easy to cure now what

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.420 
actually be fairly easy to cure now what
can<00:03:57.110> also<00:03:57.290> happen<00:03:57.530> with<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:57.860> coil<00:03:58.130> flash

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
areas following the coil so we're going

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.670 
areas following the coil so we're going
to<00:04:08.390> slightly<00:04:08.570> over<00:04:08.989> through<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.260> garment
