00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.970
 the roberto marinho foundation presents 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.970
 2012 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.169
 it's not like this 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.170
 protect forests 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.289
 establish limits for the exploitation of its resources and ensure the 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.240
 continuity of environmental services 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.590
 the law that defines the rules for the use of our forests 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 was established in 1934 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 and has undergone a reformulation in 1965 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.420
 when apps were created 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.620
 the areas of permanent preservation 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680
 and legal reserves 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.870
 are defined as apps 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.300
 all areas that guarantee the maintenance of water resources as 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.330
 the banks of rivers lakes and springs 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.320
 are also permanently preserving the areas responsible for 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.530
 stabilization of slopes such as the tops of hills 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.890
 removing the vegetation from river banks contributes to silting 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.750
 increasing the velocity of the waters a process that causes erosions 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.110
 a study released by the ministry of the environment 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.079
 revealed that 92% 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.759
 landslides in the Rio de Janeiro mountainous region were 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.590
 wrong propositions 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.079
 the legal reserves 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.130
 are areas within rural properties intended for the conservation of 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.729
 wildlife biodiversity 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.080
 and flora 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.360
 in legal reserve areas, deforestation is prohibited 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.430
 but it is allowed to use with sustained management legal reserves allow the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.420
 transit of animals between conservation units 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.580
 forming ecological corridors 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.600
 which also ensures the genetic exchange between plants of different 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.230
 fragments 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.540
 a new change in legislation has been proposed by deputies and senators 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.109
 more than a decade ago 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.629
 May 2011 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.659
 new text has been approved by the Chamber of Deputies and is now being 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.259
 analyzed by the senate 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.309
 but divergences continue 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.239
 because it is the forest code is generating so much controversy and mobilizing the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.249
 society 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.249
 this is what today's program will try to answer 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 we 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.799
 but 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.139
 amnesty 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.829
 relaxation 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.629
 there are many points in the forest code that provoked heated debates 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.840
 but what are the consequences of the changes 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.319
 our lives 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.350
 in the face of controversy, Brazilian scientists will decide whether to mobilize 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.610
 and created a document with technical information on each of the items of the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.119
 legislation 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.539
 climatologist carlos nobre was one of the scientists who was part of the 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.359
 sbpc work 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.699
 Brazilian society for the advancement of science and the Brazilian academy of 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.549
 sciences that organized the document forest code and science 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.159
 contributions to the dialogue 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.640
 with the victory paulo 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.350
 is like one of the most important Brazilian laws of nature protection 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.349
 cfk guarantees 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.849
 that agriculture and livestock farming in our country can develop 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.389
 and maintaining our enormous biodiversity guaranteeing the quality of water and here 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.009
 also keeping the soil very important solution to maintain the fertility of the 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.869
 agriculture 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:54.049
 twist the forest code the process and development of Brazil of the 20th century 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.549
 would have been much more devastating than the 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.659
 so it is very important that we have legislation 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:07.019
 to protect biodiversity now vilson koch for the climatologist if the 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.719
 current forest code was followed to the letter 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.589
 everyone would win 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.619
 co code 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.629
 in its entirety 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.669
 was actually applied 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.300
 Brazil would have much - environmental problems today than it does 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:25.409
 for example 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.879
 occupation 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.169
 in the two Brazilian cities 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.070
 floodplain areas of the rivers that generate so many 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.999
 natural disasters with deaths from injuries 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:41.719
 the forestry code would not allow such a marked occupation of floodplains 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.889
 one of the wires usually leaving their beds extravaza unclean 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.150
 then this is a small example berlin no code application not to 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.090
 code application 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.520
 in many areas by Brazilian agriculture 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.479
 represents an enormous loss of fertile soils erosion in Brazil is a 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.919
 agricultural problem 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.120
 team and in the code in many cases was not applied properly then if the 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.279
 been applied today we would have much more natural resources 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.889
 and agriculture and would be the main beneficiary
