00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
school year I had a streak where I like

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
school year I had a streak where I like
a<00:01:10.890> streak<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.640> months<00:01:12.000> where<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
a streak of one or two months where I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240 
a streak of one or two months where I
was<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.200> consistent<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> videos

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
was pretty consistent with the videos
