00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.930
 and 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.029
 or the time I want to teach how to make a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.009
 Black server cake are a few 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 ingredients so we're going to do it 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.410
 by parts and so we will not have any mess 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.529
 in principle we are going to make the cake 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 this cake is chocolate 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:38.850
 we need 170 grams of sugar 130 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.690
 grams of flour is that line of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.250
 pastries to make beautiful also 60 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.470
 grams of cocoa half a half cup of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.440
 oil another half a cup of milk 7 eggs 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.410
 20 grams of cornmeal or cornstarch and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.290
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.570
 let's beat our lands together with 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.550
 sugar and this we will do at speed 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.550
 maximum until they publish the volume 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.100
 Y 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.140
 [Music] 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.990
 and in a bowl we will also do all the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.710
 Dry ingredients 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 [Music] 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.200
 we already have our eggs that still 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.840
 they increased a lot with the sugar you see 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.090
 It has been exactly one cream and now 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.159
 previously we will add a little bit to 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.590
 little the flour with the rest of the 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.759
 dry ingredients this we will do very 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.759
 slowly and enveloping 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.430
 [Music] 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.369
 and now integra we also see the oil 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.369
 and milk too slowly 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:15.950
 [Music] 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.380
 and we're also going to oil and analyze 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.040
 three sources at this time I have two 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.790
 but there will be three remember three these are 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 of 21 centimeters by 25 we will do three 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.650
 plates 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.650
 [Music] 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.320
 [Music] 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.110
 Y 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.050
 [Music] 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.720
 we will have the oven preheated to 170 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.080
 degrees up and down and this will be 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.330
 about 15 or 20 minutes when 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.030
 we punctured and we took out clean they were already 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.410
 made and for the syrup of this cake 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.140
 it would need sugar water and liquor 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.880
 cherries let's skip the liquor put 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.300
 We are going to make this recipe too 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.910
 for children but the original recipe 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.850
 I would take cherry liqueur simply 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.490
 I'm going to put 150 grams of sugar and a 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.800
 little glass of water and to give it a little touch 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.210
 of flavor we will put a little bit of 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.550
 vanilla essence that this is optional 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.850
 the syrup is to introduce the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.160
 sugar with water and with the essence or 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.880
 liquor that we have chosen so 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.170
 it will simply be adding the sugar 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.620
 liquor and water in this case just water and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.430
 the teaspoon of vanilla essence 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.710
 let's reduce about 5 or 6 minutes in 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.240
 that moment will be ready 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.709
 i 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.900
 [Music] 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.959
 basically the real black forest cake is 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.310
 make up of cream I'm going to make a 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.680
 special version and I'll put truffle going 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.640
 to be half a liter of whipped cream or 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.769
 whipped cream and truffle these 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.440
 two I'll put you in the little box 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.530
 information so you can access 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.020
 it and it's easier to do it 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.800
 in this way we also need like 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.220
 half a kilo of cherries these cherries 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.190
 they are usually in their own liquor 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.550
 cherries is as it is for children 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.130
 Let them in syrup these have I 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.360
 bought like this in syrup too 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.129
 you can substitute for an evening of cherries 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.090
 the decoration is also composed 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:50.009
 basically chocolate chips 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.310
 we'll say a little bit of dark chocolate or 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:57.020
 with milk and we will make some strips with a 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.470
 spatula or just with your fingers 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.470
 [Music] 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:16.000
 and 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:16.000
 [Music] 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.400
 and now we are going to fill and decorate 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.130
 our cake first we will make it wet 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.470
 a little the cake for the active one that 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.839
 we prepare 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.839
 [Music] 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.970
 all right 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.960
 of this cream we will reserve a little bit for 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.960
 the final decoration 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.610
 [Music] 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.360
 the rest we add it to this first 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:08.120
 but 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:08.120
 [Music] 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:35.670
 [Music] 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.140
 and again we put the cherries 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.449
 we will reserve a few for the 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.430
 decor 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.920
 i 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.230
 [Music] 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.789
 to 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.979
 [Music] 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:57.080
 we open with another base of sponge cake 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:00.999
 we will bathe with the syrup and cover 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.999
 with the rest of the truffle 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.330
 [Music] 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
 all right 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:23.580
 [Music] 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.950
 i 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.070
 [Music] 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.070
 i 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.939
 [Music] 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.610
 Y 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.610
 [Music] 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:50.349
 i 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:50.349
 [Music] 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.680
 and this is the result of our cover 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.650
 I recommend that the comma is a day for 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.600
 another one ' is always much richer 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.730
