videos<00:00:06.140> I'd<00:00:07.140> like<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.620> show<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.919> how<00:00:08.220> I

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
videos I'd like to show you how I

conditioned<00:00:09.059> clay<00:00:09.469> many<00:00:10.469> people<00:00:10.950> are<00:00:11.280> lucky

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
conditioned clay many people are lucky

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.220 
conditioned clay many people are lucky
enough<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.719> get<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> go<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.230> classes<00:00:13.980> or<00:00:15.049> to<00:00:16.049> go

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
enough to get to go to classes or to go

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.590 
enough to get to go to classes or to go
to<00:00:16.289> retreats<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.279> see<00:00:17.460> how<00:00:17.580> other<00:00:17.850> people<00:00:18.330> do

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
to retreats and see how other people do

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.810 
to retreats and see how other people do
things<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.320> some<00:00:19.650> people<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.490> home

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
things but some people are at home

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.849 
things but some people are at home
learning<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.470> their<00:00:22.830> own

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
learning to do all of this on their own

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.460 
learning to do all of this on their own
so<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:24.119> thought<00:00:24.330> we'd<00:00:24.539> address<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.109> really

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
so we thought we'd address some really

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.740 
so we thought we'd address some really
simple<00:00:25.800> issues<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> conditioning

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
simple issues and one is conditioning

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.839 
simple issues and one is conditioning
clay<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.070> reason<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:29.670> taking

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
clay and the reason that we're taking

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.569 
clay and the reason that we're taking
the<00:00:30.150> time<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.550> are

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the time to do this is because there are

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.049 
the time to do this is because there are
two<00:00:32.850> factors<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.380> believe<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.579> strong

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
two factors that I believe make strong

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170 
two factors that I believe make strong
clay<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.430> clay<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:38.940> been

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
clay one is that the clay has been

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.400 
clay one is that the clay has been
conditioned<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.590> other<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
conditioned and the other is that is it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.709 
conditioned and the other is that is it
has<00:00:43.649> been<00:00:43.860> baked<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> proper<00:00:45.149> temperature

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
has been baked at the proper temperature

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.560 
has been baked at the proper temperature
for<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> proper<00:00:46.500> length<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.890> time<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> those

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
for the proper length of time so those

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
for the proper length of time so those
are<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:48.930> important<00:00:49.620> things<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.460> lot<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
are my two important things a lot of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
are my two important things a lot of
times<00:00:51.239> people<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.960> condition<00:00:52.530> clay

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
times people don't condition clay

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
times people don't condition clay
because<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.430> run<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> through<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.300> clay

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
because they run it through the clay

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.130 
because they run it through the clay
conditioning<00:00:55.739> machine<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.489> clay<00:00:57.480> dedicated

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
conditioning machine or clay dedicated

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.580 
conditioning machine or clay dedicated
pasta<00:00:58.649> machine<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.210> clay<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.660> soft<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
pasta machine and the clay is soft so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
pasta machine and the clay is soft so
they<00:01:02.010> figure<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> condition<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
they figure I don't have to condition it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
they figure I don't have to condition it
but<00:01:04.260> that's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.650> true<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.369> clay<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.180> be

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
but that's not true the clay has to be

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.109 
but that's not true the clay has to be
conditioned<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.070> materials<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
conditioned so all the materials in it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.950 
conditioned so all the materials in it
get<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.510> mix<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.250> clay<00:01:11.520> becomes

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
get to mix up and the clay becomes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.039 
get to mix up and the clay becomes
homogenized<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> bar

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
homogenized so what I do is I take a bar

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.590 
homogenized so what I do is I take a bar
of<00:01:16.200> clay<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.100> unwrapped<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.850> usually

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of clay which I've unwrapped I usually

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
of clay which I've unwrapped I usually
save<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> wrappers<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
save the wrappers because that's what I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
save the wrappers because that's what I
wrap<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.299> unused<00:01:21.930> clay<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:24.720> cut<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
wrap my unused clay up in and I cut it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.390 
wrap my unused clay up in and I cut it
into<00:01:26.159> sections<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:30.619> I've<00:01:31.619> done<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> very<00:01:32.009> even

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
into sections and I've done a very even

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.120 
into sections and I've done a very even
job<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.290> cut<00:01:34.290> into<00:01:34.650> three<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.100> four

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
job here I cut into three or four

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
job here I cut into three or four
sections<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:36.740> even<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.110> everyone

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
sections as even as I can and everyone

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
sections as even as I can and everyone
will<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.409> happy<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.759> not

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
will be happy to know that this is not

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.870 
will be happy to know that this is not
the<00:01:42.119> softest<00:01:42.630> clay<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.369> reason<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the softest clay but one reason that I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.990 
the softest clay but one reason that I
picked<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.799> pearls<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.939> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
picked out one of the pearls this is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.719 
picked out one of the pearls this is
purple<00:01:51.570> pearl<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.250> easier<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
purple pearl is it's a little easier to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.090 
purple pearl is it's a little easier to
see<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.600> mixed<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
see when it's mixed up because all the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.730 
see when it's mixed up because all the
pearl<00:01:56.759> gets<00:01:57.060> mixed<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> can

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
pearl gets mixed I don't know if you can

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
pearl gets mixed I don't know if you can
see<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.219> closely<00:01:59.689> but<00:02:00.689> when<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> first<00:02:01.259> cut

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
see this closely but when you first cut

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.910 
see this closely but when you first cut
open<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.189> bar<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.759> pearl<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.630> metallic<00:02:04.259> clay<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
open a bar of pearl or metallic clay it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.850 
open a bar of pearl or metallic clay it
has<00:02:05.610> lines<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> different

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
has lines in it of the different

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.010 
has lines in it of the different
ingredients<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.629> we're<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.899> do

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
ingredients and what we're going to do

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
strain on the rollers and all I knew as

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960 
strain on the rollers and all I knew as
I<00:02:29.560> roll<00:02:29.830> one<00:02:30.130> piece

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
I roll one piece

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.390 
I roll one piece
the<00:02:31.630> next<00:02:32.140> piece<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.920> take<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.250> two

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the next piece then I take the two

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.080 
the next piece then I take the two
pieces<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:34.000> roll<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.530> roll<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:36.160> together

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
pieces I roll and I roll one together

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:51.680 
pieces I roll and I roll one together
it's<00:02:37.810> becoming<00:02:38.200> mixed<00:02:38.860> up<00:02:39.100> already<00:02:39.310> okay

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650 

every<00:02:52.690> time<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:53.440> put<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.160> clay<00:02:54.640> back<00:02:55.239> in

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
every time I put the clay back in

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.559 
every time I put the clay back in
through<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.530> machine<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.250> fold<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.540> half

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
through the machine I fold it in half

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.039 
through the machine I fold it in half
and<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.799> put<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.310> through<00:03:00.580> with<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.180> full<00:03:01.569> side

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
and I put it through with the full side

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.270 
and I put it through with the full side
down<00:03:02.560> that's<00:03:03.519> because<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.269> want<00:03:04.450> any<00:03:04.780> air

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
down that's because I want any air

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.250 
down that's because I want any air
that's<00:03:06.280> between<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.060> two<00:03:07.299> layers<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:08.110> get

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
that's between the two layers to get

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.110 
that's between the two layers to get
pushed<00:03:08.590> up<00:03:10.170> okay<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.650> other<00:03:11.680> thing<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.549> if<00:03:12.819> you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
pushed up okay the other thing is if you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.990 
pushed up okay the other thing is if you
fold<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:13.959> half<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:15.160> could<00:03:15.340> put<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:15.819> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
fold it in half you could put it so the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.140 
fold it in half you could put it so the
fold<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:16.930> either<00:03:17.260> side<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:18.670> don't

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
fold is on either side you just don't

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.020 
fold is on either side you just don't
want<00:03:19.390> that<00:03:19.600> fold<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.560> top<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.859> what<00:03:24.609> winds

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
want that fold on the top and what winds

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.440 
want that fold on the top and what winds
up<00:03:25.150> happening<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.470> think<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.459> wind<00:03:28.269> up

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
up happening is I think that I wind up

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.380 
up happening is I think that I wind up
putting<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.959> through<00:03:29.549> maybe<00:03:30.549> twelve<00:03:31.090> or

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
putting it through maybe twelve or

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.140 
putting it through maybe twelve or
fourteen<00:03:31.900> times<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.890> clay<00:03:33.609> is<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.820> little

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
fourteen times if the clay is a little

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.900 
fourteen times if the clay is a little
harder<00:03:34.600> or<00:03:34.780> maybe<00:03:35.019> eight<00:03:35.769> or<00:03:35.799> ten<00:03:36.250> times<00:03:36.549> if

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
harder or maybe eight or ten times if

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.470 
harder or maybe eight or ten times if
the<00:03:37.030> clay<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.450> little<00:03:37.750> softer<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.269> just

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
the clay is a little softer and I just

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.920 
the clay is a little softer and I just
keep<00:03:40.720> putting<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.260> through<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.790> that's<00:03:43.450> it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
keep putting it through and that's it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.830 
keep putting it through and that's it
that's<00:03:44.440> how<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.650> conditioned<00:03:45.280> clay<00:03:45.600> try<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.660> at

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
that's how I conditioned clay try it at

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.819 
that's how I conditioned clay try it at
home<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.500> if<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.160> any<00:03:48.430> other<00:03:48.730> ideas
