play with these one cool thing you can
do<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.150> alternate<00:00:51.290> strings<00:00:52.290> so<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
do is alternate strings so what if I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.979 
do is alternate strings so what if I
play<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:54.540> low<00:00:54.809> string<00:00:55.200> at<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.470> seventh<00:00:55.770> fret

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
play the low string at the seventh fret
skip<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.140> string<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:58.680> move<00:00:58.830> to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.010> 12th<00:00:59.430> fret

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
play the 4th string I can do the same

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.179 

it<00:01:11.750> creates<00:01:12.079> a<00:01:12.170> very<00:01:12.970> harp-like<00:01:13.970> effect<00:01:15.040> if<00:01:16.040> I

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
it creates a very harp-like effect if I

it creates a very harp-like effect if I
play<00:01:16.399> those<00:01:16.579> together<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:17.299> get<00:01:17.600> this

if I play that all the way across the
neck<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.510> get<00:01:26.570> this

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.020 

it<00:01:33.840> sounds<00:01:34.049> pretty<00:01:34.140> cool<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:36.150> also<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:38.030> from

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it sounds pretty cool I can also go from

you also have these hidden positions you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.290 
you also have these hidden positions you

they're a little harder to squeeze out

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.700 
they're a little harder to squeeze out
but<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.400> get<00:02:10.490> some<00:02:10.670> cool<00:02:11.000> sounds<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:12.230> the

but you can get some cool sounds on the
third<00:02:12.920> fret

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.580 

here's<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> little<00:02:22.390> pattern<00:02:22.810> using<00:02:23.350> harmonics

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
here's a little pattern using harmonics

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:36.420 
here's a little pattern using harmonics

of the third fret fifth fret that's from

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.100 
of the third fret fifth fret that's from

positions<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.030> we've<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:43.660> looked<00:02:43.959> at<00:02:44.310> we

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
positions that we've just looked at we

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.240 
positions that we've just looked at we
can<00:02:45.550> go<00:02:46.090> above<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.720> twelfth<00:02:47.050> fret<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.470> we

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
can go above the twelfth fret and we

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.050 
can go above the twelfth fret and we
have<00:02:48.370> harmonics<00:02:48.910> here<00:02:49.420> at<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:50.430> 17th<00:02:51.430> fret<00:02:52.650> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
have harmonics here at the 17th fret a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.280 
have harmonics here at the 17th fret a
little<00:02:55.060> harder<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.420> squeeze<00:02:55.690> out<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.140> they're

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
little harder to squeeze out but they're

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.119 
little harder to squeeze out but they're
there<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.620> then<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> 19th<00:02:57.700> front

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:09.410 

those<00:03:01.969> are<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> same<00:03:02.450> as<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:02.870> seventh<00:03:03.200> fret

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.880 

so<00:03:10.420> as<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.570> can<00:03:10.690> see<00:03:10.750> harmonics<00:03:11.380> can<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.590> found

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
so as you can see harmonics can be found

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.150 
so as you can see harmonics can be found
all<00:03:12.160> over<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.460> neck<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:14.530> sure<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.830> have<00:03:14.950> some

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
all over the neck be sure to have some

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.890 
all over the neck be sure to have some
fun<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.520> them<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.730> check<00:03:16.420> out<00:03:16.540> some<00:03:16.570> of<00:03:16.750> the

fun with them and check out some of the
other<00:03:17.020> lessons<00:03:17.320> here<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.250> I've<00:03:18.550> done<00:03:18.730> on
