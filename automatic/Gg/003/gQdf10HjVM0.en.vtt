00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.850
 Acromegaly is a rare disease 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.360
 the pituitary gland 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.719
 19 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.719
 goes out 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.949
 Berlin comes from larger players 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.200
 For example, hands around feet as well 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.840
 To enlarge the facial features 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.140
 such as the lips of the nose 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.839
 or an enlargement of the tongue too 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.390
 internal organs such as the heart 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:37.730
 can get bigger here or the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.230
 Thyroid gland to a node growth 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.140
 or lead to an enlargement 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.510
 cause for these clinical symptoms 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.079
 is an increased production of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.699
 Growth hormones from a balloon 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.820
 in the 99 benign enlargement of a tumor 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.100
 all now the pituitary gland, the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.280
 growth hormone causes that in the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.170
 liver is increased and igf1 is formed 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.009
 both together to the clinical 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 Symptoms of acromegaly lead 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.100
 Patients suffering from acromegaly 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.479
 mostly treated by endocrinologists 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.090
 Being diagnosed often passes away 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.390
 years so it can happen that the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.819
 pine, the teeth also increases 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.190
 fail or the patient snore 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.739
 The sleep apnea syndrome is here 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.090
 quite typical characteristic of 

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:37.910
 an acromegaly that everyone can now 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.190
 by a magnetic resonance tomography mrt 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.330
 investigation of here in others 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.009
 crisis regions 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.649
 acromegaly is treated primarily 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.539
 through an operation by a 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.569
 Neurosurgeons here you go 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.610
 preferably through the nose in the 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.280
 area of ​​the pituitary gland around this 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.250
 to remove the album microsurgically 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.759
 In addition, drug therapy has 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.310
 also the advantage in addition to the lowering of 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.649
 Growth hormone also mirrors that athens 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.599
 without shrinking 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.700
 concern other treatment options 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.970
 also the daily injection with one 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.900
 very potent drug as well 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.360
 Mild form a tablets therapy 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.819
 thus it is necessary to have patients with 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.910
 of an acromegaly regarding her 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.959
 Hormone release in terms of their 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.470
 genome and the consequent disease around 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.310
 to capture symptoms in the body and to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
 investigate 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 this includes a cardiological 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.260
 investigation as well as an investigation 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.440
 of the tree and the intestine 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.480
 acromegaly is treated by 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.230
 endocrinologists in close cooperation with 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.230
 new swing
