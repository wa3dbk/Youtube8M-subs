00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 of business and a circumstance that 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.440
 is becoming more frequent by a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 call for savings in companies 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 lived a situation like that or you're about 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.369
 to live it and although you do not believe it 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.680
 you must also take care of your image 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.860
 night business so to speak for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 so let's start feel comfortable feel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.670
 comfortable with the clothes you wear for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.860
 that business trip invests in a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.600
 very good trip call you're 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 It will always remain in good condition and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.560
 It will be very easy to identify the care 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.630
 that all your clothes are in perfect 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.210
 maintenance would be very embarrassing that 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.460
 they will find some hole or some thread 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.230
 frayed in pajamas and that your company 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.330
 of work will guide you pieces 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.270
 fundamental for your night image 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.060
 business that would be a pair of pajamas 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.939
 pieces can be quite comfortable some 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.979
 slippers are essential one more is what 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890
 ideal but good if you feel comfortable 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.140
 with the two perfect pieces 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.330
 fundamental holidays for your image 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.240
 nightly business, the ideal 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.490
 have a pair of pajamas which is 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.860
 in good reason then that if you 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.810
 you move a lot when you sleep you can be 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.720
 showing a lot of skin and your underwear 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.930
 It is always comfortable with two pieces one 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.880
 Bata is a good suggestion because if 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.500
 you have was a good service is what 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.170
 you tapes with the towel can be 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.720
 slightly uncomfortable also buy at 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.430
 have some slippers is also comfortable 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.800
 because you can feel more secure at 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.450
 be treading on any surface with 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.149
 the one who calls with many transparencies 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.660
 It can also be uncomfortable, I suggest you 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.970
 whether they are solid or smooth colors 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.130
 to bring an extra change of clothes 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.649
 interior for every night that you stay 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.539
 so you arrive late in the evening but 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.149
 makes a shower and you put back 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.300
 your pajamas this will not keep smells of 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.160
 all day and you go to sleep very cool 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.930
 you are in a small place and you are 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.600
 sharing with another person who has 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.390
 customs different from you the perfect 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.460
 will be discreet comfortable and lots 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.350
 cleanliness i am that only stops the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.010
 next remember that your image is the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.010
 better investment
