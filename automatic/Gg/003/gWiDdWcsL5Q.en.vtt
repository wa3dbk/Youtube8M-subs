peers<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:43.440> guess<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.579> check<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> think

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.310 

even<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.660> brand<00:00:51.960> new<00:00:52.140> Norland<00:00:56.780> now<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.050> time

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
even a brand new Norland now it's time

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.820 
even a brand new Norland now it's time
for<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.680> cuttin<00:01:01.940> always<00:01:02.940> cut<00:01:03.210> stuff<00:01:05.240> okay<00:01:06.240> so

for the cuttin always cut stuff okay so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
for the cuttin always cut stuff okay so
basically<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
basically is this I think this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740 
basically is this I think this
