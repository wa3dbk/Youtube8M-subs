00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 there are very good toxic people welcome to a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 new video and we're in minecraft 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.280
 demos 360 with a new video tutorial 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 that today I bring you and this is something very 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.710
 curious also and that is that I will teach you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.990
 how to customize your own portal in your 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.390
 minecraft console or pc 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.240
 what we are going to need first is a 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.560
 Portal I'll put this so let's 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.300
 make a small portal 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.470
 network here here here here and we 're going to 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.350
 close very well we turn it on 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.260
 and the trick is going to be this is a bug if it's 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.920
 a bug but the truth is quite 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.410
 curious the one thing that I have left to 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.080
 create is that this is simply going to be 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.060
 as decoration they will not be able to cross the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.170
 portal or nothing is simply decoration 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.820
 it's a warning and well let's start like 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.440
 come here let's enter the world 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 We have already created a portal 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.940
 here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.119
 so let's do this 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.540
 from the normal world to the moment 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.300
 let's go to the portal we go to 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.290
 break a block like that look 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.690
 ok h here we provided here I've 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.610
 stuck let's break a block 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.610
 as you saw there I have broken one 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.360
 and so on until the portal is bustling 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.790
 as you see here we are still overwhelmed 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.180
 now let's break another 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.550
 is already supported but in case the flies 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.920
 I'm going to try another 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 another is valid if you are already a lawyer 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.830
 and so and can use any block 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.750
 as to replace it to see for example 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.300
 I do not know diamond 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880
 so that it looks decorative in their houses 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.200
 so that your friends are surprised say 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.829
 how did you do that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.369
 we will assist replace this and to 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.369
 that gives its own portal 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.330
 neither is this very good this 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 trick and just to eliminate that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 searched portal have to take a cube 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.630
 of water 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.790
 and just put them 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.640
 very well as they come there has broken the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.750
 portal and another has opened 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.630
 that this portal that is going to return to 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.819
 open is because they had a bullard like that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.530
 which is as if they did not have any and 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.310
 as there was already one in the lower world 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.730
 there had to be another one had to open 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.620
 another and here we have this portal but I 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.040
 I 'm going to destroy it because I do not like it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.450
 have two that look this and good guys 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.010
