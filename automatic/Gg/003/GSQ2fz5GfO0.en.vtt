00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.370
 left 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.890
 question of questioning 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.890
 Well, first of all, there is a short musical time 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.790
 cf. 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.010
 it is he who decides the stone we see playing this or that margin 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 and about 35 to 40 dead 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.120
 there was a large wound 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.530
 and to death for murder at times and other NATO countries 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.560
 another responsible on the board the plane b is known 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.600
 he was not weakening 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.730
 some brains the monument of Carmelites 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.340
 Farmers

 today my door 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.810
 addressing exploits for withdrawal 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.159
 so also unstable a distinctive sign for the drum major 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.300
 you have lost it 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.770
 you have the alarm clock 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.240
 265 depends on the weather for me I love 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 for the congo makes this choice 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990
 often 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.650
 to say otherwise as being in the 39 year old that I fight against his 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.189
 tampon underwear 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.650
 during two sets 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.250
 all following the budget 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 a walk 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.050
 for as many movements for my part I return from Moscow not enough for 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.709
 as many games as there can be of his accounts at July 30th these are the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.649
 end ancestors 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.009
 who to believe dr 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.939
 9 the traditional way will take time a lot of these flows of 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.059
 data found an old saying why fraser 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.129
 provided whistler 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.599
 after the murder 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.539
 I asked them to accept you as 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.269
 as a student I sell in a course of 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.949
 tango classes 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.949
 with the help of the students who are tearing them apart 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.029
 from 730 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.299
 for me it is always necessary 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.299
 two seasons because I do not have to complain well defined 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.959
 gold after two years of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.269
 several trained European diplomats 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.159
 they have a learning on the job as at worst 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.159
 I had gotten some sheet music to get ready at the fif 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.919
 % I repeaters 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.079
 he sole 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.759
 as I could 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.629
 from time to time I have found a hundred of those who are preparing mercier 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:09.349
 water 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.269
 and I wanted to show 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.939
 progress while I was very happy with my work I do not think I 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.239
 will study all 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.559
 all the directory that presence partition 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.909
 the youngest ones 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.209
 he played a mayor for whom you correct 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.859
 himself lamented 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:27.740
 it's good 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.969
 the melody is there 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.199
 but threshold 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.419
 everything must be a higher place 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.519
 but this change fundamentally gives it because it was necessary to take everything back 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.909
 others wear a lot more hours 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.589
 much more strength in the face of prayer 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.169
 find out later 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.849
 a lot of time 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.269
 the second particularity of taking the first one so it's that we play 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.429
 always word of mouth 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.499
 and the second which is the instrument 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.499
 why the instrument because we are the only one currently in belgium 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.499
 the days I think we're here only in clean sport 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.699
 pigeon always on ebay for a huge 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.609
 but many now the yellows are posing synthetic 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.999
 take the case of binoculars 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.119
 the games arises this summer 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.119
 to knot in the other without brimming hesme will always play 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:15.829
 especially animal skins 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.829
 and that's a problem was wearing mourning for 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.289
 find animal skins now 10 we can not find any 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.689
 but is broke 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.689
 if we played his departure this summer again 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.479
 he is one of the last 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.439
 the company orders this from us 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.479
 we will hear fc bienne 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.300
 it is by playing this morning as always they have now made me able to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.099
 marry 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.599
 when we make music it's a bit early and like the fact that you 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:46.840
 believe 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.850
 because if we do not do better up however need 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.370
 and because the last walkers 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.470
 he will ask to hear the drum as the first row 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.069
 by their behavior 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.509
 are we obliged to go a little better 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.870
 double reach at the same price as a reach at times 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.050
 formerly the batteries were very 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.599
 very start I was happy to see four drums a single title 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.809
 Why 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.550
 for a complete walk for a complete campaign 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.680
 now the the of the trend is rather to see two figures for 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.839
 and to their leader the best is that the two figures 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.759
 joumblatt 2010 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.219
 pastore 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.120
 we always learn with the same people who know the good 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.920
 according to the regions according to the times the melodies exchanges welcome 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.850
 different ways to play and if everyone plays a little bit 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.300
 in its way the result 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.979
 stay together 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.110
 but not very 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.539
 but not very harmonious 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.740
 so when we play two 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.419
 I think we have to go back to 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.389
 in a simple way to play 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.789
 the pusher 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.180
 play the same melody and that 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.430
 that the listener is not shocked when I speak of my first in worse 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.389
 it takes 40 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.389
 and there are about 200 two hundred and twenty pieces 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.110
 but we would have played more closely here 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.400
 opel mulcair 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.620
 why the others well because you know if I have to speak first 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.620
 recalled to the stands and that polio developing not easy every day 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.169
 and again yes they never have a lot of pieces ever been edited 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.599
 these are more his fight to recover left to right 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.939
 our comoros thoughts 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.279
 like everywhere 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.559
 the better you have to play these docks will not play 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.650
 and it was folded 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.999
 for example 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:47.899
 when we first play fast people hear about the first empire 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:50.889
 not to mention marc angrand 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.339
 so for me and for my apple 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.809
 in my job and that the country 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:59.809
 to say that these sticky songs fine forest tournaisis 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:01.919
 I can give you some 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.189
 about thirty to the nearest 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:06.649
 it seems to me very misogynous same year 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.439
 we are between us 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.839
 we like it 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:14.809
 and percent 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:19.649
 in my opinion it being in themselves gregory proment who creates 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:25.189
 an ambience of the atmosphere that reigns elsewhere this one had said he 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:26.430
 better to let off steam 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.660
 maybe that's the ultimate level no I do not give price 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.589
 a bubble the real estate a lines of 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.080
 a pound 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.979
 2
