work laptop anyway as you may recall
from<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.210> unboxing<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.340> ordered<00:00:29.340> an<00:00:29.900> optical

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
from the unboxing I ordered an optical

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.540 
from the unboxing I ordered an optical
drive<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.439> thing<00:00:32.420> you<00:00:33.530> know<00:00:34.550> lenovo

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
drive with this thing you know lenovo

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
drive with this thing you know lenovo
will<00:00:35.790> tell<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> reason

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
will tell you that you know the reason

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.799 
will tell you that you know the reason
why<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.430> guy<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.120> thin<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> begin

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
why this this guy is so thin to begin

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
why this this guy is so thin to begin
with<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:40.980> no<00:00:41.129> optical<00:00:41.610> drive

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
with is there was no optical drive

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
with is there was no optical drive
installed<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> um<00:00:44.300> yeah<00:00:45.300> maybe<00:00:45.980> but<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
installed in it um yeah maybe but in the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.740 
installed in it um yeah maybe but in the
previous<00:00:47.640> video<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.149> i<00:00:48.210> showed<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
previous video when i showed you the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.310 
previous video when i showed you the
asus<00:00:49.170> laptop<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:50.610> certainly<00:00:51.539> wasn't<00:00:51.899> much

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
asus laptop it certainly wasn't much

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.209 
asus laptop it certainly wasn't much
more<00:00:53.300> it's<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.539> weird<00:00:54.719> thick<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.039> one

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
more it's very weird thick that this one

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.479 
more it's very weird thick that this one
was<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.680> certainly<00:00:59.219> got<00:00:59.370> an

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
was or is and it's certainly got an

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.110 
was or is and it's certainly got an
optical<00:00:59.820> drive<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:01.460> may<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.520> hard<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> tell

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
optical drive in it may be hard to tell

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.140 
optical drive in it may be hard to tell
but<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> guy<00:01:04.680> does<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.100> an<00:01:05.250> internal

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
but this guy does have an internal

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.289 
but this guy does have an internal
optical<00:01:06.570> drive<00:01:06.810> that's<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.439> there<00:01:08.299> for

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
optical drive that's right there for

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.590 
optical drive that's right there for
those<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.159> order<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.900> from<00:01:12.900> the

to<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.140> an<00:01:22.320> optical<00:01:22.979> drive<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.979> when

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to get an optical drive with this when

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
to get an optical drive with this when
you<00:01:26.070> order<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.549> Y<00:01:26.729> 50<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.439> said

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
over to manufacturing and then they

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
over to manufacturing and then they
basically<00:02:04.500> ship<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:06.509> said

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
before all in all I think that took

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.340 
before all in all I think that took
month<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.630> needless<00:02:10.900> to<00:02:10.930> say<00:02:11.200> i've<00:02:11.320> been

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
month so needless to say i've been

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.560 
month so needless to say i've been
waiting<00:02:11.800> for<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> while<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.340> get<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:12.640> guy<00:02:12.820> in<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
waiting for a while to get this guy in I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.780 
waiting for a while to get this guy in I
will<00:02:16.570> be<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> first<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.230> admit<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:18.760> i

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
will be the first to admit that when i

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.280 
will be the first to admit that when i
ordered<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.690> with<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:22.740> optical<00:02:23.740> drive<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.730> i

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
ordered this with a optical drive that i

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.270 
ordered this with a optical drive that i
really<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.530> kind<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.770> under<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:26.980> impression

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
really was kind of under the impression

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.580 
really was kind of under the impression
that<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.670> might<00:02:27.820> be<00:02:27.850> an<00:02:28.090> internal<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.720> i'm

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that it might be an internal but i'm

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.300 
that it might be an internal but i'm
happy<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.760> not<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:35.680> i<00:02:36.010> was

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
happy to see that it's not because i was

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.910 
happy to see that it's not because i was
really<00:02:36.760> really<00:02:37.090> worried<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.650> wouldn't

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
really really worried that I wouldn't

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.470 
really really worried that I wouldn't
get<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:40.620> thinness<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.270> laptop<00:02:43.270> that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
get the thinness of the laptop that

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.120 
get the thinness of the laptop that
everybody<00:02:43.810> seems<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.260> love<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.890> much<00:02:45.070> about

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
everybody seems to love so much about

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.750 
everybody seems to love so much about
this<00:02:45.780> why<00:02:46.780> 50<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.370> thought<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.640> would<00:02:48.700> be

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
this why 50 I thought that it would be

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.940 
this why 50 I thought that it would be
more<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.300> big<00:02:49.570> thick<00:02:49.960> hog<00:02:50.200> like<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.710> and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
more like a big thick hog like this and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.520 
more like a big thick hog like this and
so<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.490> course<00:02:51.630> after<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.660> word<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:52.960> optical

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
so of course after I word that optical

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.630 
so of course after I word that optical
drive<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.830> had<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.980> little<00:02:54.130> bit<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.370> buyer's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640

remorse<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:56.370> wishing<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.460> could<00:02:57.520> go<00:02:57.760> back<00:02:57.910> and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
remorse and wishing I could go back and

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
maybe let's just be a different ok I see

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.270 
maybe let's just be a different ok I see
so<00:03:37.840> more<00:03:38.290> or<00:03:38.380> less<00:03:38.500> USB<00:03:38.980> cord<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:41.280> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
so more or less USB cord and then this

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.390 
so more or less USB cord and then this
here<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.940> actually<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.890> optical<00:03:45.250> drive<00:03:47.400> again

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
here is actually the optical drive again

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.990 
here is actually the optical drive again
not<00:03:48.670> plugged<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:50.220> I'm<00:03:51.220> assuming<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.850> when

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
not plugged in I'm assuming that when

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.210 
not plugged in I'm assuming that when
it's<00:03:52.120> on<00:03:52.300> yeah<00:03:53.050> base<00:03:53.410> by<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.620> symbol<00:03:53.950> there

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
it's on yeah base by the symbol there

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.140 
it's on yeah base by the symbol there
now<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.850> it's<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.090> focus<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.640> red<00:03:57.790> button

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
now that it's in focus the red button

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.510 
now that it's in focus the red button
obviously<00:03:59.140> just<00:03:59.410> kind<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.770> opens<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.310> closes

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
obviously just kind of opens and closes

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.710 
obviously just kind of opens and closes
the<00:04:00.760> CD<00:04:01.150> tray<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:03.670> guy<00:04:03.850> plugs<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.420> just<00:04:04.630> like

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the CD tray this guy plugs in just like

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.400 
the CD tray this guy plugs in just like
this<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.820> mini<00:04:07.000> USB<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.540> believe<00:04:07.959> on<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.170> back

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
this the mini USB I believe on the back

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.600 
this the mini USB I believe on the back
um<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:10.330> I<00:04:10.510> don't<00:04:10.720> know<00:04:10.780> handy<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.440> guess<00:04:11.770> maybe<00:04:12.459> I

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
um so I don't know handy I guess maybe I

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.100 
um so I don't know handy I guess maybe I
could<00:04:12.820> use<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:13.180> other<00:04:13.360> laptops<00:04:13.870> in<00:04:14.050> the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
could use it on other laptops in the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.430 
could use it on other laptops in the
future<00:04:14.970> just<00:04:15.970> kind<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.209> have<00:04:16.359> an<00:04:16.510> external<00:04:16.840> blu

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
future just kind of have an external blu
