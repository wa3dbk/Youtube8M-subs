00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.340
 they knew all people is xenon 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.080
 I hope you are well 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.970
 today we find ourselves on the chain 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.000
 of orange lanaye for a new 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.860
 gameplay so 1,131 of ratio to the scara 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.020
 silent cross on the turbines map 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.480
 in domination for this gameplay I was 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.640
 solo so I'll talk to you about it 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.450
 quickly before moving on to what I 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.250
 want to tell you today 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.870
 so at the level of assets already 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.570
 bulletproof vest determination 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.310
 dexterity and looters learns secondary 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.750
 it seems to me that I had a cac 40 is 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.520
 so four mortals 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.260
 and here I think you know little 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.760
 close all on my class so now 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 I will introduce myself a little so me 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.280
 it's xenon orange lanaye members 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.320
 recently in the roster ps3 I 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.820
 were part of the future ex queer so 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.210
 in fact I have I arrived with the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.850
 fusion 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.560
 and I make videos on youtube 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.630
 so what makes sense since I 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.460
 I'm here so I ask more than 100 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.320
 that he has nuclear every day 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.090
 my particularity is that I post a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.039
 commentary every day so that you 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.840
 always have new content to 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.399
 look and you do not get bored 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.810
 on youtube so here I hope it 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.549
 you will like it and I hope that this little 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.170
 video you will like anyway I'm doing 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.399
 all for 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.649
 after at the knit thighs if 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.259
 I forgot to tell you that so the star 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.520
 adaf fighting and hunting group it's 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.590
 really the best who strict on 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 this map the fight daf is enough 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.289
 random 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 since if there are people who 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.229
 inspire the districts to do as many 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.060
 the other star and hot enough to fart 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.100
 especially if the guy who is dense and well 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.799
 manage as much the daf it's really enough 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.119
 easy and that's saying it all if you 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.859
 manage not to make you fart 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.170
 really do a fucking carnage do not 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.490
 place with the case it seems to me and if 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.869
 you make fart maes is worried 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.039
 strict sar can nothing and in these cases there 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.450
 better to play the escort drone 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.130
 luckily this time I had some 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.029
 luck 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.289
 unfortunately down when you go out 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.359
 killstreaks like that especially on a 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.130
 map as open as the enemy drones 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.479
 can no longer capture flags and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.800
 that's why the game is going to end 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.690
 very early it's a bit of the vagaries of 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.820
 to play solo we can not really 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.830
 controlled the part is so I think 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.560
 that I could have done 1,200 kg 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 on this part if I had maybe a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.960
 little better play if I put not done 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.270
 kill a good one you'll see I'm going 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.040
 to die close to strict miki by a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.270
 guy who goes more or less one shot on 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 lagoon end it's going to be pretty tricky 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.840
 chelou a little as usual on this 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.100
 game and that's it I think I would have 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.960
 maybe more while 200 than he if 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.420
 I had been to nine but hey we will not be 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.350
 complain so what else is that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480
 I would like to talk to you a little bit 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.680
 today well I 'm going to talk to you about 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.060
 advice that I could give you 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.800
 to make beams sense it being 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.420
 given that the video does not last super 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 a long time and then I know that it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.480
 could interest most people 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.680
 who come to see us slaughter because 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.960
 that it's still to look at 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.010
 videos on youtube but I know by 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.880
 example when I watch videos from 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.050
 the hem of the clans I say fucking 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.980
 I should try to do that 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.960
 how are they doing and where 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.550
 I analyze their videos a bit for 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.110
 copy a bit of their play style their 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.310
 moves and everything so I'm going 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.230
 try to give you a little bit 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.020
 tips to succeed your first few more 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.460
 of percentile then already if there is a council 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.500
 primordial that I can give it to you and 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.270
 even though I can even forgive you 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.860
 if it does not seem to be extremely 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.140
 important like that is to play with 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.090
 determination determination that allows 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010
 to remove 20% of the points needed to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.360
 getting strict loops and I can 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.160
 make sure that to make more of 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.840
 percentile you will really need it I 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.430
 do not say it's essential but 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.350
 it's really great to have this asset 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.060
 there it allows to have sequestered a lot 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.800
 faster for example a lot of stars at 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.420
 instead of costing you 1500 points do you 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.120
 will cost that 1200 the orbital station 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.650
 will go under 1000 points and it can 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.850
 to be a big advantage to make 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.110
 districts faster and so do 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.220
 a lot of teams because black ops 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.160
 is a game that is still very 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 oriented killstreaks so you of any 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.410
 way you will need your 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.540
 strict to make blood shots 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.670
 that he took a second piece of advice that I 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.860
 can you give is to start well 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.239
 the game and especially to play the catches 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.160
 who dope the catches who you know what 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.750
 it's when you make kills in 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.550
 being on the flac for example by going 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.650
 on b and trying to kill the maximum 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.239
 of people staying in the area of ​​the flac 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.910
 it allows you to earn 200 points for 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.769
 every one he plus the capture of the flac if 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.450
 you get to stay until the end and 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.459
 I have not done VSAT 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.440
 like that just by going on b you have 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.360
 the microstation of the beginnings the party and 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.370
 it's immediately off 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.510
 it's easier to get in 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.800
 in the game and in these cases you 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.450
 are almost sure to have you 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.519
 everything felt the press had taken steps 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.930
 take too much risk of managing well 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.320
 your game besides speaking about 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.970
 risks 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.260
 do not hesitate to procrastinate when you 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.230
 come close to vaux who strictly 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.150
 even to camp do not be embarrassed to do 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.280
 that anyway it's important to 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.690
 know soon paurise and to do 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.130
 more than feel my opinion you have to know 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.570
 well rock and soon paurise and 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.730
 especially handle these two styles of play 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.960
 are getting tangled up brushes and without 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.460
 to make shit because someone 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.970
 who will be too eager to go 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.830
 strict docks 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.570
 in general he's going to want to rock like a 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.840
 pork and get killed too easily 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.190
 so here it is not super top after these 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.200
 put my main tips 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.290
 if I have some other advice to you 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.760
 to give frankly before I was the 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.020
 kind of guy who uses everything in ghost 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.310
 I removed since I do not find that this 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.590
 be really useful since the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.690
 machine nerve the drone and that he put to 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.400
 many more points I do not find 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.340
 whether it is no longer necessary to 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.390
 play drouot ghost forgiveness blow 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.160
 I put on bulletproof vest and that 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.860
 allows to dodge the beti xetra without 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.070
 have to remove dexterity for m 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.310
 engineer and it's really a benefit 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.080
 huge 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.729
 so here I think I would like 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.010
 give just about the most tips 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.479
 important that I had for you for the 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.650
 making your first more than 100 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.050
 kg in any case I hope they will have 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.229
 more I also hope that this little 131 of 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.580
 alaska rage ratio will have pleased you and me 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.500
 as the gameplay will soon be getting 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.060
 finish well I tell you to everything from 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.620
 next on my channel if you want to come

 stay on the orange line money is 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.020
 also very well posed on this so 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.150
 I hope you enjoy the gameplay 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.650
