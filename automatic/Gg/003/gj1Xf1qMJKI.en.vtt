you<00:00:35.370> guys<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.940> see<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> quick

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you guys are about to see is a quick

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840 
you guys are about to see is a quick
coin<00:00:37.469> test<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> shows<00:00:38.670> how

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
coin test that I like to do it shows how

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
coin test that I like to do it shows how
pliable<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.600> rubber<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.020> or<00:00:40.200> how<00:00:40.290> soft<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
pliable the rubber is or how soft it is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.459 
pliable the rubber is or how soft it is
and<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:42.210> softer<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.020> better<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and the softer it is the better it is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
and the softer it is the better it is
for<00:00:43.530> indoors<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.550> now<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
for indoors like right now you see that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060 
for indoors like right now you see that
the<00:00:45.690> rubber<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> bottom<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> metal<00:00:46.980> um

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the rubber on the bottom of the metal um

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
the rubber on the bottom of the metal um
no<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.550> coming<00:00:47.910> back<00:00:48.149> Allah<00:00:48.450> bending<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> lot

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
no it's coming back Allah bending a lot

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
no it's coming back Allah bending a lot
so<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> better<00:00:50.399> performer

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
so it's going to be a better performer

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
so it's going to be a better performer
indoors<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.620> softer<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.370> it's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
indoors because it's softer so it's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
indoors because it's softer so it's
going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> wear<00:00:53.969> down<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.480> easier<00:00:54.840> outdoors

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
going to wear down a lot easier outdoors

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
going to wear down a lot easier outdoors
like<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.250> example<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.879> right<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.210> I'm

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
like for example you see right now I'm

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.529 
like for example you see right now I'm
kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> slipping<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> lot<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.359> it's<00:01:00.359> not

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
kind of slipping a lot because it's not

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.970 
kind of slipping a lot because it's not
made<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.870> outdoors<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.440> said<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
made for outdoors like I said and it's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.619 
made for outdoors like I said and it's
really<00:01:02.129> soft<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.969> doesn't<00:01:03.180> stick<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
really soft and it just doesn't stick to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
really soft and it just doesn't stick to
the<00:01:03.660> pavement<00:01:03.930> well<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.470> here's<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> corn

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the pavement well and here's the corn

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
the pavement well and here's the corn
test<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> did<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> Jordan<00:01:06.869> beemo

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
test that I did to the Jordan beemo

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
test that I did to the Jordan beemo
which<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> made<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.369> outdoors<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> can

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
which is made for outdoors and you can

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630 
which is made for outdoors and you can
see<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> rubber<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.500> barely<00:01:10.860> moving<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.460> all

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
see the rubber is barely moving at all

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
see the rubber is barely moving at all
and<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.960> gonna<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.170> better<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.530> outdoors

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and this is gonna be better for outdoors

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.580 
and this is gonna be better for outdoors
because<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.810> harder<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> it'll<00:01:16.320> stick<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because it's harder and it'll stick to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
because it's harder and it'll stick to
the<00:01:16.740> pavement<00:01:16.979> better<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.270> some

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the pavement better this will have some

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
the pavement better this will have some
slippage<00:01:18.960> either<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> used<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
slippage either way like when I used to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.149 
slippage either way like when I used to
only<00:01:20.580> slip<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:22.229> harder<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.770> pretty

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
only slip but the harder it is pretty

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.230 
only slip but the harder it is pretty
much<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.580> better<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> be

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
much the better it's going to be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.300 
much the better it's going to be
outdoors<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.740> indicator<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
outdoors so that's a good indicator I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.840 
outdoors so that's a good indicator I
just<00:01:26.670> use<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> coin

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.180 

alright<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.050> next<00:01:31.200> category<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> go

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
alright so next category I'm going to go

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.700 
alright so next category I'm going to go
with<00:01:32.370> is<00:01:32.640> breathability<00:01:33.510> or<00:01:34.020> ventilation<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
with is breathability or ventilation in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.130 
with is breathability or ventilation in
the<00:01:34.740> shoe<00:01:35.010> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.120> same<00:01:36.330> Jordan<00:01:36.750> VMO

outdoors it's going to be hot so what
you<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.149> over<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.289> can<00:02:04.410> see<00:02:04.440> little

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you see over here is you can see little

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
you see over here is you can see little
vents<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.030> much<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> little

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
vents or there pretty much like a little

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
vents or there pretty much like a little
little<00:02:07.050> holes<00:02:07.259> covered<00:02:07.830> by<00:02:07.950> mesh<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.820> what

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
little holes covered by mesh and what

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.300 
little holes covered by mesh and what
this<00:02:09.119> does<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.600> allows<00:02:09.899> heat<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.709> when

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
this does is allows heat to get out when

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.070 
this does is allows heat to get out when
you<00:02:11.400> put<00:02:11.640> any<00:02:11.790> put<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.120> sweaty<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.660> gets<00:02:12.840> hot

you put any put that sweaty it gets hot

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380 
you put any put that sweaty it gets hot
and<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.920> allows<00:02:14.040> air<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.060> you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and it just allows air to get out you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.930 
and it just allows air to get out you
need<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.080> out<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.470> cage<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.790> also

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
need to get out of this cage and it also

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
need to get out of this cage and it also
allows<00:02:18.330> air<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> get<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.170> kind<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.530> cool<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
allows air to get in so kind of cool it

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.259 
allows air to get in so kind of cool it
down<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> little<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.030> wonderful

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
down a little because you know wonderful

down a little because you know wonderful
gets<00:02:21.570> hot<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:21.989> sweaty<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.709> starts

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
gets hot I get sweaty and it starts

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
gets hot I get sweaty and it starts
moving<00:02:23.160> around<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> shoe<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.630> lose

moving around in the shoe you lose
support<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.500> also<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.830> could<00:02:25.950> get<00:02:26.130> blisters

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
support and also you could get blisters

support and also you could get blisters
when<00:02:26.790> you're<00:02:26.940> playing<00:02:27.120> outside<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.019> don't

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
when you're playing outside and I don't

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
when you're playing outside and I don't
think<00:02:28.650> anybody<00:02:29.130> likes<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.580> all<00:02:30.510> right<00:02:30.630> guys

think anybody likes that all right guys
so<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.019> pretty<00:02:31.200> much<00:02:31.380> one<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.739> two<00:02:31.920> things

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so I pretty much one of the two things

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.590 
so I pretty much one of the two things
