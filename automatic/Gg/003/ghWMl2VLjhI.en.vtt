00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the stopping power but it seemed that it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.540 
the stopping power but it seemed that it
was<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> bit<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:24.090> accurate<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.840> usual<00:00:25.550> now

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550

lancer then you would remember that yet
to<00:00:30.420> make<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.750> accurate<00:00:30.990> you'd<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> burst

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to make it accurate you'd have to burst

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.360 
to make it accurate you'd have to burst
fire<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:34.440> i've<00:00:34.829> noticed<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
fire it and now i've noticed that you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.799 
fire it and now i've noticed that you
don't<00:00:35.550> even<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> burst<00:00:36.120> fire<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> make

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
it accurate all you have to do is just

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.880 
it accurate all you have to do is just
hold<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.270> thumbstick<00:00:39.570> down<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.230> combat
