00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.700
 you have to have guys welcome to this 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.190
 comparison video about the remakes 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.429
 pokemon blond mega sapphire alpha with 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.530
 pokemon rubí sapphire the game boy advance 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.600
 and then here we will be seeing the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.910
 trailers that have uploaded to the official channel 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.460
 of pokemon in japan 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.279
 and as I still not the best in what 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.310
 edited to be able to see it so I want 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.700
 to see the difference in the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.850
 animation of 2003 with the animation of 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.540
 this year 2014 has changed a lot in 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.790
 the 3ds and I love it 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 let's see what it shows us in 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.710
 now new here is the crisis route 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.300
 I do not remember what route is what number of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.790
 route is but it does not matter 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.950
 look here is it makes us remember that 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.629
 we could have a record 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.270
 I do not know if they saw the previous video of 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.970
 gay pokemon I did something similar with a 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.280
 record but skiing and it is in the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.590
 route 114 to look here is where they come from 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.600
 these meteor craters 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.600
 here we can see using the bike 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.030
 acrobatic water 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.659
 this is the route where you select the route 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.240
 119 if I'm not wrong and I'm doing 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.320
 it has improved enough look how it looks 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:29.080
 and wilber we can be on wilmer 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.080
 that's the place where the museum is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.409
 and I really like the song 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.409
 they have improved too much and they are a drive 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 well this route where appears the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.509
 lion kick that are hidden good not 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.079
 they are hidden but they are 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.120
 invisible 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.400
 here is the coccyx 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.400
 which makes it possible for us to see the cycles 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.140
 and then the battle against the 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.659
 cyclone that we see this is already very similar 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.780
 to xy 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.069
 to thousands on the first route 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 here the professor appears 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.500
 listen to emerald is a six but in 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.940
 reality in the anime and the ruby ​​sapphire is 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.270
 puig and full 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.150
 what is that help to the teacher then look 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.099
 here is choosing 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.470
 I think that the screen below shows 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.770
 something similar like the portfolio like that in the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.780
 teacher in the bag that has that 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:43.360
 and here is our rival friend yes I think 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.360
 which is the two aura may 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.070
 I love the ruby ​​sapphire background in the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.070
 that is all blue and red 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.140
 good guy hired the guy 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.140
 and now torch against motive 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.370
 everyone 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.370
 and finally motivate against trico 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.770
 level 6 come out there 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.860
 I really want to play and the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.400
 remakes missing very little and then now 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.450
 we see the magma team here the soundtrack 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.450
 also that has changed 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.690
 or I love I love it 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.920
 It is not great 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.920
 just listen 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.330
 Well, here it is maxi and file the two 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.880
 leaders of the evil teams 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.370
 as we already know, I think it's good if 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.410
 they have mega stones so they go to 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.310
 have a mega-served and a friend from Cameroon 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.710
 that monitor pax and what else follows 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.780
 Well here are the interviewers 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.569
 reporters who are through everything 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.219
 young 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.219
 look for your information about you 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.440

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.440
 first generation 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.220
 look how it comes out now it's much better 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.220
 there is more animation 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.540
 the medal comes out and floating good the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.960
 medal are not symbol sixto 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.330

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.560
 the one that no longer can not stand the desire to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.560
 play that play 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.500
 to see how the animation comes out 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.000
 well, it seems that only the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.310
 ruby sapphire animation yes that 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.620

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.270

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.340
