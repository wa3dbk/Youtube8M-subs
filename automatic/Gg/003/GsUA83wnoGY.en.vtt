take this long in art isn't ours it

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.969 
take this long in art isn't ours it
varies

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 

sometimes<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.509> starting<00:01:33.960> out

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
sometimes when that was starting out

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
sometimes when that was starting out
properly<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.979> operating<00:01:35.039> on<00:01:35.430> our<00:01:35.579> new

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
properly when I was operating on our new

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.789 
properly when I was operating on our new
starting<00:01:36.149> up<00:01:36.270> properly<00:01:36.689> could<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.380> anywhere

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
starting up properly could take anywhere

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.889 
starting up properly could take anywhere
from<00:01:37.860> 30<00:01:38.549> seconds<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.149> two<00:01:39.390> minutes

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
from 30 seconds to two minutes

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.590 
from 30 seconds to two minutes
really<00:01:43.729> which<00:01:44.729> might<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.119> part<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.539> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
really which might be part of the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
really which might be part of the
problem<00:01:45.929> too<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> should<00:01:47.250> be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
problem too you think it should be

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.469 
problem too you think it should be
consistent

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.910 

well<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.080> would<00:01:51.290> think<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.770> would<00:01:51.860> be

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
well I would think that it would be

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.590 
well I would think that it would be
doing<00:01:52.310> something<00:01:52.729> by<00:01:52.909> now<00:01:54.850> we<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:56.240> been

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
doing something by now we have been

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.929 
doing something by now we have been
going<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:56.990> almost<00:01:57.619> two<00:01:58.070> minutes<00:01:58.369> oh<00:01:58.400> okay<00:01:58.880> so

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
going for almost two minutes oh okay so

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.710 
going for almost two minutes oh okay so
oh<00:02:00.189> okay<00:02:01.189> I<00:02:01.369> think<00:02:01.610> hey<00:02:01.729> buddy<00:02:02.270> got<00:02:02.450> that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
oh okay I think hey buddy got that
