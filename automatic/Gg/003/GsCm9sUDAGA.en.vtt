 And that's it 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 again a beer more video over it 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.060
 Ohmann no special I played Floritz linguistic errors get the leaks I 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.820
 I've discovered a new species 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.699
 and I like the world to reappear in the block 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
 to be tracked regularly and everything 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.589
 Keep more stories but I have not had them to this extent before 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.930
 seen because of this and now this 9th 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.450
 Dedicate to Amons Art it is too german we can see the talk 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.350
 students 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.560
 more 2 percent 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.600
 16 and with the kill euro in the 2 the 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.630
 I'm not like that 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.210
 The bursae should have been expected 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.739
 being popular I am very relieved 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 just how it is meant to be 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.670
 Suffice a small point victory shipyard wage of the EKD first clarity let's see 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.030
 what happens if I'm the little Cain with that is really loud 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.150
 often works out 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.310
 which also awakens 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.450
 of t what is just a huge game a point 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.210
 Â«I was not 100 percent, it gets more difficult 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.490
 I've been told that the big beating suite can do that and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.150
 the small but not faster deleted 1 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.890
 and actually I thought that big star's become small state 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.580
 or when it comes into force 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.300
 hard I have to be careful that I borrow Rohwer now 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.270
 time to vote 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 Lord is just everywhere - Sokratis Corp. 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.549
 make the mucous membranes when they commit 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.650
 wa 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.649
 why we do the opposite you could say 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:15.369
 it is still unclear whether Papermaster still open the entrance fee 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.239
 but nothing is known yet 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.879
 45 percent could hit for income 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:32.919
 should be over 50 years you will be Colorful Clermont Foot are smart 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.889
 both pictures with hate now her art is gone 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.119
 people are drinking there 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.489
 For me, Ms. Kraft Fagan gives herself incapacity 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.760
 goutiert 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.090
 So 4 percent shipped to Belgium 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.519
 Marien, what will you let me guess? 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.239
 Ural 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.549
 so is already finished the man is at 11 percent 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.519
 Well now is settled 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.979
 Thomas the pig 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.819
 to test yourself 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.429
 St pits as if she had a poem and we could see 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.979
 what value does my iPad version have the moon probe they are packed and 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.489
 after devalued at one point and at market prices 2 who as 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.499
 Mediators wielded dapd tools from saboteurs then put Bamberger's victory 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.139
 percent 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.319
 yes, also Runkel 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.389
 what they are duty 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.379
 Yes 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.339
 as I said the new 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:50.189
 against Art that is the last implemented from there into 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.459
 least 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.580
 and that was 1 wanting international 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.060
 which is still somewhere around the subject though 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.039
 yes that should have been so much goal I hope that one again a small 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.529
 Insight comes 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.000
 and 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Of course, this also has the new updates and everything 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:15.910
 and yes I always wish you Euro in the previous year 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.879
 m his goal 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.879
 who his words 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.460
 I still wish you a lot of fun while attacking them 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.960
 you always do 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.449
 who pay attention 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.500
 that's the program the smartest sentence construction expects it would prefer 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:33.009
 break up
