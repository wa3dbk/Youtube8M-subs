00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.979
 organization to get this the machinery that is necessary for 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.969
 transform it because before it was not transformed people came to buy 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.810
 coffee now we do not have intermediaries 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.240

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 for this reason the group thinking of possession of 13 years commented 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.440

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.919
 and that is how we teach them how 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.919
 to ask ourselves we were all organized and everything 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.919

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.879
 work to decide who as always just that 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.559
 it is a sittuation 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.999
 to the needs of 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.370
 self-employment 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.009
