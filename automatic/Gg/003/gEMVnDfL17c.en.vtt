00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
active use from a single charge 264

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.370 
active use from a single charge 264
active<00:01:53.009> hours<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.420> you're<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.750> using<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
active hours and if you're not using it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.069 
active hours and if you're not using it
you<00:01:55.409> should<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.009> 40<00:01:56.490> 300<00:01:57.240> hours<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> standby

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you should get 40 300 hours of standby

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
you should get 40 300 hours of standby
time<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.540> actually<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> heavy

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
time so it is actually not a heavy

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.580 
time so it is actually not a heavy
keyboard<00:02:01.770> case<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.640> case<00:02:03.119> itself<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.899> less

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
keyboard case the case itself is less

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.940 
keyboard case the case itself is less
than<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.159> iPad<00:02:05.490> air<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.030> weight<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.799> got

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
than the iPad air in weight but it's got

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.169 
than the iPad air in weight but it's got
a<00:02:07.979> beefy<00:02:08.340> enough<00:02:08.369> battery<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.060> going

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a beefy enough battery that you're going

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
a beefy enough battery that you're going
to<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.330> 40<00:02:09.629> 300<00:02:10.050> hours<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> standby<00:02:10.709> time<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
to get 40 300 hours of standby time you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.650 
to get 40 300 hours of standby time you
will<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.989> Belkin

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
will get the little Belkin

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.410 
will get the little Belkin
the<00:02:14.440> little<00:02:14.650> Belkin<00:02:14.950> guy<00:02:15.070> right<00:02:15.310> here<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.910> as

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the little Belkin guy right here and as

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.240 
the little Belkin guy right here and as
I<00:02:16.540> said<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.110> really<00:02:17.440> nice<00:02:17.650> feeling<00:02:17.950> case

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
I said it's a really nice feeling case

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.880 
I said it's a really nice feeling case
it's<00:02:18.970> aluminum<00:02:19.630> which<00:02:19.900> gives<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.380> strength

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
it's aluminum which gives it strength

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.740 
it's aluminum which gives it strength
but<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.430> also<00:02:21.550> keeps<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.000> relatively<00:02:22.540> light

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
but it also keeps it relatively light

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.750 
but it also keeps it relatively light
and<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.470> does<00:02:23.590> feel<00:02:23.800> really<00:02:23.830> nice<00:02:24.190> in<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.730> hand

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and it does feel really nice in the hand

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.870 
and it does feel really nice in the hand
so<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.600> open<00:02:25.990> up<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.500> case<00:02:26.950> you'll<00:02:27.610> see

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
so if I open up the case you'll see

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.910 
so if I open up the case you'll see
here's<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.330> Belkin<00:02:28.810> website<00:02:29.290> you'll<00:02:29.830> see

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
here's the Belkin website you'll see

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
here's the Belkin website you'll see
that<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> iPad<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.820> held<00:02:31.030> inside<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.170> nice

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
that the iPad is held inside it's a nice

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.450 
that the iPad is held inside it's a nice
hard<00:02:34.780> plastic<00:02:34.870> shell<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.860> clicks<00:02:36.070> into

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
hard plastic shell that it clicks into

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.370 
hard plastic shell that it clicks into
gives<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.790> nice<00:02:36.940> protection<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:38.200> have

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
gives it nice protection and you have

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.570 
gives it nice protection and you have
the<00:02:38.500> keyboard<00:02:38.650> now<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> things<00:02:39.460> you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
the keyboard now one of the things you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.520 
the keyboard now one of the things you
make<00:02:39.820> immediately<00:02:40.480> notice<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.080> certainly

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
make immediately notice and I certainly

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.740 
make immediately notice and I certainly
did<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.370> goes<00:02:42.580> like<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.630> you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
did is that it goes like this so if you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.040 
did is that it goes like this so if you
open<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.140> up<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.410> way<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.830> iPad<00:02:45.190> actually

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
open it up this way the iPad actually

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.480 
open it up this way the iPad actually
holds<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.110> keyboard<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.530> way<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
holds the keyboard that way and if you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.740 
holds the keyboard that way and if you
open<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:48.970> way<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.180> better<00:02:49.480> hope<00:02:49.720> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
open up this way you better hope that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.600 
open up this way you better hope that
your<00:02:49.930> iPads<00:02:50.290> inside<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.250> gonna<00:02:51.400> go

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
your iPads inside because it's gonna go

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.940 
your iPads inside because it's gonna go
like<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.900> why<00:02:53.200> would<00:02:53.530> they<00:02:53.650> have<00:02:53.770> done

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
like that now why would they have done

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.440 
like that now why would they have done
that<00:02:54.100> well<00:02:54.310> it's<00:02:54.520> really<00:02:54.760> simple<00:02:55.120> there<00:02:55.330> are

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
that well it's really simple there are

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.510 
that well it's really simple there are
magnets<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.140> bottom<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.130> iPad

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
magnets on the bottom of the iPad

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.280 
magnets on the bottom of the iPad
section<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.180> they're<00:02:58.360> magnets<00:02:58.810> right<00:02:58.990> here

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
section and they're magnets right here

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.460 
section and they're magnets right here
so<00:02:59.830> that<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.130> can<00:03:00.280> actually<00:03:00.850> put<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> iPad<00:03:02.200> in

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
so that you can actually put the iPad in

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.380 
so that you can actually put the iPad in
one<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.800> three<00:03:03.040> different<00:03:03.160> viewing<00:03:03.940> angles

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
one of three different viewing angles

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.120 
one of three different viewing angles
it's<00:03:05.110> hard<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.380> do<00:03:05.470> when<00:03:05.590> I'm<00:03:05.680> holding<00:03:05.830> it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
it's hard to do when I'm holding it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.090 
it's hard to do when I'm holding it
that's<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:08.470> shallowest<00:03:10.800> that's<00:03:11.800> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
that's the shallowest that's the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.350 
that's the shallowest that's the
steepest<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.490> this<00:03:15.490> is<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> one<00:03:15.880> right<00:03:16.060> in

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
steepest and this is the one right in

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.160 
steepest and this is the one right in
the<00:03:16.630> middle

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
the middle

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.380 
the middle
now<00:03:17.530> how<00:03:17.800> strong<00:03:18.340> are<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.760> magnets<00:03:19.150> well

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
now how strong are the magnets well

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.670 
now how strong are the magnets well
they're<00:03:19.720> strong<00:03:19.900> enough<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.380> do<00:03:20.470> that

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
they're strong enough if I can do that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.980 
they're strong enough if I can do that
and<00:03:20.890> they're<00:03:21.580> also<00:03:21.850> strong<00:03:22.360> enough<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.960> I

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
and they're also strong enough that I

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.390 
and they're also strong enough that I
can<00:03:23.350> do<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.810> we'll<00:03:26.020> hold<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.410> iPad<00:03:26.530> nice

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
can do that so we'll hold the iPad nice

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.150 
can do that so we'll hold the iPad nice
and<00:03:27.610> stable<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.150> did<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.750> find<00:03:29.080> any<00:03:29.440> issue<00:03:29.740> with

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and stable I did not find any issue with

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270 
and stable I did not find any issue with
that<00:03:30.220> being<00:03:31.140> top-heavy<00:03:32.140> nor<00:03:33.010> did<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.250> have

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
that being top-heavy nor did I have

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.190 
that being top-heavy nor did I have
issues<00:03:33.640> with<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.840> magnets

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
issues with the with the magnets

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.380 
issues with the with the magnets
releasing<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.340> addition<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.090> can<00:03:37.240> actually

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
releasing in addition you can actually

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.890 
releasing in addition you can actually
fold<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.770> all<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.160> way<00:03:39.250> back<00:03:39.520> and<00:03:39.880> then<00:03:40.750> you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
fold this all the way back and then you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.330 
fold this all the way back and then you
can<00:03:41.050> actually<00:03:41.200> hold<00:03:41.560> your<00:03:41.770> iPad<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.280> way<00:03:42.930> and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
can actually hold your iPad this way and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.310 
can actually hold your iPad this way and
not<00:03:45.340> be<00:03:45.580> interrupting<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:46.750> interfering<00:03:47.290> with

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
not be interrupting and interfering with

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.840 
not be interrupting and interfering with
the<00:03:47.530> keys<00:03:47.740> which<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.190> wouldn't<00:03:48.400> want<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> be

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
the keys which I wouldn't want to be

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.580 
the keys which I wouldn't want to be
pressing<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.270> these<00:03:49.420> too<00:03:49.630> much<00:03:49.810> because<00:03:50.290> this

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
pressing on these too much because this

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.810 
pressing on these too much because this
is<00:03:50.740> obviously<00:03:51.100> going<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.370> be<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.640> most

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
is obviously going to be the most

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.630 
is obviously going to be the most
vulnerable<00:03:52.030> part<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.140> keyboard<00:03:53.800> case<00:03:54.100> so

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
vulnerable part of the keyboard case so

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.280 
vulnerable part of the keyboard case so
let's<00:03:54.820> talk<00:03:55.000> about<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.360> keyboard<00:03:55.720> itself<00:03:55.990> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
let's talk about the keyboard itself the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.930 
let's talk about the keyboard itself the
keyboard<00:03:56.650> actually<00:03:56.800> has<00:03:57.130> very<00:03:57.400> nice<00:03:57.580> keys<00:03:57.910> a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
keyboard actually has very nice keys a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.220 
keyboard actually has very nice keys a
nice<00:03:58.450> amount<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.780> play<00:03:59.020> in<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.620> keys<00:03:59.830> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
nice amount of play in the keys the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.720 
nice amount of play in the keys the
keyboard<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.320> nicely<00:04:02.740> laid<00:04:02.950> out<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.490> keys

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
keyboard is nicely laid out and the keys

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.980 
keyboard is nicely laid out and the keys
don't<00:04:03.970> feel<00:04:04.240> like<00:04:04.360> you're<00:04:04.510> using<00:04:04.690> this

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
don't feel like you're using this

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.620 
don't feel like you're using this
miniscule<00:04:05.410> little<00:04:05.950> keyboard<00:04:06.300> that's<00:04:07.300> been<00:04:07.510> my

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
miniscule little keyboard that's been my

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.100 
miniscule little keyboard that's been my
problem<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:08.140> any<00:04:08.410> case<00:04:09.040> or<00:04:09.400> keyboard<00:04:10.120> for

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
problem with any case or keyboard for

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.380 
problem with any case or keyboard for
the<00:04:11.170> iPad<00:04:11.320> Mini<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.760> no<00:04:12.910> matter<00:04:13.030> how<00:04:13.330> you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
the iPad Mini is that no matter how you

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.270 
the iPad Mini is that no matter how you
implement<00:04:14.050> it<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.350> keys<00:04:14.560> are<00:04:14.740> going<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.920> be<00:04:15.010> so

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
implement it the keys are going to be so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.620 
implement it the keys are going to be so
smushed<00:04:15.580> together<00:04:15.700> that's<00:04:16.060> not<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.480> case

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
smushed together that's not the case

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.010 
smushed together that's not the case
here<00:04:16.959> now<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.530> do<00:04:17.980> have<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.940> row<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.450> numbers<00:04:19.690> up

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
here now you do have a row of numbers up

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.110 
here now you do have a row of numbers up
top<00:04:20.200> but<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:20.530> do<00:04:20.680> not<00:04:20.830> have<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> specialty<00:04:21.820> row

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
top but you do not have a specialty row

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.540 
top but you do not have a specialty row
of<00:04:22.390> function<00:04:22.960> keys<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.620> way<00:04:23.770> we<00:04:23.919> have<00:04:24.040> seen<00:04:24.310> on

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
of function keys the way we have seen on

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.220 
of function keys the way we have seen on
some<00:04:24.580> other<00:04:24.850> keyboard<00:04:25.660> case

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
some other keyboard case

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.470 
some other keyboard case
those<00:04:27.230> function<00:04:27.740> keys<00:04:27.980> actually<00:04:28.550> are<00:04:28.790> doubled

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
those function keys actually are doubled

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.810 
those function keys actually are doubled
up<00:04:29.570> with<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.870> numbers<00:04:30.170> so<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.830> have<00:04:31.220> over

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
up with the numbers so you have over

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.370 
up with the numbers so you have over
here<00:04:32.030> you've<00:04:32.210> got<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.690> home<00:04:32.870> button<00:04:33.200> which

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
here you've got the home button which

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.100 
here you've got the home button which
actually<00:04:33.830> works<00:04:34.010> by<00:04:34.190> while<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.490> push<00:04:34.670> it<00:04:34.850> and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
actually works by while you push it and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.540 
actually works by while you push it and
it'll<00:04:36.110> take<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.410> home<00:04:36.590> if<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:37.220> push<00:04:37.400> it

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
it'll take you to home if you push it

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.060 
it'll take you to home if you push it
twice<00:04:37.790> it'll<00:04:38.240> activate<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.870> fast<00:04:39.830> app

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
twice it'll activate the fast app

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.710 
twice it'll activate the fast app
switching<00:04:40.580> which<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:40.970> really<00:04:41.270> nice<00:04:41.420> if<00:04:41.600> you're

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
switching which is really nice if you're

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.450 
switching which is really nice if you're
working<00:04:41.930> on<00:04:42.170> a<00:04:42.200> project<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:43.070> can<00:04:43.250> switch

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
working on a project you can switch

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.160 
working on a project you can switch
between<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:44.030> document<00:04:44.510> you're<00:04:44.600> writing<00:04:44.960> and

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
between the document you're writing and

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.360 
between the document you're writing and
the<00:04:45.320> website<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:45.890> may<00:04:46.010> be<00:04:46.070> getting

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
the website you may be getting

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.580 
the website you may be getting
information<00:04:46.490> from<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.840> quick<00:04:48.050> tap<00:04:48.260> move

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
information from just a quick tap move

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.310 
information from just a quick tap move
back<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:48.920> forth<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.480> love<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:50.750> aspect<00:04:50.930> of

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
back and forth I love that aspect of

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.040 
back and forth I love that aspect of
this<00:04:51.470> but<00:04:52.190> then<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.640> number<00:04:52.760> one<00:04:53.120> is<00:04:53.540> also<00:04:53.750> if

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
this but then the number one is also if

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.080 
this but then the number one is also if
you<00:04:54.170> do<00:04:54.320> shift<00:04:54.710> one<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.250> get<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.550> exclamation

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
you do shift one you get the exclamation

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.810 
you do shift one you get the exclamation
mark<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.450> if<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:56.990> do<00:04:57.110> function<00:04:57.710> one<00:04:57.920> you<00:04:58.580> get

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
mark and if you do function one you get

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.950 
mark and if you do function one you get
the<00:04:59.240> multiple<00:05:00.200> windows<00:05:00.410> like<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:01.960> that's

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
the multiple windows like this that's

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.320 
the multiple windows like this that's
the<00:05:03.170> fastest<00:05:03.500> with<00:05:03.680> app<00:05:03.920> switching<00:05:04.430> also<00:05:04.580> if

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
the fastest with app switching also if

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.730 
the fastest with app switching also if
you<00:05:05.480> want<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.720> bring<00:05:05.810> up<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.050> soft<00:05:06.290> keyboard

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
you want to bring up the soft keyboard

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.970 
you want to bring up the soft keyboard
it's<00:05:07.010> on<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.850> number<00:05:08.150> two<00:05:08.540> key<00:05:08.840> if<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.680> shift

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
it's on the number two key if the shift

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.310 
it's on the number two key if the shift
two<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.730> add<00:05:10.910> sign<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.660> function<00:05:12.110> two

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
two is the add sign and the function two

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.460 
two is the add sign and the function two
is<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.950> you're<00:05:16.250> writing<00:05:16.690> here<00:05:17.690> we<00:05:17.780> go<00:05:17.930> if

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
is if you're writing here we go if

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.610 
is if you're writing here we go if
you're<00:05:19.070> typing<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:20.480> keyboard<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.140> obviously

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
you're typing the keyboard and obviously

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.350 
you're typing the keyboard and obviously
it<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:22.100> context-aware

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
it is context-aware

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.450 
it is context-aware
so<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.050> won't<00:05:24.230> come<00:05:24.410> up<00:05:24.530> if<00:05:24.680> you<00:05:24.800> don't<00:05:25.250> have<00:05:25.400> a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
so it won't come up if you don't have a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.490 
so it won't come up if you don't have a
window<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:25.880> you<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.030> input<00:05:26.360> information

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
window that you can input information
