00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
is as you can see another mp5 style gun

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.430 
is as you can see another mp5 style gun
very<00:00:42.879> similar<00:00:43.479> it's<00:00:43.659> shorter<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.260> has<00:00:44.409> a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
very similar it's shorter it has a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.460 
very similar it's shorter it has a
shorter<00:00:45.010> front<00:00:45.610> section<00:00:46.120> both<00:00:46.960> of<00:00:47.170> these<00:00:47.260> are

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
shorter front section both of these are

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.469 
shorter front section both of these are
removable<00:00:47.800> by<00:00:48.159> the<00:00:48.220> way<00:00:48.460> they<00:00:48.640> do<00:00:48.699> remove<00:00:49.150> so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
removable by the way they do remove so

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.090 
removable by the way they do remove so
this<00:00:49.629> poor<00:00:49.870> grip<00:00:50.050> does<00:00:50.199> remove<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.739> imagine

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
this poor grip does remove and I imagine

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.290 
this poor grip does remove and I imagine
you<00:00:51.190> could<00:00:51.309> replace<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:51.699> with<00:00:51.940> something

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
you could replace it with something

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.460 
you could replace it with something
different<00:00:52.510> if<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:52.930> could<00:00:53.050> find<00:00:53.260> something

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
different if you could find something

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.869 
different if you could find something
that<00:00:53.620> fit<00:00:53.860> now<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.420> blowback<00:00:56.409> style<00:00:57.040> BB

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.640 
that fit now this is a blowback style BB
gun<00:00:58.059> but<00:00:58.269> it's<00:00:58.390> not<00:00:58.570> full<00:00:58.870> auto<00:00:59.049> it's<00:00:59.350> just

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
them have similar rails and you can put

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.050 
them have similar rails and you can put
the<00:02:04.420> same<00:02:04.570> type<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.990> rail<00:02:05.580> adapters<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.790> them

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the same type of rail adapters on them

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.520 
the same type of rail adapters on them
for<00:02:07.390> putting<00:02:07.810> different<00:02:08.019> scopes<00:02:08.440> or

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
for putting different scopes or

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.290 
for putting different scopes or
different<00:02:08.800> things<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.190> but<00:02:09.879> you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.090> see<00:02:10.209> that

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
different things on but you can see that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.720 
different things on but you can see that
they're<00:02:10.450> very<00:02:10.599> similar<00:02:10.989> guns<00:02:11.459> now<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.489> also

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
they're very similar guns now I also

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
they're very similar guns now I also
have<00:02:12.879> had<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> little<00:02:13.330> bit<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.569> an<00:02:13.659> opportunity

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
have had a little bit of an opportunity

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.479 
have had a little bit of an opportunity
to<00:02:14.290> play<00:02:14.500> around<00:02:14.739> with<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.010> gun<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> little

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to play around with this gun a little

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.009 
to play around with this gun a little
bit<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:15.970> did<00:02:16.180> notice<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.599> you<00:02:16.780> can

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
bit and I did notice that you can

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.649 
bit and I did notice that you can
actually<00:02:17.230> put<00:02:17.680> two<00:02:18.280> bb's<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:19.359> of<00:02:19.540> these

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
actually put two bb's in one of these

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.629 
actually put two bb's in one of these
shells<00:02:19.989> there's<00:02:20.620> enough<00:02:20.829> room<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.310> put<00:02:21.489> two

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:21.639 
shells there's enough room to put two

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.000 
shells there's enough room to put two
bb's<00:02:21.999> in<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.359> experimented<00:02:22.930> with<00:02:23.109> it<00:02:23.409> and<00:02:23.560> I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
bb's in so I experimented with it and I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.990 
bb's in so I experimented with it and I
put<00:02:24.280> two<00:02:24.760> be

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
put two be

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.840 
put two be
these<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.360> each<00:02:25.480> one<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.020> essentially<00:02:26.850> 42

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
these in each one so essentially 42

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.150 
these in each one so essentially 42
babies<00:02:28.270> can<00:02:28.540> go<00:02:28.660> into<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.960> magazine<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.740> it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
babies can go into a magazine and it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.910 
babies can go into a magazine and it
fires<00:02:30.400> off<00:02:30.640> two<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.300> time<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.590> makes<00:02:32.800> for

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
fires off two at a time so it makes for

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.280 
fires off two at a time so it makes for
a<00:02:33.100> very<00:02:33.280> interesting<00:02:33.820> shooter<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.080> fact

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
a very interesting shooter in the fact

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.410 
a very interesting shooter in the fact
that<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.710> actually<00:02:35.830> empty<00:02:36.340> 42<00:02:37.240> rounds

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that you can actually empty 42 rounds

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.270 
that you can actually empty 42 rounds
rather<00:02:37.990> quickly<00:02:38.350> because<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:38.920> full<00:02:39.100> auto

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
rather quickly because it is full auto

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.220 
rather quickly because it is full auto
and<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:40.360> worked<00:02:40.510> very<00:02:40.630> well<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.960> didn't<00:02:41.170> have

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
and it worked very well I didn't have

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.840 
and it worked very well I didn't have
any<00:02:41.380> problems<00:02:41.740> when<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.950> shot<00:02:42.160> two<00:02:42.430> rounds<00:02:42.700> at<00:02:42.790> a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
any problems when I shot two rounds at a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.000 
any problems when I shot two rounds at a
time<00:02:43.060> now<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.630> velocity<00:02:43.870> will<00:02:44.350> drop<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> little

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
time now the velocity will drop a little

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.740 
time now the velocity will drop a little
bit<00:02:45.160> obviously<00:02:45.970> because<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.450> have<00:02:46.570> more

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
bit obviously because you have more

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.910 
bit obviously because you have more
weight<00:02:47.020> that<00:02:47.200> you're<00:02:47.290> trying<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.590> push<00:02:47.740> down

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
weight that you're trying to push down

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.420 
weight that you're trying to push down
the<00:02:47.980> barrel<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.520> also<00:02:49.480> did<00:02:49.870> get<00:02:50.080> my<00:02:50.260> co2<00:02:51.300> adapter

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the barrel I also did get my co2 adapter

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.770 
the barrel I also did get my co2 adapter
this<00:02:54.430> might<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.850> little<00:02:55.120> pressure<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.660> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
this might have a little pressure in it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.320 
this might have a little pressure in it
we'll<00:02:56.320> see<00:02:56.530> all<00:02:57.459> right<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.610> did<00:02:57.880> shoot<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.209> all

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
we'll see all right I did shoot it all

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.350 
we'll see all right I did shoot it all
out<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.980> was<00:03:00.190> using<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.940> today's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
out and I was using this on today's

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.940 
out and I was using this on today's
video<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.959> I'll<00:03:02.050> get<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> that<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.620> bit<00:03:02.800> here

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
video and I'll get to that in a bit here

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.410 
video and I'll get to that in a bit here
but<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.160> did<00:03:03.310> take<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.580> gun<00:03:03.760> out<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.880> shoot<00:03:04.239> it

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
but I did take this gun out and shoot it

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.390 
but I did take this gun out and shoot it
at<00:03:04.540> some<00:03:04.810> targets<00:03:05.170> in<00:03:05.290> full<00:03:05.470> auto<00:03:05.620> again<00:03:06.340> I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
at some targets in full auto again I

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.650 
at some targets in full auto again I
wanted<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.790> get<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> little<00:03:07.030> bit<00:03:07.239> more<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.570> an

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
wanted to get a little bit more of an

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.900 
wanted to get a little bit more of an
action<00:03:08.080> shot<00:03:08.320> going<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.830> but<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.670> is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
action shot going on but this is

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.850 
action shot going on but this is
basically<00:03:10.570> what<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:10.930> does<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:16.120> an<00:03:16.209> adapter

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
basically what this does it's an adapter

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.330 
basically what this does it's an adapter
you<00:03:17.860> plug<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.810> it's<00:03:20.320> tight<00:03:20.560> very<00:03:21.220> tight

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
you plug in and it's tight very tight

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.070 
you plug in and it's tight very tight
let<00:03:21.820> me<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.330> going<00:03:22.750> here's<00:03:22.930> my

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.199 
facing that way one in facing this way
and<00:03:44.049> then<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.739> just<00:03:45.040> tighten<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.370> up<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.760> it's

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
and then you just tighten it up so it's

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.180 
and then you just tighten it up so it's
best<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.510> make<00:03:46.720> sure<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.019> on<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.350> gun<00:03:47.530> you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
best to make sure it's on the gun you

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.370 
best to make sure it's on the gun you
tighten<00:03:48.549> this<00:03:48.670> all<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.030> way<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.690> then<00:03:50.200> you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
tighten this all the way in and then you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.870 
tighten this all the way in and then you
would<00:03:50.500> take<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.680> back<00:03:51.040> part<00:03:51.070> tighten<00:03:51.820> the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
would take the back part tighten the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.699 
would take the back part tighten the
back<00:03:52.030> part<00:03:52.360> here<00:03:52.420> all<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.959> way<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.290> to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
back part here all the way and to

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.550 
back part here all the way and to
puncture<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.190> co2<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.690> was<00:03:55.959> able<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.260> get

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
puncture the co2 and I was able to get

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.400 
puncture the co2 and I was able to get
for<00:03:57.459> sure<00:03:57.670> in<00:03:57.970> full<00:03:58.390> auto<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.870> got<00:03:59.079> three

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
for sure in full auto I got three

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.729 
for sure in full auto I got three
magazines<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.610> 63<00:04:01.329> shots<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.560> was

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
magazines so 63 shots and that was

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.280 
magazines so 63 shots and that was
shooting<00:04:02.920> completely<00:04:03.549> in<00:04:03.700> full<00:04:03.910> auto<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.390> did

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
shooting completely in full auto I did

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.199 
shooting completely in full auto I did
have<00:04:05.500> some<00:04:05.769> co2<00:04:06.040> left<00:04:06.400> over<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:06.850> could<00:04:07.090> have

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
have some co2 left over so I could have

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.509 
have some co2 left over so I could have
potentially<00:04:07.780> done<00:04:07.959> another<00:04:08.290> magazine<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:09.430> it

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
potentially done another magazine and it

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.920 
potentially done another magazine and it
would<00:04:09.640> have<00:04:09.700> been<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.850> little<00:04:10.060> bit<00:04:10.269> lower<00:04:10.600> power

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
would have been a little bit lower power

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.590 
would have been a little bit lower power
now<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.980> again<00:04:12.370> was<00:04:12.610> full<00:04:12.850> auto<00:04:13.060> if<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.480> was

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
now that again was full auto if I was

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.840 
now that again was full auto if I was
shooting<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.959> semi-auto<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.739> probably<00:04:15.459> would

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
shooting in semi-auto I probably would

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.759 
shooting in semi-auto I probably would
have<00:04:15.880> been<00:04:16.030> able<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.299> get<00:04:16.510> five<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.530> six

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
have been able to get five to six

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.039 
have been able to get five to six
magazines<00:04:18.310> out<00:04:18.519> of<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.870> absolutely<00:04:19.870> for

much fun shooting in full auto so expect

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.140 
much fun shooting in full auto so expect
three<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.130> four<00:04:30.280> magazines<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.000> warm

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
three to four magazines and warm

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.270 
three to four magazines and warm
temperatures<00:04:31.660> now<00:04:32.350> I'm<00:04:32.500> shooting<00:04:32.800> in<00:04:33.039> cold

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
temperatures now I'm shooting in cold

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.100 
temperatures now I'm shooting in cold
temperatures<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:33.880> three<00:04:34.090> magazines<00:04:34.570> no

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
temperatures so three magazines no

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.570 
temperatures so three magazines no
problem<00:04:35.590> four<00:04:35.830> magazines<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.340> might<00:04:36.490> have

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
problem four magazines I might have

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.490 
problem four magazines I might have
squeaked<00:04:36.820> out<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:37.000> fourth<00:04:37.510> one<00:04:37.720> even<00:04:38.320> in<00:04:38.410> the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
squeaked out a fourth one even in the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.260 
squeaked out a fourth one even in the
cold<00:04:38.680> temperature<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:39.820> hopefully<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.240> gives

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
cold temperature so hopefully that gives

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.480 
cold temperature so hopefully that gives
