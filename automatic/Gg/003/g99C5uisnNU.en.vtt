 more wolves there translated into Portuguese 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.289

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.199
 right and that is a wolf with three heads 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.670

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.900

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.180
 to every wolf if they paulo in a biome 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.170
 different, starting here by playing. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 or fundi booth is a new standard only 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 that the texture of it changes personally and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 also where they paulo for example the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.020
 django will explora sent me jango né 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.000
 I wolf in dilma days that taiga I do not know 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.590
 to find in other biomes 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.650
 I also have the desert wolf face look 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.770
 that he has a cool human right cacti 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.140
 kind of sticking to his skin he said it's 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 sand with the kate parts is also well 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 has a long forest possession 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.329
 foxy globe you say foote face 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.369

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.619
 globe and the forest has biome wolf 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.290
 of mushroom galley yes one of the biomes 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.780
 more difficult to find the minecraft and there 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.229
 You can find a mushroom globe 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.450
 has a new one of the plains that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.060
 if that's the case if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.870
 This biome that I have to rain on is a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.060
 Wolf 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.420
 I do not know but is mischievous with this list 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.459
 It's expensive to have a little alfredo has 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.459
 the snow logo is old and he is well 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.890
 also looks at his texture and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.470
 everyone has the same kind of life, right? 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.110
 there, it only changes basically the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.569
 texture and all are domesticated with 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.330
 bone and also if you want to give a 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.599
 meat for him to reproduce here too 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.410
 You can do this, you do not have the lobby 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.810
 fans 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.709
 I do not know what the biome is. 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.200
 but his texture is illegal until I have 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.650
 mountains wolf né 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.680

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.700

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.940
 Little bit of the old sonic I do not know why but 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.280
 He recalled some of sonic and older 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.040
 of all is the wolf that you find in the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.880
 I'm the defendant, that wolf, if I do not 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.880
 deceit of Greek mythology that he is 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.950

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.959

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.579
 mothers arias but this wolf is Sergio 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.579

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.639
 three heads old fair the Mass and 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.130

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.319

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.750
 You can be there walking through your 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.430
