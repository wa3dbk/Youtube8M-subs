00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
more archers if you don't get it in the

first<00:00:37.309> group<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.510> next<00:00:38.930> thing<00:00:39.110> we're<00:00:39.260> going

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
first group the next thing we're going

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.049 
first group the next thing we're going
to<00:00:39.410> do<00:00:39.649> we're<00:00:39.949> bringing<00:00:40.309> in<00:00:40.370> barbarians<00:00:40.969> so

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
to do we're bringing in barbarians so

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.430 
to do we're bringing in barbarians so
we're<00:00:41.210> just<00:00:41.239> using<00:00:41.539> archers<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.260> barbarians

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
we're just using archers and barbarians

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.680 
we're just using archers and barbarians
I<00:00:43.129> had<00:00:43.370> thought<00:00:43.579> about<00:00:43.640> using<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.239> wall<00:00:44.449> breaker

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
I had thought about using a wall breaker

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.090 
I had thought about using a wall breaker
but<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:44.989> don't<00:00:45.170> think<00:00:45.289> a<00:00:45.440> wall<00:00:45.620> breaker<00:00:45.859> is

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
but I don't think a wall breaker is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.099 
but I don't think a wall breaker is
really<00:00:46.430> necessary<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:47.269> think<00:00:47.629> it'll<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:47.930> add

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
really necessary I think it'll just add

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.099 
really necessary I think it'll just add
more<00:00:48.440> cost<00:00:48.859> to<00:00:49.370> your<00:00:49.640> elixir<00:00:50.059> for<00:00:50.539> training<00:00:50.989> an

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
more cost to your elixir for training an

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.919 
more cost to your elixir for training an
army<00:00:51.590> with<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.820> wall<00:00:53.149> breaker<00:00:53.390> you<00:00:53.600> could<00:00:53.750> bring

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
army with a wall breaker you could bring

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.990 
army with a wall breaker you could bring
to<00:00:54.260> wall<00:00:54.469> breakers<00:00:54.859> sort<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.190> in<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.429> back<00:00:55.760> of

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
to wall breakers sort of in the back of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.020 
to wall breakers sort of in the back of
the<00:00:56.120> base<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.710> take<00:00:57.710> out<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.190> intersecting

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the base and take out the intersecting

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.479 
the base and take out the intersecting
walls<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.719> have<00:00:59.870> access<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.469> all<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:01.070> areas

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
walls and have access to all the areas

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.810 
walls and have access to all the areas
in<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.050> Goblin<00:01:03.410> base<00:01:03.589> here<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.190> I<00:01:04.489> think

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
in the the Goblin base here but I think

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.000 
in the the Goblin base here but I think
we<00:01:04.910> just<00:01:05.030> break<00:01:05.269> through<00:01:05.660> eat<00:01:06.320> quite<00:01:06.770> easily

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
we just break through eat quite easily

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.730 
we just break through eat quite easily
especially<00:01:07.820> when<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.390> cannons<00:01:08.840> were<00:01:09.410> kind<00:01:09.620> of

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
especially when the cannons were kind of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.500 
especially when the cannons were kind of
distracted<00:01:10.310> with<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.670> archers<00:01:11.030> going<00:01:11.360> down

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
distracted with the archers going down

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.710 
distracted with the archers going down
the<00:01:11.660> middle<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.590> yeah<00:01:13.550> we're<00:01:13.880> completing

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
the middle so yeah we're completing

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.140 
the middle so yeah we're completing
number<00:01:15.020> 33<00:01:15.440> still<00:01:15.740> pretty<00:01:15.950> easy<00:01:16.160> we're<00:01:16.850> still

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
number 33 still pretty easy we're still

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.570 
number 33 still pretty easy we're still
using<00:01:17.390> very<00:01:17.990> sort<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.590> low-level<00:01:19.010> troops<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
using very sort of low-level troops and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.280 
using very sort of low-level troops and
what<00:01:19.730> I<00:01:19.760> mean<00:01:19.940> by<00:01:20.000> low<00:01:20.300> level<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.810> there<00:01:21.080> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
what I mean by low level is there the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.110 
what I mean by low level is there the
first<00:01:21.530> troops<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.160> unlock<00:01:22.520> barbarians

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
first troops that you unlock barbarians

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.890 
first troops that you unlock barbarians
archers<00:01:23.660> we<00:01:24.500> haven't<00:01:24.860> really<00:01:25.040> gotten<00:01:25.460> into

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
archers we haven't really gotten into

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.590 
archers we haven't really gotten into
using<00:01:26.900> more<00:01:27.140> advanced<00:01:27.470> troops<00:01:27.770> including

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
using more advanced troops including

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.030 
using more advanced troops including
including<00:01:29.600> our<00:01:29.780> barbarian<00:01:30.350> King<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.830> think

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040

can<00:01:39.020> pass<00:01:39.290> through<00:01:39.650> these<00:01:40.370> bases<00:01:41.000> quite

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
can pass through these bases quite

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.290 
can pass through these bases quite
easily<00:01:41.630> just<00:01:42.200> using<00:01:42.680> basic<00:01:43.250> troops<00:01:43.610> for<00:01:44.210> as

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
easily just using basic troops for as

that's going to stop I mean I think I've

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.470 
that's going to stop I mean I think I've
recorded<00:01:48.080> up<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.470> about<00:01:48.770> 30<00:01:49.100> number<00:01:49.610> 35<00:01:50.090> I

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
recorded up to about 30 number 35 I
