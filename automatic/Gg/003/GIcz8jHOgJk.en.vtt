what<00:00:03.759> it<00:00:03.940> is<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:05.200> that<00:00:05.529> the<00:00:05.770> return<00:00:06.069> spring<00:00:06.899> is

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899 
what it is is that the return spring is

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.160 
what it is is that the return spring is
perfectly<00:00:08.410> there

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
perfectly there

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.359 
perfectly there
this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> flag<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.780> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.929> begin<00:00:13.369> is

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
this is the flag it this is begin is

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.620 
this is the flag it this is begin is
that<00:00:14.580> right<00:00:15.710> I<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:17.490> put<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:17.849> in<00:00:18.000> dishing

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
that right I just put the one in dishing

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.380 
that right I just put the one in dishing
water<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:20.150> okay

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
water here okay

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.389 
water here okay
delay<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.110> is<00:00:22.259> a<00:00:22.410> readable<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:25.250> first<00:00:26.250> we

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:26.399 
delay this is a readable and first we

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.290 
delay this is a readable and first we
put<00:00:26.579> the<00:00:26.790> first<00:00:27.119> ring<00:00:27.390> here

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.560 

in<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.960> transaction<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.919> the<00:00:32.450> Reagan<00:00:33.450> era

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
in this transaction when the Reagan era

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.680 
in this transaction when the Reagan era
is<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.800> will<00:00:34.949> be<00:00:35.129> more<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.149> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
is going on it will be more and that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.689 
is going on it will be more and that
birth<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:38.480> provide<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.070> may<00:00:41.070> transmit<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
birth that provide the may transmit the

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.939 
birth that provide the may transmit the
power<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.269> apply<00:00:42.570> will<00:00:42.750> then<00:00:43.410> fly<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
power from the apply will then fly me to

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.689 
power from the apply will then fly me to
the<00:00:44.600> great<00:00:45.600> bender<00:00:46.079> whether<00:00:49.159> my<00:00:50.159> generator

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
the great bender whether my generator

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.119 
the great bender whether my generator
and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:51.629> later<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.530> an<00:00:52.769> interval

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and then later when it's an interval

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.450 
and then later when it's an interval
will<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.550> somebody<00:00:54.030> Joe<00:00:54.300> electricity<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.159> our

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
will be somebody Joe electricity so our

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
will be somebody Joe electricity so our
project<00:00:56.729> lead<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.360> mechanical<00:00:57.960> rotation<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
project lead our mechanical rotation is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:10.230 
project lead our mechanical rotation is
converted<00:00:59.550> into<00:00:59.729> the<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:04.039> put<00:01:05.039> to<00:01:05.850> explain

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.990 

arrangement<00:01:17.979> then<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.520> written

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
arrangement then this is written

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.389 
arrangement then this is written
speaking<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.509> bolt<00:01:20.720> on<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.100> pinion<00:01:22.100> is

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
speaking the bolt on the pinion is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.050 
speaking the bolt on the pinion is
rotated<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.710> after<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.860> flapping<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.850> about

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
rotated and after that flapping is about

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.010 
rotated and after that flapping is about
it<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.740> convert<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.830> into<00:01:27.890> electrical<00:01:28.460> energy

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
it and convert it into electrical energy

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.639 
it and convert it into electrical energy
first<00:01:30.020> one<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:31.000> first<00:01:32.000> we<00:01:32.179> fix<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:32.840> and

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
first one is first we fix this one and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.450 
first one is first we fix this one and
apply<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.039> first<00:01:34.399> push<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.509> is<00:01:36.200> that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
apply the first push on the is that

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.819 
apply the first push on the is that
assume<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.820> railroad<00:01:38.240> track<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.229> then

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
assume is that railroad track and then

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.469 
assume is that railroad track and then
we<00:01:40.329> press<00:01:41.329> this<00:01:41.509> one<00:01:41.920> yeah<00:01:42.920> just<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:44.060> it

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
we press this one yeah just so that it

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:56.190 
we press this one yeah just so that it
is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.380 

their<00:01:56.829> next<00:01:57.130> button<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:57.430> suing<00:01:57.969> of<00:01:58.149> my<00:01:58.450> partner
