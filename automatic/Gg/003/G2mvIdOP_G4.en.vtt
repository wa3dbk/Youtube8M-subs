today<00:00:28.320> we're<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> talk<00:00:28.980> about<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
today we're going to talk about the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
today we're going to talk about the
importance<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.330> your<00:00:30.929> arms<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.710> how<00:00:31.859> they

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
importance of your arms and how they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.330 
importance of your arms and how they
play<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> great<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.030> great<00:00:33.809> deal<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.440> running<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
play a great a great deal in running a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
play a great a great deal in running a
lot<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> times<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.540> we'll<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.899> people

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
lot of times you know we'll see people

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
lot of times you know we'll see people
trying<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> run<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.800> no<00:00:38.160> arms<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
trying to run with no arms you know the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
trying to run with no arms you know the
arms<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.629> oh<00:00:39.930> yeah<00:00:40.379> someone<00:00:40.680> told<00:00:40.950> me<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
arms down oh yeah someone told me that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
arms down oh yeah someone told me that
was<00:00:41.399> efficient<00:00:41.989> or<00:00:42.989> you'll<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.350> people

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
was efficient or you'll see people

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
was efficient or you'll see people
carrying<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> contrary<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.629> using

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
carrying on the contrary like not using

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
carrying on the contrary like not using
them<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.620> carrying<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.700> high<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
them at all but carrying really high and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.400 
them at all but carrying really high and
rotating<00:00:48.690> across<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.260> chest<00:00:51.050> remember<00:00:52.050> we

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
rotating across the chest remember we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
rotating across the chest remember we
want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> try<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> run<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> whole<00:00:53.820> body

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
want to try to run with the whole body

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.560 
want to try to run with the whole body
and<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.960> means<00:00:55.170> using<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.800> body<00:00:56.190> parts

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
and that means using all body parts

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
and that means using all body parts
simultaneously<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> move<00:00:57.989> us<00:00:58.170> forward<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
simultaneously to move us forward so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
simultaneously to move us forward so
listen<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.059> about<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.870> washing<00:01:01.620> machine

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
listen I think about a washing machine

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.490 
listen I think about a washing machine
effect<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> affecting<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:04.260> hips

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
effect because this is affecting my hips

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
effect because this is affecting my hips
and<00:01:04.710> lower<00:01:04.860> back<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.000> torque<00:01:06.299> across

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and lower back if I really torque across

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.039 
and lower back if I really torque across
and<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.710> probably<00:01:08.430> over<00:01:08.640> striding<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.330> my

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and I'm probably over striding and my

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
and I'm probably over striding and my
hips<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.470> torqued<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.890> forward<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.490> my

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
hips are torqued out forward then my

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
hips are torqued out forward then my
upper<00:01:11.880> body<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> counter<00:01:12.930> torque

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
upper body is going to counter torque

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.950 
upper body is going to counter torque
and<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> push<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:14.790> hard<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.780> get

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and now I got a push off hard to get

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.840 
and now I got a push off hard to get
forward<00:01:16.439> there's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> wasted<00:01:17.580> motion

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
forward there's a lot of wasted motion

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.039 
forward there's a lot of wasted motion
there<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.479> keep<00:01:18.689> talking<00:01:18.840> about

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
there and we keep talking about

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.800 
there and we keep talking about
efficient<00:01:19.680> running<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.119> efficient<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
efficient running the more efficient you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.890 
efficient running the more efficient you
are<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> car<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.909> you're

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
are just like a like a car if you're

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
are just like a like a car if you're
more<00:01:25.110> efficient<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.890> mileage<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
more efficient than your mileage is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.590 
more efficient than your mileage is
better<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:26.909> wear<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> tear<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
better and your wear and tear on the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.780 
better and your wear and tear on the
parts<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.170> better<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.220> yourself<00:01:29.610> as

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
parts is better so think of yourself as

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.450 
parts is better so think of yourself as
this<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.299> fine-tuned<00:01:30.960> Porsche<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.280> know

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this really fine-tuned Porsche you know

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
this really fine-tuned Porsche you know
so<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.079> want<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so we want to think about how we want to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
so we want to think about how we want to
move<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> whole<00:01:35.220> body<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
move with the whole body so what if I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.679 
move with the whole body so what if I
did<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.619> let's<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.340> real<00:01:38.850> real

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
did this let's think about real real

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.289 
did this let's think about real real
precise<00:01:40.170> movements<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.189> legs<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.790> lifting

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
precise movements the legs are lifting

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.080 
precise movements the legs are lifting
and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> opposite<00:01:44.009> arm<00:01:44.220> comes<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and then the opposite arm comes up to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
and then the opposite arm comes up to
counterbalance<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.020> body<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.579> how

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
counterbalance the body you can see how

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.149 
counterbalance the body you can see how
that<00:01:48.329> happens<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.079> make<00:01:49.229> some<00:01:49.470> real<00:01:49.710> precise

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that happens and make some real precise

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.030 
that happens and make some real precise
moves<00:01:50.750> where<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> deliberately<00:01:52.560> bring<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
moves where you deliberately bring the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.600 
moves where you deliberately bring the
arms

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
arms

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
arms
and<00:01:53.850> forward<00:01:54.120> and<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:54.690> called<00:01:54.990> contra

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and forward and that's called contra

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.710 
and forward and that's called contra
lateral<00:01:55.740> movement<00:01:56.370> so<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.760> side<00:01:57.060> moves

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
lateral movement so if this side moves

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.350 
lateral movement so if this side moves
up<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> forward<00:01:58.620> then<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.280> opposite<00:01:59.880> arm<00:02:00.090> has

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
up and forward then the opposite arm has

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.900 
up and forward then the opposite arm has
to<00:02:00.390> counterbalance<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.190> let's<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.640> this

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
to counterbalance so let's get this

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.300 
to counterbalance so let's get this
going<00:02:02.970> for<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> moment<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.200> drill<00:02:04.650> real

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
going for a moment as a drill real
