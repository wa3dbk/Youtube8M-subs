00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.230
 over green 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.990
 for Carlos for 20 thousand tic 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.049
 of gy and write in five steps how to implement a computerized system of 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.840
 distribution in a company 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.930
 first define the needs of the inter company can be improved 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.390
 second look for what is the team and the four program for the implementation 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.680
 third ista lara the program 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 fourth configure the logistics processes of each company and 5th 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 it is clear to see that the bravo bravo system has closed 15 sep 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.249
 for something is our champion 17 for Carlos asked to stop doing 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.789
 carlos you have to choose over yellow 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.309
 tachÃ¡n tachÃ¡n three questions of true or false with explanation for 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.899
 almudena for 10 thousand tics true or false having computerized 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:25.049
 logistics distribution processes helps us to improve planning and 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.299
 to give better quality of customer service of course yes 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.679
 true 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.949
 since this is how everything is centralized and we save time and effort 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:39.319
 In addition, different logistics centers can be grouped if the company 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.179
 are physically separated and thus give a more integrated service will be in 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.309
 coordination 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.649
 systems can not be modified if there is an impact on the process 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.489
 something that characterizes these computerized systems is their flexibility and that 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.589
 can be modified in real time if there is a problem in the distribution 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.819
 the traceability control of the products 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.200
 2 jose to the tracking of the products 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.710
 is one of the characteristics of these programs because we can know 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.459
 at all times where is the merchandise 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.469
 spectacular 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.040
 Bravo brave for something are the best 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
 lgg almudena 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.689
 the negative question 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.589
 As you already know if you do not hit, you will have less than 10 thousand tics and this time 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:29.619
 or deal with anyone tell me three objections that companies can put 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.510
 before a computerized logistics distribution system begins 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.269
 beatriz 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.549
 that's why it has more advantages 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.029
 that you do not want to change the old system or because the changes give something of 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.079
 fear 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.009
 what 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.279
 that you have to learn to use the program 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.639
 the third all 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.729
 time and we have a pension 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.979
 the voice of our supercontinent 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:59.010
 sometimes companies do not want to have centralized all the control 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.659
 because that gives excessive responsibility to the logistics manager 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:04.909
 you choose again 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:05.939
 On yellow 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.159
 the jumping question begins beatriz 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.529
 characteristics of a computerized logistics distribution system 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.549
 There is more flexibility in the delivery of the merchandise collection 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.319
 improves coordination between providers both tennis players 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.449
 distributors and customers 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.300
 because the flow of communication is more controlled 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 accelerates the distribution process 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.889
 change how the system is maintained 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.150
 the epic step 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.949
 supervising the correct operation and continuously feeding the system 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:37.879
 contracts 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.860
 schedules 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.169
 routes costs and so redesign so that the whole process works better 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.169
 wonderful fantastic response 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.490
 Well yes it will be in the program 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.729
 December finds entertaining things 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.580
 you think it would be good to put a computerized distribution system in 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.479
 my business 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.789
 may interest you 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.979
 You already know that it has a cost but it was found in the merchandise 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.649
 because you always knew where when and how to locate it 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.289
