00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I'm not great at drawing but I'll just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.639 
I'm not great at drawing but I'll just
give<00:01:08.609> you<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:09.179> better<00:01:09.539> idea<00:01:09.749> of<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
give you some a better idea of how the

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.980 
give you some a better idea of how the
pattern<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> formed<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.479> I've<00:01:12.659> drawn<00:01:12.960> some

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pattern is formed now I've drawn some

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.440 
pattern is formed now I've drawn some
lines<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.280> piece<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> paper<00:01:14.909> about<00:01:15.179> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
lines on this piece of paper about the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.120 
lines on this piece of paper about the
size<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.289> we<00:01:16.439> were<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> work

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
size work that we were going to work

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
size work that we were going to work
with<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.549> we've<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.119> inches<00:01:18.149> here

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
with so we've got about two inches here

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
with so we've got about two inches here
and<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.229> four<00:01:19.499> inches<00:01:19.859> here<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.609> going<00:01:20.969> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and about four inches here I'm going to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.959 
and about four inches here I'm going to
start<00:01:21.329> with<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.810> inch<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.319> and

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
start with the two inch one and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.980 
start with the two inch one and
basically<00:01:23.969> we're<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.689> draw<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
basically we're just going to draw a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.309 
basically we're just going to draw a
spiral<00:01:26.749> into<00:01:27.749> the<00:01:27.990> middle<00:01:28.289> and<00:01:28.499> out<00:01:30.200> until<00:01:31.200> we

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
spiral into the middle and out until we

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.279 
spiral into the middle and out until we
come<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.950> point<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.259> then<00:01:34.259> we

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
come to this point right here then we

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.669 
come to this point right here then we
take<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:35.069> with<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.429> little<00:01:36.469> scooping<00:01:37.469> back

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
take it out with a little scooping back

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.529 
take it out with a little scooping back
and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.609> we're<00:01:38.789> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.999> go<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
and then we're going to go on to the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.690 
and then we're going to go on to the
next<00:01:39.749> spiral<00:01:40.350> sit<00:01:40.530> come<00:01:40.679> over<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> side

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.330 

spiral<00:01:44.700> come<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.929> on<00:01:46.200> yourself<00:01:48.289> over<00:01:49.340> back

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
spiral come back on yourself over back

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:05.929 
spiral come back on yourself over back
and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.569> a<00:01:51.600> spiral<00:01:52.170> again

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.029 

now<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.570> wider<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.499> I've<00:02:07.590> used<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
now the wider one that I've used in the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
now the wider one that I've used in the
border<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.369> exactly<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> same<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
border is exactly the same it's just a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
border is exactly the same it's just a
little<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.989> bigger<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:12.080> you're<00:02:13.080> probably

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
little bit bigger so you're probably

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
little bit bigger so you're probably
fine<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.459> need<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> go<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.180> bit

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
fine that you need to go in a little bit

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.550 
fine that you need to go in a little bit
more<00:02:15.599> onto<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.989> spiral<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.080> edge<00:02:19.290> now

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
more onto the spiral out on the edge now

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.089 
more onto the spiral out on the edge now
remember<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.099> don't<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.580> perfect

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
remember you don't have to be perfect

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.309 
remember you don't have to be perfect
especially<00:02:23.099> when<00:02:23.610> you're<00:02:23.730> drawing<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.390> get

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
especially when you're drawing just get

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:42.030 
especially when you're drawing just get
into<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.709> flow<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.840> into<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> middle

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340 

okay<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.100> that's<00:02:43.400> our<00:02:43.550> border<00:02:44.030> pieces<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:45.080> for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
okay so that's our border pieces now for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.040 
okay so that's our border pieces now for
the<00:02:45.440> all-over<00:02:45.620> design<00:02:46.480> we<00:02:47.480> start<00:02:47.810> with<00:02:47.960> the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
the all-over design we start with the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.550 
the all-over design we start with the
little<00:02:48.200> spiral<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.920> middle<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:50.330> out

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
little spiral in the middle in and out

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.820 
little spiral in the middle in and out
and<00:02:51.560> then<00:02:51.770> we're<00:02:51.920> gonna<00:02:52.040> echo<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.940> around

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and then we're gonna echo that around

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760 
and then we're gonna echo that around
don't<00:02:54.830> go<00:02:54.950> all<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.220> way<00:02:55.520> into<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.360> center<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
don't go all the way into the center the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.550 
don't go all the way into the center the
end<00:02:58.160> out<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.940> then<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.840> leads<00:03:00.020> us<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
end out and then that leads us on to the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:13.860 
end out and then that leads us on to the
next<00:03:00.740> one<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.220> spiral

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.500 

they<00:03:14.349> can<00:03:14.530> see<00:03:14.739> how<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:14.980> fills<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.400> space

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
they can see how it fills the space

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.949 
they can see how it fills the space
nicely<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:17.290> also<00:03:18.450> quite<00:03:19.450> good<00:03:19.480> if<00:03:19.780> you've

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
nicely it's also quite good if you've

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.619 
nicely it's also quite good if you've
got<00:03:20.110> get<00:03:20.409> stuck<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.950> spot<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.120> echo

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
got get stuck in a spot you can echo

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:31.500 
got get stuck in a spot you can echo
around<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> next<00:03:26.049> place<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:31.209> doesn't

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
around to the next place it doesn't

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.830 
around to the next place it doesn't
matter<00:03:31.629> which<00:03:31.810> way<00:03:32.019> your<00:03:32.200> spiral<00:03:32.500> goes<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:33.840> just

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
matter which way your spiral goes I just

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.830 
matter which way your spiral goes I just
vary<00:03:35.409> it<00:03:35.560> up<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.799> little<00:03:35.980> bit<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.569> can<00:03:40.720> also

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
vary it up a little bit and you can also

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.930 
vary it up a little bit and you can also
take<00:03:41.200> them<00:03:41.409> off<00:03:41.560> two<00:03:41.799> angles<00:03:42.489> different

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
take them off two angles different

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:53.110 
take them off two angles different
angles<00:03:43.269> as<00:03:43.450> well

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.990 

did<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.780> go<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> that'll<00:03:55.550> give<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.760> some<00:03:55.970> idea

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
did it go so that'll give you some idea

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.820 
did it go so that'll give you some idea
now<00:03:56.720> we're<00:03:56.870> going<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.050> go<00:03:57.170> over<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.620> I'm<00:03:57.680> going

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
now we're going to go over and I'm going

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.170 
now we're going to go over and I'm going
to<00:03:57.860> show<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.040> how<00:03:58.280> we've<00:03:58.430> coated<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.030> our

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
to show you how we've coated it on our

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.890 
to show you how we've coated it on our
design<00:04:00.190> now<00:04:01.190> you'll<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:01.849> I've<00:04:02.030> drawn

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
design now you'll see that I've drawn

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.320 
design now you'll see that I've drawn
the<00:04:03.080> lines<00:04:03.290> on<00:04:03.620> again<00:04:03.950> obviously<00:04:04.640> with<00:04:05.150> you're

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
the lines on again obviously with you're

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.699 
the lines on again obviously with you're
working<00:04:05.599> on<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.720> quote<00:04:06.019> you'll<00:04:06.230> be<00:04:06.379> working

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
working on a quote you'll be working

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.110 
working on a quote you'll be working
with<00:04:06.739> your<00:04:07.010> setting<00:04:07.370> strokes<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:07.849> you<00:04:07.910> don't

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
with your setting strokes so you don't

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.530 
with your setting strokes so you don't
need<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.510> draw<00:04:09.110> any<00:04:09.260> lines<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.799> I<00:04:10.120> like<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.390> work

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
need to draw any lines on I like to work

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.390 
need to draw any lines on I like to work
about<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.930> quarter<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.470> an<00:04:12.590> inch<00:04:12.709> from<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.220> ear

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
about a quarter of an inch from the ear

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.490 
about a quarter of an inch from the ear
so<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.610> go<00:04:13.849> right<00:04:14.030> up<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.480> line<00:04:14.660> try<00:04:15.349> and

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
so I go right up to the line try and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.939 
so I go right up to the line try and
keep<00:04:15.650> my<00:04:16.570> design<00:04:17.570> with<00:04:17.930> an<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.470> quarter<00:04:18.769> inch

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
keep my design with an the quarter inch

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.870 
keep my design with an the quarter inch
from<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.370> edge<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:25.460> I'm<00:04:25.580> going<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.790> be

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
from the edge and I'm going to be

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.219 
from the edge and I'm going to be
working<00:04:26.030> sideways

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
working sideways

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:36.620 
working sideways
so<00:04:27.440> we're<00:04:27.590> going<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.830> go<00:04:27.979> into<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.610> middle

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.720 

when<00:04:37.350> we<00:04:37.470> get<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.770> daddy<00:04:37.980> I've<00:04:38.220> seen<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.580> do

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
when we get to daddy I've seen you do

00:04:38.730 --> 00:05:05.230 
when we get to daddy I've seen you do
your<00:04:38.880> little<00:04:39.680> scoped<00:04:40.680> out<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.760> back

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.030 

so<00:05:06.240> I'm<00:05:06.330> just<00:05:06.480> alternating<00:05:06.750> from<00:05:07.410> one<00:05:07.680> eaves

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
so I'm just alternating from one eaves

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:17.710 
so I'm just alternating from one eaves
from<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.430> other<00:05:08.640> edge

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.930 

also<00:05:18.500> remain<00:05:18.860> within<00:05:19.100> me<00:05:19.250> very<00:05:19.550> much<00:05:19.700> and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
also remain within me very much and

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.990 
also remain within me very much and
closing<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:20.540> this<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:22.310> doesn't<00:05:22.520> make<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.790> big

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
closing like this it doesn't make a big

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.410 
closing like this it doesn't make a big
connects

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.240 

try<00:05:28.420> and<00:05:28.570> keep<00:05:28.720> your<00:05:28.870> speed<00:05:29.200> consistent<00:05:30.070> as

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
try and keep your speed consistent as

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.650 
try and keep your speed consistent as
well<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:31.960> find<00:05:32.170> that<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.500> person<00:05:33.660> that's

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
well and you find that the person that's

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.290 
well and you find that the person that's
a<00:05:34.930> little<00:05:35.290> bit<00:05:35.530> easier<00:05:38.820> now<00:05:39.820> we're<00:05:39.970> gonna<00:05:40.090> do

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
a little bit easier now we're gonna do

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.750 
a little bit easier now we're gonna do
the<00:05:40.450> big<00:05:40.690> border<00:05:41.260> exactly<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.010> same<00:05:42.250> as<00:05:42.550> the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
the big border exactly the same as the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.970 
the big border exactly the same as the
little<00:05:43.030> one<00:05:43.150> obvious<00:05:43.750> difference<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.860> we

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
little one obvious difference is that we

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.350 
little one obvious difference is that we
just<00:05:45.130> need<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.400> go<00:05:45.520> on<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.670> little<00:05:45.910> bit<00:05:46.090> further

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
just need to go on a little bit further

00:05:46.360 --> 00:06:17.340 
just need to go on a little bit further
into<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.230> middle

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.710 

you<00:06:18.040> will<00:06:18.160> have<00:06:18.280> noticed<00:06:18.760> and<00:06:18.970> doing<00:06:19.600> those

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
you will have noticed and doing those

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.610 
you will have noticed and doing those
designs<00:06:20.230> the<00:06:20.530> first<00:06:20.770> one<00:06:20.980> I<00:06:21.100> did<00:06:21.130> sideways<00:06:21.880> and

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
designs the first one I did sideways and

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.680 
designs the first one I did sideways and
the<00:06:23.620> second<00:06:23.980> one<00:06:24.100> I<00:06:24.250> did<00:06:24.610> coming<00:06:25.060> towards<00:06:25.510> me

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
the second one I did coming towards me

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.390 
the second one I did coming towards me
so<00:06:25.900> it's<00:06:26.020> totally<00:06:26.230> up<00:06:26.500> to<00:06:26.530> yo<00:06:26.830> work<00:06:27.130> it

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
so it's totally up to yo work it

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.990 
so it's totally up to yo work it
whatever<00:06:27.880> suits<00:06:28.240> suits<00:06:28.810> you<00:06:29.700> now<00:06:30.700> we're<00:06:30.880> going

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
whatever suits suits you now we're going

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.749 
whatever suits suits you now we're going
to<00:06:31.090> work<00:06:31.210> on<00:06:31.480> the<00:06:31.570> overall<00:06:31.960> design

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:07:21.350 

it's<00:06:40.759> that<00:06:40.969> with<00:06:41.149> a<00:06:41.269> little<00:06:41.389> farm<00:06:41.809> meadow

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.449 

as<00:07:22.360> you<00:07:22.569> can<00:07:22.779> see<00:07:23.020> this<00:07:23.229> coating<00:07:23.559> design<00:07:24.099> gives

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:24.459 
as you can see this coating design gives

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.149 
as you can see this coating design gives
great<00:07:24.909> texture<00:07:25.719> to<00:07:25.899> this<00:07:26.050> quote<00:07:26.409> even<00:07:26.770> though

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.159 
great texture to this quote even though

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.579 
great texture to this quote even though
you<00:07:27.219> can't<00:07:27.639> exactly<00:07:28.270> see<00:07:28.749> the<00:07:28.899> design<00:07:29.319> in

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:29.589 
you can't exactly see the design in

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.969 
you can't exactly see the design in
there<00:07:29.830> it<00:07:30.219> creates<00:07:30.759> this<00:07:31.059> nice<00:07:31.469> will<00:07:32.469> pulley

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
there it creates this nice will pulley

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.149 
there it creates this nice will pulley
effect<00:07:33.699> and<00:07:34.119> the<00:07:34.749> same<00:07:34.990> with<00:07:35.169> the<00:07:35.259> spiral<00:07:35.860> then

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:36.159 
effect and the same with the spiral then

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:39.389 
effect and the same with the spiral then
echoing<00:07:36.909> out<00:07:37.059> into<00:07:37.479> the<00:07:38.159> design<00:07:39.159> and<00:07:39.339> the

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:39.399 
echoing out into the design and the

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.219 
echoing out into the design and the
setting<00:07:39.909> I've<00:07:40.569> just<00:07:40.839> done<00:07:40.990> it<00:07:41.080> with<00:07:41.169> a

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:41.229 
setting I've just done it with a

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:44.159 
setting I've just done it with a
contrasting<00:07:42.009> thread<00:07:42.069> there<00:07:42.699> just<00:07:43.419> to<00:07:43.629> tone<00:07:44.139> it

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:44.169 
contrasting thread there just to tone it

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:46.320
