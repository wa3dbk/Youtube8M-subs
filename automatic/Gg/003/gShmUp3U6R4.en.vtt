00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.010
 porridge I am convinced that this is the best food for 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.990
 start of the day for cooking quality 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.439
 carrots onions spices and dried fruits begin 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.529
 onion must be crushed to shock 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.719
 month of carrots in order not to cry 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.850
 from the bow remember to rinse the knife 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 cold water and even better as possible 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.410
 cut onion less so as not to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 I had to pass it for a long time and than 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 the longer we fry the worse for health 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 and our task is to prepare a healthy breakfast 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 well we rub carrots also for 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 breakfast is fantastic because 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.300
 that firstly the second energy 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.270
 rich and believe if there is porridge in the morning 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.340
 that evening oddly enough supper 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.110
 lightly with the onion of carrots and 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.420
 remind don't let 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 amine overheating is important because 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 that the longer the oil is heated and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.369
 more carcinogens it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 stands out 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.350
 Well, leaving with languishing beam with 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 carrot and at this time intima dried fruits 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.670
 dried fruits to use in order 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.180
 First diversify our dishes from 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.220
 cereals 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 and secondly in order to give it 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.840
 great benefit and dried fruit is a fount 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.909
 beneficial substances 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.340
 and most importantly dried fruits any Greeks 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.619
 very important is a full breakfast from 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.539
 fully run and have a good dinner 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.920

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.899
 snacking roles 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.289

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.729
 performed above the surface of the rhythms 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.649
 Generally if you cook seems to remember 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.590
