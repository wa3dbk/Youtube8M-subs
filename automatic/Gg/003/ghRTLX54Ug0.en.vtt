00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370 

the<00:00:00.149> kind<00:00:00.390> of<00:00:00.450> fundamental<00:00:01.020> things<00:00:01.230> I

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
the kind of fundamental things I

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.420 
the kind of fundamental things I
practice<00:00:01.890> are<00:00:03.650> usually<00:00:04.650> double<00:00:05.069> strokes

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
practice are usually double strokes

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:15.259 
practice are usually double strokes
between<00:00:05.910> snare<00:00:06.420> drum<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.750> bass<00:00:06.960> drum<00:00:13.849> and<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
between snare drum and bass drum and a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.630 
between snare drum and bass drum and a
different<00:00:15.719> volume<00:00:16.190> different<00:00:17.190> dynamic

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
different volume different dynamic

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:33.130 
different volume different dynamic
levels<00:00:18.029> different<00:00:18.420> speeds

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:01:02.110 

and<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> permutations<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.940> phrase

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.680 

and<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.450> you<00:01:03.510> got<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.989> relaxed<00:01:08.479> but<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
and so you got to be relaxed but the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.810 
and so you got to be relaxed but the
truth<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.410> actually<00:01:10.649> harder<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.700> at

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
truth is is actually harder to do it at

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:26.290 
truth is is actually harder to do it at
this

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.140 

more<00:01:27.300> room<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.690> fall<00:01:27.870> apart<00:01:28.220> before<00:01:29.220> work<00:01:29.760> more

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
more room to fall apart before work more

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.420 
more room to fall apart before work more
chance<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.590> about<00:01:31.770> where<00:01:32.190> you're<00:01:32.310> going

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
chance to think about where you're going

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.710 
chance to think about where you're going
to<00:01:32.520> place<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.790> note<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> how<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.300> how<00:01:36.660> do

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to place the note so how do you how do

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.200 
to place the note so how do you how do
you<00:01:38.390> how<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.570> deal<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.020> space

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.700 

definitely<00:01:45.210> thinking<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.720> triplets

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.910 

sextuplets<00:01:54.110> whatever<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.260> is<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> help<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
sextuplets whatever it is to help you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.340 
sextuplets whatever it is to help you
feel<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.910> space<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:59.330> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
feel that space so that the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.370 
feel that space so that the
gravitational<00:02:01.350> pull<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:03.050> trying<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.170> pull

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
gravitational pull of the trying to pull

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.500 
gravitational pull of the trying to pull
the<00:02:04.530> stick<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> symbol<00:02:05.700> doesn't<00:02:06.390> happen

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
the stick to the symbol doesn't happen

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:24.670 
the stick to the symbol doesn't happen
early<00:02:07.310> right<00:02:08.310> you've<00:02:08.460> got<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> resist<00:02:09.060> gravity

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.880 

I've<00:02:25.370> even<00:02:25.550> seen<00:02:25.700> some<00:02:25.910> great<00:02:26.440> bass<00:02:27.440> players

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
I've even seen some great bass players

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.610 
I've even seen some great bass players
where<00:02:28.700> their<00:02:28.940> jaw<00:02:29.330> will<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.810> moving<00:02:32.470> when<00:02:33.470> they

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
where their jaw will be moving when they

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.910 
where their jaw will be moving when they
have<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.920> play<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.310> kind<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.640> town<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:36.290> it's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
have to play that kind of town and it's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.020 
have to play that kind of town and it's
it<00:02:37.430> helps<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.270> helps<00:02:38.330> fill<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> space<00:02:40.030> so

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it helps it helps fill the space so

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.340 
it helps it helps fill the space so
that's<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.420> kind<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.780> fundamental

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's a kind of fundamental

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.200 
that's a kind of fundamental
coordination<00:02:43.040> thing<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.370> might<00:02:43.550> practice<00:02:43.850> I

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
coordination thing I might practice I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:03:05.730 
coordination thing I might practice I
could<00:02:44.270> also<00:02:44.540> change<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.200> rate<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.650> triplets

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.180 

bass<00:03:06.740> almost<00:03:07.250> everything<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.880> play<00:03:08.210> is<00:03:08.690> that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
bass almost everything I play is that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.890 
bass almost everything I play is that
with<00:03:10.190> interruptions<00:03:11.740> mostly<00:03:12.740> interruptions

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
with interruptions mostly interruptions

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.950 
with interruptions mostly interruptions
but<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.320> kind<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.800> thing<00:03:17.680> makes<00:03:18.680> sense
