00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.870 
exerciser I always wanted to have good
teeth<00:00:22.749> and<00:00:22.960> I<00:00:23.380> always<00:00:23.529> had<00:00:23.890> problems<00:00:24.130> since<00:00:24.609> I

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
teeth and I always had problems since I

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.589 
teeth and I always had problems since I
can<00:00:25.179> remember<00:00:25.419> myself<00:00:26.109> since<00:00:26.319> I<00:00:26.439> was<00:00:26.589> a<00:00:26.619> child

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
can remember myself since I was a child

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.149 
can remember myself since I was a child
and<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.810> was<00:00:28.960> wondering<00:00:29.349> why<00:00:29.499> some<00:00:29.739> people<00:00:30.009> have

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:30.159 
and I was wondering why some people have

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.800 
and I was wondering why some people have
good<00:00:30.369> teeth<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.849> other<00:00:30.999> people<00:00:31.359> don't<00:00:31.569> have

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
good teeth and other people don't have

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.319 
good teeth and other people don't have
good<00:00:31.869> teeth<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.590> then<00:00:33.160> about<00:00:33.370> five<00:00:33.670> years<00:00:34.030> ago

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
good teeth and then about five years ago

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.529 
good teeth and then about five years ago
I<00:00:34.539> met<00:00:34.600> two<00:00:35.410> sisters<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.219> twin<00:00:36.489> sisters<00:00:36.969> who

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
I met two sisters the twin sisters who

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.229 
I met two sisters the twin sisters who
were<00:00:37.629> in<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.960> late<00:00:38.350> 20s<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.100> one<00:00:39.609> of<00:00:39.760> them<00:00:39.940> had

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
were in the late 20s and one of them had

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.959 
were in the late 20s and one of them had
perfect<00:00:40.840> teeth<00:00:41.019> no<00:00:41.649> cavities<00:00:42.100> at<00:00:42.250> all<00:00:42.429> and<00:00:42.699> the

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
perfect teeth no cavities at all and the

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.029 
perfect teeth no cavities at all and the
other<00:00:43.090> one<00:00:43.300> had<00:00:43.510> lots<00:00:43.719> of<00:00:43.840> tooth<00:00:44.079> decay<00:00:44.109> I<00:00:44.710> kept

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
other one had lots of tooth decay I kept

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.970 
other one had lots of tooth decay I kept
asking<00:00:45.250> them<00:00:45.609> what<00:00:46.120> was<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:47.050> reason<00:00:47.320> why<00:00:47.530> what

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
asking them what was the reason why what

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.470 
asking them what was the reason why what
is<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.280> difference<00:00:48.730> what<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.089> different

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
is the difference what is different

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.200 
is the difference what is different
about<00:00:49.539> you<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.589> then<00:00:51.100> finally<00:00:51.609> they<00:00:51.760> told<00:00:51.820> me

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
about you and then finally they told me

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.939 
about you and then finally they told me
that<00:00:52.390> one<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.629> them<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.199> one<00:00:53.350> who<00:00:53.530> had<00:00:53.679> good

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
that one of them the one who had good

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.910 
that one of them the one who had good
teeth<00:00:54.300> constantly<00:00:55.300> was<00:00:55.449> chewing<00:00:55.780> gum<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
teeth constantly was chewing gum and the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.610 
teeth constantly was chewing gum and the
other<00:00:57.070> one<00:00:57.339> hated<00:00:58.149> gum<00:00:58.359> that<00:00:58.960> prompted<00:00:59.469> me<00:00:59.589> to

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
other one hated gum that prompted me to

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.970 
other one hated gum that prompted me to
start<00:00:59.769> my<00:01:00.159> research<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.870> see<00:01:02.109> if<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.679> chewing

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
start my research to see if the chewing

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.120 
start my research to see if the chewing
a<00:01:03.249> lack<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.699> chewing<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.330> connected<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.130> good

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
a lack of chewing is connected to good

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.420 
a lack of chewing is connected to good
teeth<00:01:06.340> or<00:01:06.610> bad<00:01:07.060> teeth<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:08.890> started<00:01:09.280> to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
teeth or bad teeth and then I started to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.190 
teeth or bad teeth and then I started to
do<00:01:09.550> lots<00:01:09.730> of<00:01:09.850> anthropological<00:01:10.660> research<00:01:10.690> and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
do lots of anthropological research and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.820 
do lots of anthropological research and
I<00:01:11.260> found<00:01:11.530> out<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.370> in<00:01:12.670> ancient<00:01:13.360> times<00:01:13.830> humans

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
I found out that in ancient times humans

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.340 
I found out that in ancient times humans
use<00:01:15.070> their<00:01:15.280> teeth<00:01:15.490> not<00:01:15.790> only<00:01:16.090> for<00:01:16.360> eating<00:01:16.840> but

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
use their teeth not only for eating but

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.200 
use their teeth not only for eating but
they<00:01:17.440> were<00:01:17.560> also<00:01:17.770> using<00:01:18.220> them<00:01:18.340> as<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.460> tool<00:01:18.700> for

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
they were also using them as a tool for

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.850 
they were also using them as a tool for
example<00:01:19.300> they<00:01:19.780> will<00:01:19.930> use<00:01:20.140> their<00:01:20.380> teeth<00:01:20.590> to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
example they will use their teeth to

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.210 
example they will use their teeth to
peel<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.760> bark<00:01:22.480> of<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.810> branches<00:01:23.410> of<00:01:23.440> trees

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
peel the bark of the branches of trees

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.420 
peel the bark of the branches of trees
for<00:01:25.180> whatever<00:01:25.480> reason<00:01:26.020> their<00:01:26.650> food<00:01:26.950> was<00:01:27.130> much

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
for whatever reason their food was much

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.360 
for whatever reason their food was much
harder<00:01:28.060> harder<00:01:28.810> than<00:01:29.080> ours<00:01:29.530> today<00:01:29.830> they<00:01:30.190> had

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
harder harder than ours today they had

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.430 
harder harder than ours today they had
to<00:01:30.490> crack<00:01:30.760> nuts<00:01:31.120> and<00:01:31.570> seeds<00:01:31.930> with<00:01:32.170> their<00:01:32.290> own

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
to crack nuts and seeds with their own

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.820 
to crack nuts and seeds with their own
teeth<00:01:33.510> then<00:01:34.510> they<00:01:34.840> didn't<00:01:35.080> have<00:01:35.200> any<00:01:35.320> graders

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
teeth then they didn't have any graders

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.370 
teeth then they didn't have any graders
they<00:01:36.340> didn't<00:01:36.790> eat<00:01:36.910> heavily<00:01:37.540> processed<00:01:37.750> food

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
they didn't eat heavily processed food

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.650 
they didn't eat heavily processed food
and<00:01:38.590> our<00:01:39.010> food<00:01:39.340> today<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.180> heavily

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
and our food today is so heavily

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.250 
and our food today is so heavily
processed<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.040> refined<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:43.660> don't<00:01:43.960> have

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
processed so refined that we don't have

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.280 
processed so refined that we don't have
any<00:01:44.580> exercises<00:01:45.580> for<00:01:45.880> our<00:01:46.030> teeth<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.810> our<00:01:46.930> jaws

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
any exercises for our teeth and our jaws

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.680 
any exercises for our teeth and our jaws
anymore<00:01:47.920> due<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.280> chronic<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.760> lack<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.210> chewing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
anymore due to chronic a lack of chewing

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.940 
anymore due to chronic a lack of chewing
our<00:01:50.230> bone<00:01:51.130> density<00:01:51.480> decreased<00:01:52.480> and<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.740> whole

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
our bone density decreased and the whole

our bone density decreased and the whole
structure<00:01:54.400> of<00:01:54.670> our<00:01:54.730> jaw<00:01:55.090> changed<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.750> such<00:01:55.930> a

structure of our jaw changed to such a
degree<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.590> now<00:01:57.160> we<00:01:57.220> have<00:01:57.730> very<00:01:57.970> narrow<00:01:58.330> jaw

degree that now we have very narrow jaw
our<00:01:59.230> jaws<00:01:59.800> are<00:01:59.980> so<00:02:00.190> narrow<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.610> today's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
narrow jaw and I started to think how

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.840 
narrow jaw and I started to think how
can<00:02:12.130> we<00:02:12.280> exercise<00:02:12.880> our

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
can we exercise our

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.060 
can we exercise our
I<00:02:13.880> made<00:02:14.480> research<00:02:14.900> about<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.440> connection<00:02:15.920> of

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
I made research about the connection of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.810 
I made research about the connection of
bone<00:02:16.430> density<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.470> exercising<00:02:18.470> for<00:02:19.340> example

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
bone density and exercising for example

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.330 
bone density and exercising for example
in<00:02:20.000> tennis<00:02:20.450> players<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.470> dominant<00:02:22.010> playing

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
in tennis players the dominant playing

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.510 
in tennis players the dominant playing
arm<00:02:22.670> has<00:02:22.940> 40%<00:02:23.360> more<00:02:23.960> bone<00:02:24.260> density<00:02:24.950> than<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
arm has 40% more bone density than the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.570 
arm has 40% more bone density than the
one<00:02:25.820> they<00:02:26.120> use<00:02:26.360> with<00:02:26.600> us<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:28.100> what<00:02:28.370> about

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
one they use with us and what about

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.150 
one they use with us and what about
teeth<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:29.090> don't<00:02:29.270> really<00:02:29.630> exercise<00:02:30.260> them<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.130> I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
teeth we don't really exercise them so I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.760 
teeth we don't really exercise them so I
started<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.910> think<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.300> how<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.960> we<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:33.290> jaw

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
started to think of how can we make jaw

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.400 
started to think of how can we make jaw
exercises<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:35.120> will<00:02:35.270> provide<00:02:35.660> resistance

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
exercises that will provide resistance

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.060 
exercises that will provide resistance
training<00:02:36.980> for<00:02:37.670> our<00:02:37.700> jaws<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.140> five<00:02:39.470> years<00:02:39.740> ago

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
training for our jaws so five years ago

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.540 
training for our jaws so five years ago
I<00:02:40.280> started<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.940> work<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.390> my<00:02:41.620> jxe<00:02:42.620> sizer<00:02:42.890> I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
I started to work on my jxe sizer I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.180 
I started to work on my jxe sizer I
spent<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.330> lot<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.540> time<00:02:44.960> trying<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.440> find<00:02:45.890> out

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
spent a lot of time trying to find out

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.430 
spent a lot of time trying to find out
the<00:02:46.400> perfect<00:02:46.640> shape<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.450> JX<00:02:47.870> ur<00:02:47.990> sizes<00:02:48.350> I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
the perfect shape for the JX ur sizes I

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.020 
the perfect shape for the JX ur sizes I
started<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.010> experiment<00:02:49.640> with<00:02:49.850> different

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
started to experiment with different

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.230 
started to experiment with different
textures<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.800> started<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.340> chew<00:02:52.670> different

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
textures and I started to chew different

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.200 
textures and I started to chew different
teething<00:02:53.720> toys<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.260> tried<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.520> my<00:02:55.700> mouth<00:02:55.940> every

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
teething toys I tried in my mouth every

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.110 
teething toys I tried in my mouth every
day<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.750> toy<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.110> came<00:02:57.440> across<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:58.250> found<00:02:58.790> out

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
day the toy I came across I found out

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.450 
day the toy I came across I found out
interesting<00:02:59.660> that<00:03:00.380> most<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:01.040> them<00:03:01.220> have

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
interesting that most of them have

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.000 
interesting that most of them have
horrible<00:03:01.820> taste<00:03:01.970> they<00:03:02.870> taste<00:03:03.170> very<00:03:03.440> toxic

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
horrible taste they taste very toxic

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.730 
horrible taste they taste very toxic
I<00:03:04.190> recommend<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.450> mothers<00:03:05.840> put<00:03:06.530> their

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
I recommend that all mothers put their

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.440 
I recommend that all mothers put their
teething<00:03:06.950> toys<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.520> their<00:03:07.640> own<00:03:07.790> mouths<00:03:08.030> before

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
teething toys in their own mouths before

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.390 
teething toys in their own mouths before
they<00:03:08.540> give<00:03:08.720> them<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.990> their<00:03:09.140> babies<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.220> I

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
they give them to their babies and I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.840 
they give them to their babies and I
tried<00:03:10.960> different<00:03:11.960> mouth<00:03:12.470> guards<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.430> all

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
tried different mouth guards and all

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.450 
tried different mouth guards and all
kinds<00:03:14.270> of<00:03:14.330> different<00:03:14.510> things<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.280> finally<00:03:16.280> I

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
kinds of different things and finally I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.180 
kinds of different things and finally I
came<00:03:16.790> up<00:03:17.000> with<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.660> shape<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.860> think

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
came up with the the shape that I think

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.620 
came up with the the shape that I think
works<00:03:19.490> for<00:03:19.790> everyone

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
works for everyone

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.160 
works for everyone
it<00:03:20.870> took<00:03:21.410> me<00:03:21.620> enormous<00:03:22.340> time<00:03:23.020> several<00:03:24.020> years

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
it took me enormous time several years

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.930 
it took me enormous time several years
to<00:03:24.740> find<00:03:24.980> good<00:03:25.220> material

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
to find good material

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.710 
to find good material
I<00:03:26.020> chose<00:03:27.020> silicon<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.070> natural<00:03:28.670> resin<00:03:29.180> these

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
I chose silicon and natural resin these

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.040 
I chose silicon and natural resin these
materials<00:03:30.320> are<00:03:30.530> entirely<00:03:30.980> non-toxic<00:03:32.050> my

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050

materials are entirely non-toxic my
gesture<00:03:33.470> size<00:03:33.710> it<00:03:33.860> has<00:03:33.890> perfect<00:03:34.280> resistance

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
gesture size it has perfect resistance

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.420 
gesture size it has perfect resistance
and<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.630> only<00:03:35.810> need<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.320> chew<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.680> 1<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.220> 2

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
and you only need to chew it 1 to 2

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.340 
and you only need to chew it 1 to 2
minutes<00:03:37.790> per<00:03:38.000> day<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.600> increase<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.170> bone

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
minutes per day to increase the bone

decay due to chronic lack of chew and

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.420 
decay due to chronic lack of chew and
most<00:03:50.060> people<00:03:50.600> have<00:03:50.870> this<00:03:51.190> celebrate<00:03:52.190> glands

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
most people have this celebrate glands

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.900 
most people have this celebrate glands
shrunk<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:54.860> when<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.160> begin<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.460> chew

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
shrunk and so when you begin to chew

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.180 
shrunk and so when you begin to chew
exerciser<00:03:56.690> you'll<00:03:57.110> notice<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.710> you'll<00:03:57.920> have
