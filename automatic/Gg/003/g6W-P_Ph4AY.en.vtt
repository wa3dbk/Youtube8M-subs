hey youtube this is brant page here with
the<00:00:02.610> deck<00:00:02.850> profile<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.389> elemental<00:00:04.049> dragon<00:00:04.380> hi

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
the deck profile on elemental dragon hi

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.390 
the deck profile on elemental dragon hi
radix<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:05.790> deck<00:00:06.000> top<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.450> regionals<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.109> so

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
radix this deck top the regionals and so

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.799 
radix this deck top the regionals and so
obviously<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.389> top<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.750> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
obviously I was right on top of it and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.640 
obviously I was right on top of it and
made<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.800> deck<00:00:11.309> without<00:00:11.429> my<00:00:11.700> own<00:00:11.820> build

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
made a deck without my own build

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.780 
made a deck without my own build
unfortunately<00:00:13.650> there<00:00:13.980> I've<00:00:14.130> actually<00:00:14.309> seen

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
unfortunately there I've actually seen

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.200 
unfortunately there I've actually seen
one<00:00:15.080> total<00:00:16.080> video<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.550> deck<00:00:17.789> profile

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
one total video of that deck profile

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.460 
one total video of that deck profile
that<00:00:19.140> talked<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.640> try<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:21.869> deck<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that talked so I try to make my deck I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.349 
that talked so I try to make my deck I
basically<00:00:23.160> kind<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.400> net<00:00:23.580> deck<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> change<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
basically kind of net deck to change it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.570 
basically kind of net deck to change it
up<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.930> fit<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.230> own<00:00:25.380> preferences<00:00:25.890> that's<00:00:26.460> what

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
up to fit my own preferences that's what

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.730 
up to fit my own preferences that's what
a<00:00:26.609> lot<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.760> people<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.090> feed<00:00:27.269> sex<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.019> most<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
a lot of people to feed sex but most of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.140 
a lot of people to feed sex but most of
the<00:00:28.800> reason<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.939> guys

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the reason I do this is that you guys

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
the reason I do this is that you guys
can<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.960> good<00:00:31.650> idea<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:32.279> what

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
can actually get a good idea of what

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060 
can actually get a good idea of what
here<00:00:32.940> um<00:00:33.149> r<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.989> i<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.380> i<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.770> his

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
here um r and i think i have all his

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.360 
here um r and i think i have all his
cards<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:37.170> Sean<00:00:37.829> Medina

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
cards here that is like Sean Medina

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.860 
cards here that is like Sean Medina
played<00:00:38.700> save<00:00:39.540> his<00:00:40.070> vanities<00:00:41.070> emptiness<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870

played save his vanities emptiness so to
go<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> deck<00:00:43.290> profile<00:00:43.700> playing<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.030> set<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
go to the deck profile playing a set of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.420 
go to the deck profile playing a set of
all<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> high<00:00:46.829> radix<00:00:48.530> 323<00:00:49.910> su3<00:00:51.140> sa3<00:00:52.140> nap<00:00:52.320> set

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.680 

then<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> play<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:57.180> Tempest<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:59.510> this<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
then I play through Tempest I this is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.880 
then I play through Tempest I this is
the<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> plate<00:01:01.710> all

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the only one actually going to plate all

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.370 
the only one actually going to plate all
set<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.430> nope<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.470> ones<00:01:04.680> no<00:01:04.979> Noah

title<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.250> blaster<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.510> redox

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
title just to blaster and to redox

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.230 
title just to blaster and to redox
because<00:01:10.020> tempest<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.520> best<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
because tempest is like the best one and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
because tempest is like the best one and
I<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> most<00:01:12.540> targets<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:14.250> then

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I have the most targets and then

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
I have the most targets and then
blasters<00:01:15.150> nostril<00:01:15.540> popping<00:01:15.869> ability<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
blasters nostril popping ability and the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.140 
blasters nostril popping ability and the
redox<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.430> prefer<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> read<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.000> mobility

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
redox is I prefer to read more mobility

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
redox is I prefer to read more mobility
but<00:01:18.750> three<00:01:19.200> will<00:01:19.710> become<00:01:20.009> cloggy<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> then

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
but three will become cloggy and then

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.210 
but three will become cloggy and then
one<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.490> item<00:01:23.670> D<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:24.900> normals<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.979> luster

parrot I could place over it Perry

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
parrot I could place over it Perry
dragon<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.400> basically<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> exact<00:01:33.329> same<00:01:33.570> thing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
