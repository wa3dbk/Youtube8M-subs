they<00:04:12.340> have<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.790> pick<00:04:12.970> themselves<00:04:13.209> up<00:04:13.569> after

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
they have to pick themselves up after

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.270 
they have to pick themselves up after
that<00:04:14.349> disappointing<00:04:15.190> defeat<00:04:16.889> we<00:04:17.889> can<00:04:18.010> go<00:04:18.160> out

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
that disappointing defeat we can go out

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.860 
that disappointing defeat we can go out
saying<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.090> we<00:04:19.239> give<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> hundred<00:04:19.690> percent

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
saying that we give a hundred percent

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.350 
saying that we give a hundred percent
and<00:04:20.440> that's<00:04:21.010> when<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> cast<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.669> us<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:22.240> do

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
and that's when the cast of us to do

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.700 
and that's when the cast of us to do
before<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> game<00:04:22.840> was<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:23.290> we<00:04:23.320> can<00:04:23.590> give

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
before the game was if we can give

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.590 
before the game was if we can give
everything<00:04:23.980> we<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.760> think<00:04:25.150> we<00:04:25.210> did<00:04:25.389> and

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
everything we can and I think we did and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.080 
everything we can and I think we did and
I<00:04:25.840> think<00:04:26.530> Chelsea<00:04:27.220> know<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.639> they<00:04:28.030> were

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
I think Chelsea know that they were

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.670 
I think Chelsea know that they were
lucky<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.540> get<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.780> win<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.169> think<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.560> feel

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
lucky to get the win and I think we feel

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.770 
lucky to get the win and I think we feel
hard<00:04:29.980> done<00:04:30.040> by<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.550> think<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:31.510> know<00:04:31.630> we

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
hard done by and I think you know we

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.600 
hard done by and I think you know we
probably<00:04:32.350> could<00:04:32.680> have<00:04:32.710> won<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.190> game<00:04:33.220> and

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
probably could have won the game and

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.820 
probably could have won the game and
probably<00:04:34.419> should<00:04:34.600> have<00:04:34.750> but<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.530> know<00:04:35.620> that's

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
probably should have but you know that's

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.170 
probably should have but you know that's
football<00:04:36.010> fire<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.610> win<00:04:36.820> some<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.060> lose

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
football fire and you win some you lose

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.330 
football fire and you win some you lose
some<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.690> unfortunately<00:04:38.260> lost<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.800> without

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
some and unfortunately lost and without

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.280 
some and unfortunately lost and without
but<00:04:39.669> we<00:04:39.880> got<00:04:40.060> another<00:04:40.240> focus<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.780> come<00:04:40.960> which

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
but we got another focus to come which

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.469 
but we got another focus to come which
is<00:04:41.440> sunday<00:04:41.700> does<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.850> some<00:04:43.060> may<00:04:43.180> give<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.450> a

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
is sunday does it some may give you a

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.060 
is sunday does it some may give you a
chance<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.930> put<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.139> right<00:04:44.290> yeah<00:04:44.950> because

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
chance to put it right yeah because

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.620 
chance to put it right yeah because
there's<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.370> chance<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.760> redeem<00:04:45.880> ourselves<00:04:46.180> and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
there's a chance to redeem ourselves and

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.450 
there's a chance to redeem ourselves and
actually<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.770> know<00:04:47.889> we're<00:04:48.070> probably

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
actually you know we're probably

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.040 
actually you know we're probably
dominate<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.060> teams<00:04:49.240> of<00:04:49.389> possession<00:04:49.930> but

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
dominate in teams of possession but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.990 
dominate in teams of possession but
they're<00:04:50.770> taking<00:04:51.010> their<00:04:51.250> chances<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:51.820> think

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
they're taking their chances and I think

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.180 
they're taking their chances and I think
now<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.330> have<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.810> take<00:04:52.960> hours<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.590> think

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
now we have to take hours and I think

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.700 
now we have to take hours and I think
one<00:04:54.940> more<00:04:55.090> incentive<00:04:55.600> do<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:55.750> have<00:04:55.930> them<00:04:56.200> to

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
one more incentive do you have them to

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.590 
one more incentive do you have them to
you<00:04:57.130> know<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.490> win<00:04:57.639> Sunday<00:04:58.000> because<00:04:58.270> they

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
you know to win Sunday because they

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.270 
you know to win Sunday because they
knocked<00:04:58.780> us<00:04:58.870> out<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.110> FA<00:04:59.290> Cup<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.680> i<00:04:59.860> think

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
knocked us out the FA Cup so i think

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.860 
knocked us out the FA Cup so i think
we'll<00:05:00.669> come<00:05:01.090> strong<00:05:01.330> with<00:05:01.510> them<00:05:01.660> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
we'll come strong with them and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.820 
we'll come strong with them and
hopefully<00:05:02.200> we'll<00:05:02.530> win<00:05:04.530> well<00:05:05.530> don't<00:05:05.680> forget
