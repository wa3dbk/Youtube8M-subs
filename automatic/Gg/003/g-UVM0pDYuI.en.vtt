00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 April received e-mails notifying that

 Rick Fried would be replacing punk 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.300
 there was no explanation in the mail 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.039
 so you see that the wwf one is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.340
 commenting on the punk situation 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.829
 openly fans have the option 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.469
 of receiving a refund change your 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.240

 john dinner has been training with 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.650
 Antonio Caesar at the performance center 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.740
 in Orlando today, the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.870
 Officials of the WW are angry with 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.570
 the reaction that the public had in the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.090
 return of batista when the officers 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.760
 they saw the increase in the ranking they decided 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.130
 that it was not the batista's fault they 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.280
 blame the dayton fans today 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.480
 the feeling right now is that dayton 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.150
 will not have a ppcv in a long time 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.760
 the creatives of the ww are shuffling 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.640
 several options of face hours lehman and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.100
 a-30 one of them is that daniel gollan 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.369
 fight against triple hy if bryant wins 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.440
 I would have an opportunity to ww edward 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.560
 davey weight in extreme rules en se 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.310
 speak chinese yan finally fight against 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.830
 triple H 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.800
 'germany we would have a fight 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.950
 against cane dinner against goliath and batista 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.770
 against orton for the title another option 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.930
 is that dinner is against triple h 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.940
 we are against rail we are and ottÃ³n 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.890
 I would have to fight in a triple threat 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.440
 against 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.900
 batista another option would be to put to be 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.150
 against triple h continue with the triple 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.390
 threat for the title and unit against 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.520
 dinner randy orton is very 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.500
 angry with the public of the royal rumble 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.450
 after no attention was paid to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.360
 combat during any time of the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.700
 fight in a new column of jim ross 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.210
 in his personal blog the hall of famer 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.880
 commented on several current issues 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.330
 below the highlights about the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.610
 cmp output I fully understand that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.890
 bread that is exhausted and frustrated but 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.830
 personally and maybe in a way 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.140
 selfish wish that this is not Germany 30 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.740
 and the show breaks before leaving and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.010
 recharge your batteries the speaker is the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.770
 fan of me about a possible return of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.780
 Lesnar at UFC can see why 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.390
 You would love to go back to 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.700
 fighting in ufc is a beast that feels 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.390
 that has left things unresolved and is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.090
 healthy finally I think the ex 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.730
 nc champion 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.890
 ww 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.599
 efe has nothing to prove in the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.610
 eighth already has a great arrangement in ww 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.000
 working part time which I think 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.180
 which is a significant amount of money 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.110
 and I'm a huge fan of ufc lesnar sells 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.150
 pv when it is hot depends on the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.269
 wwf get lesnar is hot 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.280
 between now and April 6 I could see 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.790
 easily to lesnar to challenge the undertaker 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.400
 and the streak in gurb sleman and 31 and leave 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.590
 let this matter grow for a year 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.160
 lesnar gets reborn as a beast 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.319
 and be the most intense threat to the streak 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.260
 just a thought 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.540
 also jrr confirmed that stone cold steve 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.400
 Austin will be your first guest in your 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.849
 podcast in a couple of weeks 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.659
 I just say goodbye to you and even the 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.659
 next video
