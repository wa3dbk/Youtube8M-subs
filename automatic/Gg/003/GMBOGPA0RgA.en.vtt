challenges<00:01:54.210> were<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> big<00:01:54.720> part<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.700> 2013<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
challenges were a big part of 2013 so I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.649 
challenges were a big part of 2013 so I
wasn't<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> shotgun<00:02:00.210> rank

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
wasn't really going for the shotgun rank

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.980 
wasn't really going for the shotgun rank
but<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.820> came<00:02:03.090> anyway

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
but it kind of you know it came anyway

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.429 
but it kind of you know it came anyway
so<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.439> wasn't<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.740> hard<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439
