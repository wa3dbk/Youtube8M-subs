open<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:26.660> here<00:02:27.660> I'm<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.319> have<00:02:28.440> to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
open and here I'm going to have to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
open and here I'm going to have to
explain<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.370> guys<00:02:29.519> maybe<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
explain this to you guys maybe this is a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.369 
explain this to you guys maybe this is a
better<00:02:30.750> shot<00:02:31.019> here<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:33.030> outer<00:02:33.330> sort<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> skin

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
better shot here the outer sort of skin

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.920 
better shot here the outer sort of skin
here<00:02:34.799> is<00:02:34.860> where<00:02:35.340> most<00:02:35.730> well<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.510> lot<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
here is where most well a lot of the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.750 
here is where most well a lot of the
heat<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.349> but<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.620> majority<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.310> heat<00:02:38.549> is

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
heat is but the majority of heat is

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.089 
heat is but the majority of heat is
within<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.660> area<00:02:39.989> here<00:02:40.440> where<00:02:40.590> those<00:02:40.739> seeds

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
within this area here where those seeds

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.520 
within this area here where those seeds
are<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.970> sort<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.360> white<00:02:42.660> membrane<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
are this sort of white membrane that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.430 
are this sort of white membrane that
surrounds<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.280> seed<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:45.299> if<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:46.049> some

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
surrounds the seed so if you want some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.650 
surrounds the seed so if you want some
of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> heat<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.190> all<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.670> heat<00:02:47.880> what<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
of the heat not all of the heat what you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.460 
of the heat not all of the heat what you
would<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:50.299> would<00:02:51.299> simply<00:02:51.810> take<00:02:52.049> some<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
would do you would simply take some of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.890 
would do you would simply take some of
the<00:02:52.799> outer<00:02:53.220> skin<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:54.120> or<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.299> flesh<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the outer skin here or the flesh of the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.140 
the outer skin here or the flesh of the
pepper<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.410> use<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.250> now<00:02:56.489> how<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
pepper and use that now how are you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.369 
pepper and use that now how are you
going<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.299> control<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> heat<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.170> by<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
going to control the heat is by the

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.020 
going to control the heat is by the
amount<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.040> outside<00:02:59.459> skin<00:02:59.819> you're<00:03:00.000> going

not sure if you can see it but there's
some<00:03:30.030> oils<00:03:30.389> I<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.599> already<00:03:30.810> see<00:03:31.139> by<00:03:31.260> moving

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
some oils I can already see by moving

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.930 
some oils I can already see by moving
around<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.099> here<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.840> again<00:03:34.609> you<00:03:35.609> want<00:03:35.880> the
