00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
first bought them they are really really

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
first bought them they are really really
slippery<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.189> extremely<00:01:38.759> slippery<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
slippery like extremely slippery so I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.380 
slippery like extremely slippery so I
put<00:01:40.110> double<00:01:40.409> sided<00:01:40.650> foam<00:01:41.579> tape<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> bottom

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
put double sided foam tape on the bottom

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.139 
put double sided foam tape on the bottom
which<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.610> any<00:01:44.700> left<00:01:45.000> i

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
which I don't know if I have any left i

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.819 
which I don't know if I have any left i
think<00:01:45.329> i<00:01:45.420> use<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> rest<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> i<00:01:46.290> would

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
think i use the rest of it i would

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.020 
think i use the rest of it i would
recommend<00:01:47.250> getting<00:01:47.340> something<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> put<00:01:48.000> on

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
recommend getting something to put on

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
recommend getting something to put on
the<00:01:48.149> bottom<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.750> grip<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> bottom<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the bottom to grip the bottom to the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.200 
the bottom to grip the bottom to the
ground<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:50.850> slippery

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
ground because they are really slippery

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620
