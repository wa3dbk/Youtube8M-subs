at him being in feature films but the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.960 
at him being in feature films but the
other<00:04:42.680> thing<00:04:42.889> I<00:04:43.009> liked<00:04:43.190> about<00:04:43.280> this<00:04:43.550> trailer

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
other thing I liked about this trailer

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.640 
other thing I liked about this trailer
is<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> think<00:04:44.870> it's<00:04:44.990> done<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.259> best<00:04:45.470> job

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
is that I think it's done the best job

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.520 
is that I think it's done the best job
actually<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:46.550> far<00:04:46.850> on<00:04:47.120> selling<00:04:47.870> this<00:04:47.990> film<00:04:48.289> on

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
actually so far on selling this film on

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.320 
actually so far on selling this film on
the<00:04:48.650> true<00:04:48.889> story<00:04:48.919> rather<00:04:49.669> than<00:04:49.820> depths

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
the true story rather than depths

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.719 
the true story rather than depths
performance<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.259> that's<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.949> incredible

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
performance and that's the incredible

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.939 
performance and that's the incredible
situation<00:04:52.940> where<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.630> have<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.810> gangster<00:04:54.530> who

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
situation where you have a gangster who

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.909 
situation where you have a gangster who
has<00:04:55.099> a<00:04:55.130> connection<00:04:55.580> at<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.389> FBI<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.320> in<00:04:57.800> the

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
has a connection at the FBI and in the

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.770 
has a connection at the FBI and in the
ethic<00:04:58.250> government<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.180> government

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
ethic government and in the government

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.360 
ethic government and in the government
and<00:04:59.870> you're<00:05:00.020> like<00:05:00.199> how<00:05:00.680> did<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.919> take<00:05:01.130> so<00:05:01.160> long

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
and you're like how did it take so long

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.070 
and you're like how did it take so long
for<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.210> government<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:02.840> law<00:05:02.960> enforcement

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
for the government and law enforcement

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.659 
for the government and law enforcement
to<00:05:03.620> figure<00:05:03.949> out<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.310> he<00:05:04.400> have<00:05:04.520> these

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
to figure out that he have these

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.670 
to figure out that he have these
ridiculous<00:05:05.389> connections<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.229> mean<00:05:06.380> that's<00:05:06.500> a

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
ridiculous connections I mean that's a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.730 
ridiculous connections I mean that's a
very<00:05:07.099> powerful<00:05:08.020> Trinity<00:05:09.020> there<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:09.710> that

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
very powerful Trinity there so that

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.800 
very powerful Trinity there so that
makes<00:05:10.340> me<00:05:10.460> even<00:05:10.610> more<00:05:10.759> interested<00:05:11.479> in<00:05:11.660> the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
makes me even more interested in the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.870 
makes me even more interested in the
Whitey<00:05:12.020> Bulger<00:05:12.229> story<00:05:12.740> also<00:05:13.400> Whitey<00:05:13.699> Bulger

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880

let's see if they can add to that a

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.540 
let's see if they can add to that a
group<00:05:39.199> of<00:05:39.349> films<00:05:39.710> instead<00:05:40.130> of<00:05:40.159> just<00:05:40.370> your
