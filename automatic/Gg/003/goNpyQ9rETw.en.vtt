change<00:00:48.750> keys<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.620> usually<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
change keys they usually just take a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
change keys they usually just take a
dominant<00:00:50.940> seventh<00:00:51.180> chord<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.660> move<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
dominant seventh chord and they move it

up<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.260> couple<00:00:52.440> frets<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.219> how<00:00:53.370> they

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
up a couple frets and that's how they

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
up a couple frets and that's how they
change<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.969> key<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> most

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
