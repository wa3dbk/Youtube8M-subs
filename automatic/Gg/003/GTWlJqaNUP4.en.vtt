00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
there was a report that kind of got

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.920 
there was a report that kind of got
everybody<00:01:57.000> stirred<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.509> talking<00:01:57.780> about

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
everybody stirred I'm talking about

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.280 
everybody stirred I'm talking about
aliens<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.590> things<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.210> that<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.719> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
aliens and things like that that and so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.630 
aliens and things like that that and so
anyway<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> thought<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
anyway I thought that I would kind of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.670 
anyway I thought that I would kind of
bring<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.750> little<00:02:03.960> story<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.500> on

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
bring that one that little story and on

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.490 
bring that one that little story and on
this<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> crop<00:02:07.170> circle

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this one but there was a crop circle

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.990 
this one but there was a crop circle
that<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.399> put<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.940> field<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
that was put out in a field and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.580 
that was put out in a field and
california<00:02:10.660> i<00:02:10.720> think<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.050> showed<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.440> like

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
california i think this showed up like

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.720 
california i think this showed up like
on<00:02:11.770> december<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> 30th<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.900> was<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> really

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
on december the 30th and it was a really

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.570 
on december the 30th and it was a really
in-depth<00:02:15.730> intricate<00:02:16.420> design<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.140> know<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
in-depth intricate design you know and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.740 
in-depth intricate design you know and
you<00:02:18.580> know<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.880> course<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.270> have<00:02:19.390> people<00:02:19.570> who

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you know of course you have people who

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.600 
you know of course you have people who
claim<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.050> it's<00:02:20.410> aliens<00:02:21.010> trying<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.460> leave

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
claim that it's aliens trying to leave

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.680 
claim that it's aliens trying to leave
us<00:02:21.730> messages<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.920> know<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.760> UFOs<00:02:25.420> I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
us messages but you know I like UFOs I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300 
us messages but you know I like UFOs I
like<00:02:25.870> talking<00:02:26.140> about<00:02:26.320> aliens<00:02:26.770> but<00:02:26.950> I've<00:02:27.070> never

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
like talking about aliens but I've never

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.460 
like talking about aliens but I've never
understood<00:02:27.580> why<00:02:28.180> an<00:02:28.360> alien<00:02:28.750> would<00:02:28.990> leave<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
understood why an alien would leave a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.640 
understood why an alien would leave a
message<00:02:29.980> off<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.850> some<00:02:31.120> field<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.350> course

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
message off in some field and of course

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.770 
message off in some field and of course
you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.100> these<00:02:33.670> things<00:02:33.850> can<00:02:34.090> easily<00:02:34.570> be

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
you know that these things can easily be

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.710 
you know that these things can easily be
reproduced<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.100> man-made<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.209> they<00:02:37.450> show

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
reproduced and man-made and they show

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.550 
reproduced and man-made and they show
you<00:02:37.780> how<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.800> do<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> with<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.730> board<00:02:40.330> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you how you do it with just a board and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
you how you do it with just a board and
some<00:02:41.560> rope<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.580> know<00:02:42.700> flatten

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
some rope and you just you know flatten

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.630 
some rope and you just you know flatten
things<00:02:43.510> out<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.010> put<00:02:45.250> these<00:02:45.400> designs

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
things out and you can put these designs

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.020 
things out and you can put these designs
off<00:02:46.300> in<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.690> field<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.739> anyway<00:02:48.220> then

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
off in the field and so anyway then

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.670 
off in the field and so anyway then
there<00:02:49.420> were<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.690> kinds<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:50.080> people<00:02:50.200> trying<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
decipher what this message was what this

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.970 
decipher what this message was what this
design<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:54.670> was<00:02:54.790> even<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.510> newscast<00:02:56.260> who

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
design is there was even a newscast who

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.030 
design is there was even a newscast who
had<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.610> Braille<00:02:57.970> expert<00:02:58.750> come<00:02:59.050> on<00:02:59.260> who<00:02:59.770> they

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
had a Braille expert come on who they

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.520 
had a Braille expert come on who they
said<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.459> they<00:03:00.610> found<00:03:00.850> words<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:01.959> letters

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
said that they found words or letters

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.210 
said that they found words or letters
and<00:03:02.890> numbers<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.820> was<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.630> design<00:03:05.220> well

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and numbers that was in this design well

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.270 
and numbers that was in this design well
it<00:03:06.489> turns<00:03:06.550> out<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.480> was<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:07.930> a

showcase that is happening later this
week<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.150> Nvidia<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:17.200> was<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.769> Tegra<00:03:18.340> 4

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
week so Nvidia that was the Tegra 4

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.880 
week so Nvidia that was the Tegra 4
design<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.570> was<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.019> field<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.500> they

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
design that was in the field and they

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.300 
design that was in the field and they
are<00:03:20.920> getting<00:03:21.220> ready<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.610> unveil<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.930> latest

mystery and and one item that we
definitely<00:03:33.820> know<00:03:33.970> was<00:03:34.600> just<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.470> fake<00:03:35.769> soap<00:03:36.250> us

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
that doesn't for me the red dragon I'll
