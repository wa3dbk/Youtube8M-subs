jaelen strong which caused some problems

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730 
jaelen strong which caused some problems
but<00:01:41.430> utah<00:01:42.420> also<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.380> defense

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
but utah also was a very good defense

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.520 
but utah also was a very good defense
they<00:01:43.979> were<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.340> were<00:01:44.399> getting<00:01:45.090> pressure<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
they were they were getting pressure and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.620 
they were they were getting pressure and
then<00:01:46.680> has<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> game<00:01:47.130> unfolded<00:01:47.759> utah<00:01:48.270> had<00:01:48.420> one

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
then has a game unfolded utah had one

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
then has a game unfolded utah had one
sack<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> first<00:01:49.290> half<00:01:49.470> second<00:01:50.430> half<00:01:50.579> they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
sack in the first half second half they

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.010 
sack in the first half second half they
did<00:01:50.880> much<00:01:51.030> better<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.509> came<00:01:51.659> into<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> game

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
did much better they came into the game

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
did much better they came into the game
leading<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.250> country<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.700> five<00:01:53.909> sacks<00:01:54.210> per

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
leading the country with five sacks per

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
leading the country with five sacks per
game<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.680> pressure<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.159> getting<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
game and a lot of pressure was getting a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
game and a lot of pressure was getting a
taylor<00:01:56.700> kelly<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.119> i<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> had

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
taylor kelly and i think that that had

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
taylor kelly and i think that that had
him<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> where<00:01:58.740> he<00:01:58.920> was<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.310> little<00:01:59.820> bit<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.060> edge

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
him to where he was a little bit on edge

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
him to where he was a little bit on edge
and<00:02:00.630> maybe<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.020> making<00:02:01.350> some<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> right

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and maybe not making some of the right

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.719 
and maybe not making some of the right
decisions<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> day<00:02:04.979> he

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
decisions but at the end of the day he

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.029 
decisions but at the end of the day he
had<00:02:05.909> some<00:02:06.149> nice<00:02:06.329> runs<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.530> their<00:02:07.829> last

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
had some nice runs on on their last

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
had some nice runs on on their last
drive<00:02:08.569> enabled<00:02:09.569> them<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.720> kind<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> into

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
drive enabled them to kind of get into

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.360 
drive enabled them to kind of get into
position<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
position and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.280 
position and
you<00:02:12.670> know<00:02:12.760> he<00:02:12.970> had<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.209> couple<00:02:13.569> big<00:02:13.780> throws<00:02:14.080> that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you know he had a couple big throws that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890 
you know he had a couple big throws that
he<00:02:14.409> made<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.340> he<00:02:15.909> did<00:02:16.330> enough<00:02:16.569> put<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
he made and and he did enough put it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.990 
he made and and he did enough put it
that<00:02:17.019> way<00:02:17.080> Chris<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:17.890> defense<00:02:18.670> has<00:02:18.849> made

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
that way Chris this defense has made

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.820 
that way Chris this defense has made
huge<00:02:19.209> strides<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.930> mean<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.440> look<00:02:20.620> at<00:02:20.709> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
huge strides I mean do you look at the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.680 
huge strides I mean do you look at the
UCLA<00:02:21.250> game<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.730> even<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:21.940> USC<00:02:22.330> game<00:02:22.360> they

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
UCLA game and even the USC game they

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.360 
UCLA game and even the USC game they
struggled<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.319> majority<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.980> game<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
struggled for a majority that game and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.710 
struggled for a majority that game and
it's<00:02:24.489> one<00:02:24.670> thing<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:24.940> be<00:02:25.060> good<00:02:25.420> against

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it's one thing to be good against

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720 
it's one thing to be good against
Stanford's<00:02:26.319> offense<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.099> Washington's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
Stanford's offense and Washington's

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.250 
Stanford's offense and Washington's
offense<00:02:28.150> both<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.629> struggled<00:02:29.079> this<00:02:29.200> season

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
offense both have struggled this season

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.410 
offense both have struggled this season
it's<00:02:29.920> another<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.370> be<00:02:30.459> good<00:02:30.610> against<00:02:30.940> its<00:02:31.060> utah

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's another to be good against its utah

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.990 
it's another to be good against its utah
offense<00:02:32.260> devonte<00:02:32.799> Booker's<00:02:33.190> been<00:02:33.370> one<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
offense devonte Booker's been one of the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.610 
offense devonte Booker's been one of the
best<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.299> not<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.450> best<00:02:34.569> running<00:02:35.019> back<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.319> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
best if not the best running back in the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.550 
best if not the best running back in the
pac-12<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.340> season<00:02:36.970> they<00:02:37.659> were<00:02:37.720> able<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.379> get

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
pac-12 this season they were able to get

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.740 
pac-12 this season they were able to get
it<00:02:38.739> done<00:02:38.980> today<00:02:39.340> at<00:02:39.610> defensively<00:02:40.120> once<00:02:40.450> again

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
it done today at defensively once again

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.149 
it done today at defensively once again
and<00:02:40.900> they<00:02:40.959> really<00:02:41.349> proved<00:02:41.620> something<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
and they really proved something to the

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.680 
and they really proved something to the
rest<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.489> conference<00:02:42.670> yeah<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.329> think<00:02:43.540> they

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
rest of the conference yeah I think they

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.780 
rest of the conference yeah I think they
really<00:02:43.930> made<00:02:44.140> Utah<00:02:44.739> one-dimensional<00:02:45.519> there

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
really made Utah one-dimensional there

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.099 
really made Utah one-dimensional there
was<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.090> really<00:02:46.329> nothing<00:02:46.690> there<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.019> the

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
was just really nothing there in the

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.860 
was just really nothing there in the
passing<00:02:47.560> game<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:48.640> loaded<00:02:49.030> up<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.150> Box<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
passing game they loaded up the Box a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.599 
passing game they loaded up the Box a
lot<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.319> outside<00:02:50.799> run<00:02:51.099> stuff<00:02:51.400> wasn't

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
lot of the outside run stuff wasn't

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.550 
lot of the outside run stuff wasn't
really<00:02:51.940> working<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.870> they<00:02:53.079> just<00:02:53.109> had<00:02:53.410> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
really working so they just had the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.039 
really working so they just had the
pound<00:02:53.799> pound<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.370> ball<00:02:54.489> inside<00:02:54.910> with<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.870> just

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
pound pound the ball inside with it just

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.899 
pound pound the ball inside with it just
wasn't<00:02:56.319> enough<00:02:56.410> he's<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.099> great<00:02:57.370> player<00:02:57.519> he<00:02:57.640> was

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
wasn't enough he's a great player he was

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.880 
wasn't enough he's a great player he was
getting<00:02:58.180> yards<00:02:58.299> after<00:02:58.569> contact<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.769> they

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
getting yards after contact but they

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.559 
getting yards after contact but they
still<00:03:00.129> were<00:03:00.250> facing<00:03:00.489> second<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.269> medium

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
still were facing second and medium

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.960 
still were facing second and medium
second<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.959> long<00:03:02.049> third<00:03:02.530> medium<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
second and long third medium and you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.729 
second and long third medium and you
just<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.239> hard<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.750> sustain<00:03:04.900> drives<00:03:05.290> when

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
just it's hard to sustain drives when

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.440 
just it's hard to sustain drives when
you<00:03:05.829> don't<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.489> other<00:03:06.640> element<00:03:07.150> to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
you don't have that other element to

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.569 
you don't have that other element to
your<00:03:07.480> game<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.140> they<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.190> weren't<00:03:09.310> able<00:03:09.430> to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
your game and they just weren't able to

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.490 
your game and they just weren't able to
put<00:03:09.730> enough<00:03:09.909> points<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.329> board<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:11.140> you

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
put enough points on the board and you
