00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.369
 the scourge of heat has transformed the rivers of the basin, rivers of stones 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.249
 but with the arrival of the night the family of horsemen can go by 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.249
 end to drink in one of the few puddles that have been 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.300
 the two brothers with the hairs of the tail and the back bristling with excitement 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
 they are convinced to succeed tonight 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.380
 they want to learn by looking at everything 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.760
 they want to register in their brains sounds colors and shapes that will exercise 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.980
 the curiosity from which their predatory reflexes are born 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.710
 although the first thing is to know how to choose their prey 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.580
 as long as he can trace with more passion than delicacy his mother monitor the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.700
 reckless movements aware of the risk they run if the eagle owl was 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 another butcher bigger than them will hear so much fuss 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.800
 When you see that you have exhausted yourself enough, it is time to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.070
 instill a more serious lesson in hunting techniques 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.650
 the small safari in practices patrol the zone looking for some piece 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 but this time is not willing to be the trophy that anyone 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.500
 He took advantage of his knowledge of the terrain so that not even the expert 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.949
 mother is able to reach you in these circumstances 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.709
 without the surprise factor is too fast for her the puppies never 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 they will know if that shadow was edible 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.629
 already in his burrow the field mouse have also to whom to take care 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.860
 Take advantage of your premature arrival to breastfeed your children while you wait 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.859
 that things calm down out there 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.309
 being at the base of the ecological pyramid is not easy demands not having 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:54.259
 fear for that past the danger is done again to continue feeding being 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.979
 but even the efforts of a matrix have a limit 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.019
 kaos 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:21.569
 exhausted after the breeding season adult people have already given their puppies all 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.419
 what could 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.419
 and he missed his independence from Kosovo by 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.879
 after a hand that they stay still inside the burrow 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:39.349
 but the disobedience that his children see makes him make a decision 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 the time has come to leave us alone
