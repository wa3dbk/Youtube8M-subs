00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello welcome this is jose to create 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 my website this time I bring you a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.440
 new video and it's the analysis of the iphone 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.050
 5 although it has a few months of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.150
 I went to the market and decided to make a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.939
 analysis because it is one of the most 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 currently sold in the market to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.269
 world level and as you can see is by 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.600
 something because it uses a very design 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.050
 unique and the material used is aluminum 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.060
 and glass which gives it a very 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.580
 Elegant 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.360
 it is 18% thinner and 20% lighter 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.370
 compared to the previous iphone in what 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.410
 which is the bottom part one of the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.040
 differences is that it uses the new connector 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.930
 lighting that is 80% smaller than the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.600
 previous has its connection here 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.510
 Hearing aids your speakers here you can 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.730
 load with the new technology in the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.490
 part above we have what is the 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.050
 button on and off here we have 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.630
 the camera with its microphone and here in this 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.360
 side we have a specific button to 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.690
 turn off the sound as your controllers 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.180
 up and down as you can see is a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.390
 very beautiful design the main camera 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.330
 is it records videos up to 1080 high 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.330
 definition flash clues and here we have 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.300
 logo to the connection 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.240
 internet is super fast and that's because 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.900
 to which uses the new technology lte and the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.840
 which will give you access to telephone networks 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.450
 much better speed in regards 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 to the internet all this is possible with 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.110
 a new a6 processor that gives us a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.250
 performance up to double that the a5 and 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.210
 is the one that used the previous iphone 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.120
 graphics are faster battery 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.149
 should last around 8 hours for 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.460
 talk and 10 if you're watching only videos 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.830
 in the short time that I used this 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.980
 phone has noticed that the battery the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.030
 performance is similar to that of the iphone 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.030
 previous there is no impressive improvement 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 the screen is bigger is 4 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.240
 inches and it offers us 326 pixels per 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.760
 inch what we produce a 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.370
 incredible resolution here we can 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.550
 compare what a pen like 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.250
 you can see it's very thin and I like that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.260
 a lot besides that is very light as 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.080
 I mentioned you previously does not feel 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.600
 much in what is the hand in the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.760
 question of games reading 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.280
 images will look much better and that's 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.739
 due to the retina screen that has 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.130
 something that I should mention is that the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.980
 hearing aids have changed them and they feel 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.070
 better in the ears and more secure 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.400
 sound of them is better by making them very 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.019
 attractive and of better quality 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.660
 in regards to what is the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.640
 operating system has not suffered many 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.819
 changes if you are an iphone user 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.290
 you will see many differences the difference 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.950
 you will see it in the performance 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.380
 and speed with which you do your homework 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.380
 the new camera offers us the option of 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.800
 take photos 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.450
 panorama which is very useful also in 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.980
 the recording of videos in high 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.680
 definition 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.840
 it is better because it uses a new 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 stabilizer and here we have some 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.030
 example photos as you can notice for 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.370
 that you see the quality it takes and the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.590
 approach that you have is very fast just 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.080
 you touch the part you want where you focus 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.570
 the camera and it's pretty good that 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.090
 you liked it a lot here you have a video on high 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.290
 definition how can you see the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.680
 stabilizer if it works and gives us a 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.020
 better video as you can also notice the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.900
 approach that you have is very good when 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.140
 you are focusing on a specific area of 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.320
 your video in conclusion this is a very 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.170
 good phone and I see the reason why 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.840
 It is one of the best sellers and it is because of 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.960
 that has enough features that 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.389
 they make it unique in both performance 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.969
 as in the part of the physical design 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.249
 leave me your comments and tell me what 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.830

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.650
 if you like it or you do not like it or what 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.529
