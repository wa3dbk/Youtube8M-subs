one piece of fabric here this one and I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.850 
one piece of fabric here this one and I

was too lazy to cut this one and cut

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.660 
was too lazy to cut this one and cut
this<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.189> lay<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.420> fuzzy<00:01:24.900> brown

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670

fabric on top of this one and just sewed
it<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.770> top<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.820> fabric<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.509> doubled

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

grosgrain<00:01:45.140> ribbon<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.119> hides<00:01:47.450> anything

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
grosgrain ribbon so it hides anything

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.850 
grosgrain ribbon so it hides anything

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.730 
you can see I was really careful here
and<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.640> carefully<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:08.959> anyway<00:03:09.440> most

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
and not so carefully but anyway most

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.790 
and not so carefully but anyway most
people<00:03:10.100> aren't<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.610> look<00:03:10.760> back<00:03:11.000> closely

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
people aren't going to look back closely

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.860 
people aren't going to look back closely
so<00:03:12.800> these<00:03:13.490> are<00:03:13.640> my<00:03:13.790> indoor<00:03:14.120> shoes<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.540> don't

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
so these are my indoor shoes you don't

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.840 
so these are my indoor shoes you don't
look<00:03:15.050> at<00:03:15.170> them<00:03:15.709> too<00:03:15.920> closely<00:03:16.160> I've<00:03:16.430> used<00:03:16.700> them

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
look at them too closely I've used them

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.830 
look at them too closely I've used them
a<00:03:17.030> bit<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:17.600> they're<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> bit<00:03:17.930> dirty<00:03:18.260> um<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:20.209> didn't

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
a bit so they're a bit dirty um I didn't

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.380 
a bit so they're a bit dirty um I didn't
decorate<00:03:21.260> these<00:03:21.560> they<00:03:22.550> were<00:03:22.610> given<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.180> me<00:03:23.209> by

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
decorate these they were given to me by

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.050 
decorate these they were given to me by
my<00:03:24.110> sister-in-law<00:03:24.739> who<00:03:25.069> lives<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.459> Korea<00:03:25.640> but

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
my sister-in-law who lives in Korea but

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.699 
my sister-in-law who lives in Korea but
I<00:03:26.090> think<00:03:26.390> they<00:03:26.570> were<00:03:26.630> made<00:03:26.989> by<00:03:27.290> someone

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
I think they were made by someone

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.220 
I think they were made by someone
someone<00:03:28.520> just<00:03:28.730> took<00:03:28.910> this<00:03:29.120> frilly<00:03:29.540> material

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
someone just took this frilly material

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.220 
someone just took this frilly material
and<00:03:30.410> used<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> hot<00:03:31.340> glue<00:03:31.610> gun<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:32.150> pulled<00:03:33.080> it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and used the hot glue gun and pulled it

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.550 
and used the hot glue gun and pulled it
and<00:03:33.410> hot<00:03:33.680> glued<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.130> all<00:03:34.250> across<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:36.290> edge

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
and hot glued it all across this edge

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.620 
and hot glued it all across this edge
here<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:37.130> think<00:03:37.489> they<00:03:37.670> probably<00:03:37.880> used<00:03:38.450> some

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
here I think they probably used some

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.930 
here I think they probably used some
laundry<00:03:39.320> clips<00:03:39.590> or<00:03:39.830> something<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.310> secure<00:03:40.760> it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.469 
piece of fabric and put it around one of
the<00:04:50.830> loops<00:04:51.009> and<00:04:51.280> sew<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.699> onto<00:04:51.940> here

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
the loops and sew it onto here

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.839 
the loops and sew it onto here
so<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.199> fabric<00:04:53.740> will<00:04:53.889> connect<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.699> this

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
so a fabric will connect this to this

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.100 
so a fabric will connect this to this
part<00:04:55.919> I've<00:04:56.919> used<00:04:57.340> instead<00:04:57.880> here<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.449> little

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
part I've used instead here a little

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.560 
part I've used instead here a little
piece<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.440> brown<00:04:59.919> ribbon<00:05:00.400> which<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.120> fine<00:05:01.539> for

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
piece of brown ribbon which is fine for

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.450 
piece of brown ribbon which is fine for
adults<00:05:02.229> but<00:05:02.380> for<00:05:02.590> kids<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.949> think<00:05:03.009> you<00:05:03.220> want<00:05:03.430> to

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
adults but for kids I think you want to

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.839 
adults but for kids I think you want to
use<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:03.759> it's<00:05:04.000> tougher<00:05:04.449> and<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:05.470> was<00:05:05.849> four

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
use this it's tougher and this was four

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.010 
use this it's tougher and this was four
pieces<00:05:07.090> for<00:05:08.430> 189<00:05:09.430> yen<00:05:09.610> but<00:05:10.270> again<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.900> think

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
pieces for 189 yen but again I think

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.820 
pieces for 189 yen but again I think
this<00:05:11.380> is<00:05:11.440> available<00:05:12.070> at<00:05:12.250> dollar<00:05:12.520> shop<00:05:12.789> spaces

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
this is available at dollar shop spaces

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.290 
this is available at dollar shop spaces
and<00:05:14.830> because<00:05:15.729> my<00:05:16.000> handle<00:05:16.389> I've<00:05:16.570> used<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:18.580> piece

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
and because my handle I've used a piece

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.920 
and because my handle I've used a piece
of<00:05:19.330> grosgrain<00:05:19.780> ribbon<00:05:20.470> it's<00:05:21.130> kind<00:05:21.430> of<00:05:21.490> flimsy

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
of grosgrain ribbon it's kind of flimsy

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.740 
of grosgrain ribbon it's kind of flimsy
so<00:05:22.930> this<00:05:23.349> is<00:05:23.500> why<00:05:23.650> I<00:05:23.710> recommend<00:05:24.009> this<00:05:24.490> for<00:05:25.060> kids

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
so this is why I recommend this for kids

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.570 
so this is why I recommend this for kids
version<00:05:25.960> they're<00:05:26.320> gonna<00:05:26.500> be<00:05:26.680> using<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:27.159> maybe

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
version they're gonna be using it maybe

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.499 
version they're gonna be using it maybe
every<00:05:27.970> day<00:05:28.120> or<00:05:28.360> regularly<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.229> a<00:05:29.440> tougher<00:05:30.509> kind

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
every day or regularly so a tougher kind

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.170 
every day or regularly so a tougher kind
of<00:05:31.599> thicker<00:05:32.250> material<00:05:33.250> it's<00:05:33.460> decided<00:05:34.030> that

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
of thicker material it's decided that

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.990 
of thicker material it's decided that
this<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.539> my<00:05:34.720> own<00:05:34.840> shoe<00:05:35.139> bag<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.610> doesn't

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
this is my own shoe bag so it doesn't

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.400 
this is my own shoe bag so it doesn't
need<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.240> be<00:05:37.270> super<00:05:38.139> tough<00:05:38.289> or<00:05:38.500> fancy
