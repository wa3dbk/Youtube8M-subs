00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.420
 the orchards of Campania are in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.120
 danger a nuvo and insect up to this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.430
 moment unknown in europe it takes office 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.410
 in plants until death 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.640
 of the same 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.670
 the alarm comes from the service 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 plant health of the Campania region that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.899
 found outbreaks of the beetle 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.329
 in some areas of the province of Naples 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.329
 in particular in the Phlegraean area 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 globalization the opening of 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.960
 Borders makes our territory 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.540
 it is clearly becoming fertile ground 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 to stay on the subject also of this 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.110
 arrival of harmful microorganisms with the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750
 phytosanitary service of the region 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.120
 campania we are collaborating 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 continuously with the cnr however also 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.620
 directly with the faculties in order to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.470
 being able to identify microorganisms always 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.660
 not harmful to fight the same 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.880
 high attention to other tension 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.830
 because this clearly affects 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
 every single citizen in the ambit of the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 own vegetable garden but certainly prisons with 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.100
 products of important products for the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.190
 our agriculture but above all for the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.130
 our internal pil with abonji aromas 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.680
 this is the name of the parasite affects 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.490
 some types of trees like cherry 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.530
 the peach the apricot and the plum tree his 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.990
 presence occurs with holes in the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.050
 trees and traces of sawdust at the base 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.450
 of the trunk was observed that not 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.770
 only tree can live together anymore 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.770
 generations of larvae 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 this species certainly arrives 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.350
 from the Far East it is widespread in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.659
 china where the peach attacks 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.300
 be very harmful so much so that in 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.360
 china take numerous measures for 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.010
 to be able to control its population a 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.790
 roma a bucci is nothing more than a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.800
 ceramic beetle that therefore a 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.140
 This xylophagous behavior means 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.030
 which is practically the larva digs 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 tunnels in the trunk and in the big ones 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.250
 branches of trees and therefore 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.730
 ultimately it leads to death 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.760
 themselves so it is not so much affected the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.519
 production that is the fruit as it happens 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.150
 for many plant pests of plants from 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.010
 fruit 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 but it really puts the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:48.010
 survival of the entire plant la 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.690
 prevention is now essential in 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.540
 spring larvae could 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.940
 flicker proliferate and attack 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.810
 whole crops causing damage 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.720
 elevated to agriculture the adult co 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.900
 in fact fly for small distances 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.239
 it is also easily recognizable by 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.620
 its size and characteristic 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 red collar 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.180
 it is therefore necessary to recognize the cases 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.370
 suspects and report them directly to 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.829
 regional phytosanitary service for a 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.510
 first aid 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.140
 we close the collaboration from the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.950
 citizens and also municipalities and all 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.010
 the other local authorities so that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.340
 report cases to the phytosanitary service 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.680
 suspicion or presence 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.250
 of this insect of this had us 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.690
 friends that above all 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.380
 political therefore can attack to be 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.230
 plant species and the difficulty they can 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.870
 attack the plants and the gardens 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.380
 private and in all specialist 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.710
 so we ask for collaboration 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.280
 citizen to report so 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.330
 that we can intervene promptly 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
 take away on this aspect we have 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.980
 expected prompt intervention 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.890
 phytosanitary ie we take charge 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.970
 also of the killing just for 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.100
 shorten the time of this operation 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.840
 at the moment the felling of the trees is 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.990
 the only remedy to destroy i 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.030
 outbreaks from May to August then it is 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.100
 important to set traps on 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.400
 sensitive plants to capture the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.070
 adults the trap can be built 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.590
 easily cut in half at home 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.870
 plastic bottle by flipping the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.090
 upper part to form a 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.450
 funnel to avoid the ascent 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.300
 of the insect join the two parts e 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.990
 poured into the apple or 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.990
 of beer 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.570
 currently the Campania region 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.790
 actively engaged to put in 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.160
 field a precise strategy with 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.720
 the intent not to transform a danger 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.720
 in a real emergency 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.110
 we first worked to create 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.150
 a research reference system 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.330
 we took all the institutions 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.750
 related to cra at the university of 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.840
 naples at the university of salerno 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.530
 at the university of caserta but also e 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:35.910
 especially institutes of the cnr and we have 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:40.110
 created a network between these bodies and these 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:43.200
 institutes that obviously become the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.540
 our reference when you are 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.770
 faces a new pest and must 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.660
 be able to recognize them 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.440
 immediately these new emergencies 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.970
 because the timeliness in the field 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.979
 phytosanitary and the first requirement is 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:04.680
 what prevents you from the new one 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:05.910
 organism can be installed collection 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.820
 of most information 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.669
 possible by technicians is 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.650
 essential for deciding care for 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.650
 this is mandatory to communicate 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.820
 immediately to the phytosanitary service 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.070
 regional 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.070
 the presence of romea bugie 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.809
 there is also a toll-free number available 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:28.939
 of farmers to report the 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:35.509
 suspected cases or request information 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:37.659
 on the subject and the 888 10 17 of the region 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.659
 campania
