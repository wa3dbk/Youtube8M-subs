I<00:00:04.549> have<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.730> say<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:05.970> really<00:00:06.270> like<00:00:06.359> using<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.379> new

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
I have to say I really like using my new

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.580 
I have to say I really like using my new
pressure<00:00:08.250> bleeder<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:09.630> just<00:00:09.990> recently<00:00:10.290> added

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
pressure bleeder we just recently added

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.610 
pressure bleeder we just recently added
one<00:00:11.190> new<00:00:11.219> feature<00:00:11.639> that's<00:00:11.969> right<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
one new feature that's right here this

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.189 
one new feature that's right here this
little<00:00:13.980> yellow<00:00:14.849> release<00:00:15.480> valve<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
little yellow release valve this is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.740 
little yellow release valve this is
really<00:00:16.590> handy<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.070> mean<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.699> release<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
really handy I mean you can release the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.080 
really handy I mean you can release the
pressure<00:00:18.960> inside<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.680> tank<00:00:19.830> without<00:00:20.580> having

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pressure inside the tank without having

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.759 
pressure inside the tank without having
to<00:00:21.180> loosen<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> handle<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.289> take<00:00:22.560> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to loosen up the handle just take and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.939 
to loosen up the handle just take and
turn<00:00:23.090> this<00:00:24.090> yellow<00:00:24.750> little<00:00:25.650> knob

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
turn this yellow little knob

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.310 
turn this yellow little knob
counterclockwise<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> pressure

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
counterclockwise and all the pressure

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.250 
counterclockwise and all the pressure
bleeds<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.760> disadvantage

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
bleeds out if there's one disadvantage

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.639 
bleeds out if there's one disadvantage
to<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.470> pressure<00:00:31.980> bleeder<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.620> how<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to this pressure bleeder is in how you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.850 
to this pressure bleeder is in how you
have<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.430> attach<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.809> cap<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> brake

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
have to attach the cap to the brake

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700 
have to attach the cap to the brake
fluid<00:00:37.890> reservoir<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.050> twist<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
fluid reservoir what I do is I twist the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
fluid reservoir what I do is I twist the
hose<00:00:40.860> backwards<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.719> turn<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
hose backwards so that when you turn it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
hose backwards so that when you turn it
on<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.890> tighten<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.760> down<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.210> top<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
on and tighten it down on top the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
on and tighten it down on top the
reservoir<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.710> hose<00:00:46.980> all

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
reservoir you don't get this hose all

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
reservoir you don't get this hose all
kinked<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.329> recently<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> thinking

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
kinked up so recently I got to thinking

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
kinked up so recently I got to thinking
it'd<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.700> nice<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.510> were<00:00:51.690> an

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it'd be really nice if there were an

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.360 
it'd be really nice if there were an
easier<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.079> attach<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.100> cap

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
easier way to you know attach the cap

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.630 
easier way to you know attach the cap
and<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:56.910> attach<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.050> tank<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.520> if

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and then attach the tank and you know if

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
and then attach the tank and you know if
we<00:00:59.820> played<00:01:00.449> around<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.809> us<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
we played around with us here in the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
we played around with us here in the
shop<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.399> mechanic<00:01:02.910> came<00:01:03.000> oh<00:01:03.120> hey<00:01:03.239> well

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
shop and my mechanic came oh hey well

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.590 
shop and my mechanic came oh hey well
why<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.870> add<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.760> quick<00:01:05.760> disconnect<00:01:06.240> like

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
why don't we add a quick disconnect like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.120 
why don't we add a quick disconnect like
you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.350> air<00:01:07.500> hose<00:01:07.880> well<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
you have on an air hose well that just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
you have on an air hose well that just
started<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.280> kinds<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.970> creative<00:01:12.689> thinking

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
started all kinds of creative thinking

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.380 
started all kinds of creative thinking
we<00:01:13.170> decided<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.000> quick

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we decided well if we can have a quick

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
we decided well if we can have a quick
disconnect<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.460> tank<00:01:18.170> then<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> add

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
disconnect on this tank then we can add

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
disconnect on this tank then we can add
other<00:01:20.070> things<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> course<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
other things to it so over the course of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
other things to it so over the course of
the<00:01:22.619> past<00:01:22.830> three<00:01:23.070> weeks<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.119> we've

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the past three weeks look what we've

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.399 
the past three weeks look what we've
come<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.689> here's<00:01:25.530> here's<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> tank

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
come up with here's here's the tank

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.789 
come up with here's here's the tank
modified<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.350> quick<00:01:31.350> disconnect

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
modified now with a a quick disconnect

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.520 
modified now with a a quick disconnect
cap<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.840> tighten

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
cap so now you can just take and tighten

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
cap so now you can just take and tighten
the<00:01:34.590> cap<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> brake<00:01:35.670> fluid

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the cap down on the brake fluid

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.219 
the cap down on the brake fluid
reservoir<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:37.229> disconnect<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
reservoir and then disconnect the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
reservoir and then disconnect the
fitting<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> pump<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.070> pressure<00:01:41.400> warning<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
fitting and pump up pressure warning I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.620 
fitting and pump up pressure warning I
do<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> warn<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.740> sure<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.630> release

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
do have to warn you be sure and release

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800 
do have to warn you be sure and release
the<00:01:45.960> pressure<00:01:46.460> before<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.820> disconnect<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the pressure before you disconnect this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
the pressure before you disconnect this
or<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.590> brake<00:01:49.920> fluid<00:01:50.340> spraying

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
or you could have brake fluid spraying

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
or you could have brake fluid spraying
around<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.390> engine<00:01:51.659> compartment<00:01:51.720> that's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
around in your engine compartment that's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.200 
around in your engine compartment that's
a<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.799> an<00:01:53.009> important<00:01:53.460> warning<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.939> want<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
a that's an important warning I want to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780 
a that's an important warning I want to
emphasize<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> release

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
emphasize this because when you release

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
emphasize this because when you release
this<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.299> releases<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.960> air<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.290> quickly<00:01:58.590> in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
this it releases the air very quickly in

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.609 
this it releases the air very quickly in
fact<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> recommend<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.840> even<00:02:01.500> if

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
fact what I recommend you do even if

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.560 
fact what I recommend you do even if
you've<00:02:01.770> released<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.729> pressure<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you've released the pressure here in the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.050 
you've released the pressure here in the
tank<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.740> wrap<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> shop<00:02:05.430> rag<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.969> an

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

old<00:02:06.210> paper<00:02:06.420> towel<00:02:06.750> around<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.409> when<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
old paper towel around that so when you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.369 
old paper towel around that so when you
do<00:02:07.920> release<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.520> any<00:02:08.970> brake<00:02:09.539> fluid<00:02:09.929> drips<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
do release it any brake fluid drips that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.229 
do release it any brake fluid drips that
come<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.800> hose<00:02:10.979> you'll<00:02:11.700> catch<00:02:11.970> them

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
come out of the hose you'll catch them

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.850 
come out of the hose you'll catch them
in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> red

in the red
then<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.910> got<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.600> thinking<00:02:14.750> well<00:02:15.320> if<00:02:15.530> we<00:02:16.040> had

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
then we got to thinking well if we had

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.520 
then we got to thinking well if we had
some<00:02:16.550> other<00:02:16.730> fittings<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.960> could<00:02:18.230> actually

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
some other fittings we could actually

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.000 
some other fittings we could actually
take<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:20.050> adapt<00:02:21.050> other<00:02:21.350> things<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.860> this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
take and adapt other things to this

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.910 
take and adapt other things to this
pressure<00:02:22.340> tank<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.060> sprayer<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:24.860> we

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
pressure tank like the sprayer so now we

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.210 
pressure tank like the sprayer so now we
have<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> sprayer<00:02:25.990> with<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.170> correct<00:02:27.560> coupling

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
have a sprayer with the correct coupling

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.700 
have a sprayer with the correct coupling
on<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.850> hook<00:02:29.120> up<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> tank<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.440> will

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
on it to hook up to the tank this will

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.160 
on it to hook up to the tank this will
allow<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.340> put<00:02:31.910> cleaning<00:02:32.510> solvent<00:02:33.050> or

allow you to put cleaning solvent or
other<00:02:33.530> cleaning<00:02:33.890> solutions<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> tank<00:02:35.120> and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
other cleaning solutions in the tank and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.510 
other cleaning solutions in the tank and
you<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.110> spray<00:02:36.410> clean<00:02:36.710> your<00:02:36.860> engine<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.340> mean

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
you can spray clean your engine I mean

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.550 
you can spray clean your engine I mean
what<00:02:38.000> could<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.210> better<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:39.110> we<00:02:39.380> found

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
what could be better in this we found

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
if there's any leaks in you know your

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.130 
if there's any leaks in you know your
water<00:03:31.549> pump<00:03:31.820> hoses<00:03:32.150> or<00:03:32.510> even<00:03:32.780> your<00:03:32.900> head

water pump hoses or even your head
gasket<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.769> then<00:03:34.400> finally<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.000> got<00:03:35.120> playing

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
gasket and then finally we got playing

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.630 
gasket and then finally we got playing
around<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.989> idea<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.380> well<00:03:37.160> what<00:03:37.430> if<00:03:37.519> we

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
around with the idea of well what if we

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.500 
around with the idea of well what if we
pressurize<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.120> vacuum<00:03:38.600> system<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.480> we

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
pressurize a vacuum system and so we

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.690 
pressurize a vacuum system and so we
include<00:03:42.080> in<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.470> kit<00:03:42.680> some<00:03:42.980> extra<00:03:43.310> fittings

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
include in the kit some extra fittings

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.250 
include in the kit some extra fittings
that<00:03:43.940> will<00:03:44.900> allow<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.769> hook<00:03:46.430> up<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:47.260> small

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
that will allow you to hook up a small

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.820 
that will allow you to hook up a small
nipple<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:50.060> section<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.660> small<00:03:51.560> vacuum

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
nipple and a section of small vacuum

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.259 
nipple and a section of small vacuum
hose<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.720> can<00:03:53.930> pump<00:03:54.230> up<00:03:54.440> pressure<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.269> if

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
hose and you can pump up pressure and if

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.720 
hose and you can pump up pressure and if
you're<00:03:56.959> careful<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.590> can<00:03:57.860> actually<00:03:58.100> hear<00:03:58.580> you

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
you're careful you can actually hear you

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.280 
you're careful you can actually hear you
don't<00:03:58.880> want<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.090> lot<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.269> pressure<00:03:59.510> 10<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.930> 15

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
don't want a lot of pressure 10 to 15

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.250 
don't want a lot of pressure 10 to 15
psi<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.920> enough<00:04:01.310> but<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.330> go<00:04:02.540> around<00:04:02.660> to

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
psi is enough but if you go around to

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.500 
psi is enough but if you go around to
the<00:04:03.380> various<00:04:03.769> vacuum<00:04:04.700> components<00:04:05.299> in<00:04:05.390> your

actually hear the hissing even through
the<00:04:10.640> door<00:04:10.820> panel<00:04:11.150> now<00:04:11.540> we're<00:04:12.260> currently

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
the door panel now we're currently

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.259 
the door panel now we're currently
trying<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.250> figure<00:04:13.489> out<00:04:13.610> some<00:04:13.820> way<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.000> add<00:04:14.239> a

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
trying to figure out some way to add a

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.479 
trying to figure out some way to add a
little<00:04:14.570> smoke<00:04:14.959> machine<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.739> little<00:04:16.130> tank

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
little smoke machine to this little tank

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.610 
little smoke machine to this little tank
and<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.510> would<00:04:17.900> allow<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.140> to<00:04:18.350> actually

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
and that would allow you to actually

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.530 
and that would allow you to actually
pump<00:04:18.859> smoke<00:04:19.250> down<00:04:19.519> in<00:04:19.700> your<00:04:19.820> vacuum<00:04:20.000> system

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
pump smoke down in your vacuum system

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.290 
pump smoke down in your vacuum system
and<00:04:20.810> then<00:04:20.930> any<00:04:21.380> leak<00:04:21.770> would<00:04:22.370> show<00:04:22.610> up<00:04:22.729> by<00:04:22.910> smoke

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
and then any leak would show up by smoke

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.630 
and then any leak would show up by smoke
rolling<00:04:24.050> out<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.349> your<00:04:24.620> door<00:04:24.860> panel<00:04:25.099> or<00:04:25.430> out
