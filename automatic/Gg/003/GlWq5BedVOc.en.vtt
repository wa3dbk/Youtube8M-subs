00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
of itself doesn't really mean anything I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.230 
of itself doesn't really mean anything I
know<00:01:45.440> but<00:01:46.190> did<00:01:46.280> write<00:01:46.460> something<00:01:46.759> down<00:01:46.790> before

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
know but did write something down before

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.210 
know but did write something down before
we<00:01:47.270> started<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.690> if<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.200> could<00:01:48.350> show<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.830> see

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
we started so if you could show I see

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.370 
we started so if you could show I see
you<00:01:49.729> will<00:01:49.850> wake<00:01:50.030> up<00:01:50.060> at<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.960> four<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> diamonds

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
you will wake up at the four of diamonds

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.800

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
so if we look a little bit closer at the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.710 
so if we look a little bit closer at the
four<00:01:53.960> diamonds<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.890> see<00:01:55.039> that<00:01:55.160> I've<00:01:55.220> actually
