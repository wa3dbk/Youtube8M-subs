inspiration that came from from that
well<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> patched<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:44.539> to<00:00:45.539> meaning<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
well I patched to to meaning there was a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.049 
well I patched to to meaning there was a
one<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> happened<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> bring<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
one and so I happened to bring that

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.080 
one and so I happened to bring that
eyepatch<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:52.430> we<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> go

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
eyepatch one of we actually have to go

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
eyepatch one of we actually have to go
one<00:00:54.300> step<00:00:54.510> back<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.020> twitch<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
one step back to twitch which was the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
one step back to twitch which was the
first<00:00:56.789> small<00:00:57.149> sort<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> angular<00:00:58.649> glass<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
first small sort of angular glass that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.610 
first small sort of angular glass that
we<00:00:59.219> tried<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.140> had<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> lot<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> neat

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
we tried to do and had a lot of neat

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
we tried to do and had a lot of neat
little<00:01:01.770> details<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
little details on it I don't know if you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.859 
little details on it I don't know if you
can<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:04.369> fun<00:01:05.369> glass<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.939> pretty

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
can see that fun glass to do pretty

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.410 
can see that fun glass to do pretty
quick<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.470> too<00:01:07.650> many<00:01:07.740> sketches<00:01:08.070> involved<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
quick not too many sketches involved and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.450 
quick not too many sketches involved and
then<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> went<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:10.950> thought<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.340> know

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
then it went out and we thought you know

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
then it went out and we thought you know
let's<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.240> another<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.960> little

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
let's do another one that's a little

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.100 
let's do another one that's a little
bigger<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.250> wrap<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.990> we

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
bigger and have a wrap to it and so we

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
bigger and have a wrap to it and so we
basically<00:01:16.259> took<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.520> similar<00:01:17.759> CAD<00:01:18.180> data

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
basically took really similar CAD data

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.760 
basically took really similar CAD data
and<00:01:20.090> stretch<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> squeezed<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and stretch it and squeezed it into this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.140 
and stretch it and squeezed it into this
shape<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:24.240> came<00:01:24.540> high<00:01:24.780> patch<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
shape and then came high patch to and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
shape and then came high patch to and
from<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.780> said<00:01:27.990> well<00:01:28.200> where<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.560> want

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
from that we said well where do we want

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.870 
from that we said well where do we want
to<00:01:28.890> start<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> keep

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to start because we got to keep

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
to start because we got to keep
something<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.720> kept<00:01:30.960> virtually<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> same

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
something so we kept virtually the same

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
something so we kept virtually the same
length<00:01:32.340> shape<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.290> then<00:01:34.290> wanted<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
length shape and then wanted to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.550 
length shape and then wanted to
modernize<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.369> whole<00:01:35.549> frame<00:01:35.820> beyond<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
modernize the whole frame beyond that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.679 
modernize the whole frame beyond that
and<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.860> took<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.430> freaking<00:01:38.790> ever<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.450> draw

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and this took for freaking ever to draw

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.600 
and this took for freaking ever to draw
because<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.409> went<00:01:40.650> through<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.070> many<00:01:41.280> stages

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
because we went through so many stages

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.639 
because we went through so many stages
and<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.270> many<00:01:42.479> sketches<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and so many sketches and was it going to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.139 
and so many sketches and was it going to
have<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> influence<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> influence

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
have this influence or that influence

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.690 
have this influence or that influence
