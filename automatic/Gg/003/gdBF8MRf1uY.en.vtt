00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.350
 I always start with my usual base 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.640
 worldwide our base is very dry 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.500
 we must apply lunettes if there is 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.689
 is interested in a tutorial on how to create 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.070
 lunettes at home when the very simple 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.960
 paper scotch 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.669
 watch the video response to this 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.040
 however found also the link below 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.250
 for an event the color we will apply 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.780
 after we put a white base but 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.780
 obviously then we let it dry well 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.890
 now that dry fringed sponge is of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.309
 glitters gather rosa indeed both for 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.309
 the accuracy 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.610
 with the same sponge in it 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.610
 towards one off also in the middle and little finger 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.810
 with a sponge a clean instead 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.940
 we have to put colors in reverse 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:17.600
 such that pink rose is basin 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.760
 violet with violet leaves to dry a little 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.710
 then you can remove ours 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.780
 some residue of enamel in the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.760
 ter ali clean it with a little bit a 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.710
 ten women to choose from if 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.440
 leave them like this and then seal a 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.390
 amateurs a top coat or to make gods 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.390
 small decorations in black micro-paint 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.100
 when the micro painting is well dry 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.270
 step a layer of transparent nail polish 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.010
 let it dry and then two layers of 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.140
 finish the other pasta again 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.270
 I let it dry now with a little 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 patience I do from the tanaro in austria 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.430
 the art you like are all hello 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.790
 first we have to prepare many 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.440
 strips of likelihood of Caciotta been 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.450
 also of the transparent enamel with a 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.870
 what giuliani certainly must cover 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 contours of lies is not a job 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.280
 difficult but obviously my usual 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.280
 waste of time 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.340
 so on all the claws 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.890
 wait 2 seconds to remove 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.890
 all the scotch 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.950
 once dry this monster and docg 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.950
