00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
in a second the workbench to build this

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.520 
in a second the workbench to build this
is<00:01:22.329> going<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.540> be<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.780> below<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.170> power<00:01:23.350> room

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
is going to be just below the power room

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.260 
is going to be just below the power room
and<00:01:23.650> as<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.829> can<00:01:23.979> see<00:01:24.009> there's<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.759> debris

it's on the barrel next to the debris

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.700 
it's on the barrel next to the debris
sometimes<00:01:27.820> here's<00:01:28.659> another<00:01:28.930> piece<00:01:29.200> now<00:01:29.530> this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
sometimes here's another piece now this

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.170 
sometimes here's another piece now this
one<00:01:29.860> doesn't<00:01:30.159> actually<00:01:30.280> move<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:30.820> one<00:01:30.970> will

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
one doesn't actually move this one will

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.960 
one doesn't actually move this one will
always<00:01:31.360> spawn<00:01:31.869> right<00:01:32.259> here<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:32.979> it's<00:01:33.880> a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
always spawn right here and so it's a

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.179 
always spawn right here and so it's a
foot<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.509> use<00:01:34.600> as<00:01:34.810> like<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.140> stock<00:01:35.710> for<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:35.979> gun

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
foot to use as like a stock for the gun

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.280 
foot to use as like a stock for the gun
but<00:01:37.000> alright<00:01:37.450> now<00:01:37.570> we're<00:01:37.750> going<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.899> get<00:01:38.079> to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
but alright now we're going to get to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.139

for this next part is going to be by the
elevators<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.239> power<00:02:17.450> room<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.349> just

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
elevators in the power room that's just

elevators in the power room that's just
one<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.860> locations<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:19.640> you'll<00:02:19.790> see

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
one of the locations of this you'll see

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.580 
one of the locations of this you'll see
it<00:02:20.090> kind<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.330> looks<00:02:20.540> like<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.750> trigger<00:02:21.170> with<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
handle and so it can spawn on top of one

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.030 
handle and so it can spawn on top of one
of<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> tables<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.540> power<00:02:27.290> room<00:02:27.590> towards

a corner and just spray down on the
ground<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:52.760> they<00:03:52.910> all<00:03:53.180> fall<00:03:53.660> when<00:03:53.840> you're

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
ground so they all fall when you're

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.060 
ground so they all fall when you're
trying<00:03:54.050> to<00:03:54.170> run<00:03:54.290> away<00:03:54.320> or<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.770> can<00:03:54.890> have<00:03:55.040> a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
trying to run away or you can have a

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.640 
trying to run away or you can have a
little<00:03:55.220> fun<00:03:55.430> with<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:57.080> can<00:03:57.200> make<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.440> into

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
little fun with it you can make it into

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:11.140 
little fun with it you can make it into
a<00:03:57.680> nice<00:03:57.860> little<00:03:58.070> slip<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.520> slide<00:04:10.150> nothing

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
a nice little slip and slide nothing

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.180 
a nice little slip and slide nothing
like<00:04:11.270> slip<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.600> slide<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:11.930> zombies<00:04:12.350> all<00:04:12.920> right

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
like slip and slide in zombies all right

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.090 
like slip and slide in zombies all right
so<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:14.360> second<00:04:14.810> part<00:04:14.989> of<00:04:15.170> how<00:04:15.320> this<00:04:15.560> gun<00:04:15.800> works

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
so the second part of how this gun works

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.490 
so the second part of how this gun works
if<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.609> shoot<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.940> zombie<00:04:17.090> directly<00:04:17.750> what

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
if you shoot a zombie directly what

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.080 
if you shoot a zombie directly what
it'll<00:04:18.680> do<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:18.950> it'll<00:04:19.100> automatically<00:04:19.790> make

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
it'll do is it'll automatically make

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.000 
it'll do is it'll automatically make
that<00:04:20.269> particular<00:04:20.810> zombie<00:04:21.140> explode<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.859> it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
that particular zombie explode and it

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.310 
that particular zombie explode and it
has<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> chain<00:04:22.490> reaction<00:04:22.669> effect<00:04:23.330> if<00:04:23.510> there<00:04:24.169> is

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
has a chain reaction effect if there is

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.500 
has a chain reaction effect if there is
any<00:04:24.560> zombie<00:04:25.040> within<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.550> splash<00:04:25.850> radius<00:04:26.090> of

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
any zombie within the splash radius of

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.860 
any zombie within the splash radius of
that<00:04:26.780> explosion<00:04:27.169> they<00:04:28.160> automatically<00:04:28.910> will

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
that explosion they automatically will

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.170 
that explosion they automatically will
explode<00:04:30.350> as<00:04:30.500> well<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.950> continue<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.880> splash

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
explode as well and continue the splash

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.930 
explode as well and continue the splash
radius<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.919> so<00:04:33.919> as<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.160> can<00:04:34.280> see<00:04:34.490> those<00:04:34.700> two

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
radius and so as you can see those two

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.760 
radius and so as you can see those two
zombies<00:04:35.150> had<00:04:35.479> actually<00:04:35.870> gotten<00:04:36.200> splashed<00:04:36.620> by

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
zombies had actually gotten splashed by

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.710 
zombies had actually gotten splashed by
that<00:04:36.919> second<00:04:37.310> one<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.700> if<00:04:37.910> your<00:04:38.390> zombies

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
that second one and so if your zombies

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.120 
that second one and so if your zombies
are<00:04:38.840> close<00:04:39.020> enough<00:04:39.050> together<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.830> will<00:04:39.979> get

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
are close enough together you will get

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.640 
are close enough together you will get
that<00:04:40.370> kind<00:04:40.640> of<00:04:40.760> effect<00:04:41.410> here's<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.470> good

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
that kind of effect here's a good

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.900 
that kind of effect here's a good
strategy<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.340> order<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.610> get<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.820> achievement

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
strategy in order to get the achievement

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.460 
strategy in order to get the achievement
because<00:04:44.270> again<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.660> achievement<00:04:45.080> calls<00:04:45.260> for

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
because again the achievement calls for

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.550 
because again the achievement calls for
killing<00:04:45.770> five<00:04:46.040> zombies<00:04:46.630> with<00:04:47.630> one<00:04:47.960> shot<00:04:48.260> from

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
killing five zombies with one shot from

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.400 
killing five zombies with one shot from
the<00:04:48.710> gun<00:04:49.510> as<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.630> can<00:04:50.750> see<00:04:50.870> what<00:04:50.990> i'm<00:04:51.050> doing

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
the gun as you can see what i'm doing

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.110 
the gun as you can see what i'm doing
here<00:04:51.500> is<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.740> have<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.220> little<00:04:52.520> bit<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.729> the

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
here is I have a little bit of the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.790 
here is I have a little bit of the
liquid<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.930> floor<00:04:54.229> in<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.470> middle<00:04:54.560> and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
liquid on the floor in the middle and

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.060 
liquid on the floor in the middle and
I'm<00:04:54.919> kind<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.220> just<00:04:56.710> spinning<00:04:57.710> them<00:04:57.830> around

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
I'm kind of just spinning them around

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.630 
I'm kind of just spinning them around
here<00:04:59.530> now<00:05:00.530> if<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.830> were<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.100> take<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.400> shot

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
here now if I were to take the shot

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.969 
here now if I were to take the shot
there<00:05:01.970> it<00:05:02.240> would<00:05:02.810> actually<00:05:03.290> kill<00:05:03.500> all<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.770> them

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
there it would actually kill all of them

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.080 
there it would actually kill all of them
because<00:05:04.190> they<00:05:04.370> are<00:05:04.520> close<00:05:04.790> enough<00:05:04.820> together

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
because they are close enough together

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.850 
because they are close enough together
to<00:05:05.330> where<00:05:05.630> they<00:05:05.900> would<00:05:06.080> splash<00:05:06.350> on<00:05:06.530> each<00:05:06.650> other

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
to where they would splash on each other

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.650 
to where they would splash on each other
I<00:05:07.070> didn't<00:05:07.790> do<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:07.910> in<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.150> particular<00:05:08.360> area

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
I didn't do it in that particular area

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.140 
I didn't do it in that particular area
this<00:05:09.080> video<00:05:10.010> is<00:05:10.130> made<00:05:10.280> from<00:05:10.460> different<00:05:10.880> clips

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
this video is made from different clips

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.840 
this video is made from different clips
and<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:12.680> here<00:05:12.890> I'm<00:05:12.979> kind<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.280> gathering<00:05:13.580> some

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
and so here I'm kind of gathering some

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.550 
and so here I'm kind of gathering some
zombies<00:05:14.210> around<00:05:14.360> I'm<00:05:14.690> gonna<00:05:14.780> kind<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.410> make

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
zombies around I'm gonna kind of make

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.750 
zombies around I'm gonna kind of make
them<00:05:15.680> slip<00:05:15.950> coming<00:05:16.220> out<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:16.520> doorway

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
them slip coming out of this doorway

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.510 
them slip coming out of this doorway
that<00:05:17.090> way<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.510> can

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
that way I can

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.159 
that way I can
stall<00:05:20.180> them<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.569> get<00:05:20.660> them<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> little<00:05:21.020> bit

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
stall them and get them a little bit

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.260 
stall them and get them a little bit
more<00:05:21.289> together<00:05:21.620> so<00:05:22.460> as<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.639> can<00:05:22.729> see<00:05:22.940> there<00:05:23.120> we

more together so as you can see there we

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.999 
more together so as you can see there we
have<00:05:23.479> at<00:05:23.690> least<00:05:23.810> five<00:05:24.110> zombies<00:05:24.349> there's<00:05:24.800> more

undead for 15 gamerscore again guys it's
not<00:05:36.949> too<00:05:37.159> hard<00:05:37.400> of<00:05:37.520> an<00:05:37.610> achievement<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.180> get<00:05:38.389> it

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
not too hard of an achievement to get it

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.779 
not too hard of an achievement to get it
doesn't<00:05:38.870> take<00:05:38.990> very<00:05:39.020> long<00:05:39.259> to<00:05:39.470> do<00:05:39.800> if<00:05:40.069> you<00:05:40.310> just

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
doesn't take very long to do if you just

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.730 
doesn't take very long to do if you just
play<00:05:41.030> around<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.659> go<00:05:41.960> for<00:05:42.319> the<00:05:42.409> achievement
