Scott<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.230> say<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.530> way<00:00:13.679> after

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
Scott I like to say it that way after

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.440 
Scott I like to say it that way after
downloading<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.759> running<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.150> found<00:00:15.360> that

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
downloading and running it I found that

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540 
downloading and running it I found that

the biggest file uses four gigabytes was

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.580 
the biggest file uses four gigabytes was

won't use the slower hard drive as a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
won't use the slower hard drive as a
substitute<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:58.140> yeah<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> course<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
substitute right yeah of course like

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.349 
substitute right yeah of course like
eight<00:00:59.309> twelve<00:00:59.609> gigabytes<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.239> going

eight twelve gigabytes it's only going

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.330 
eight twelve gigabytes it's only going
to<00:01:00.420> work<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.840> 64-bit<00:01:01.500> operating<00:01:01.710> system

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to work with a 64-bit operating system

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
to work with a 64-bit operating system
like<00:01:02.489> Windows<00:01:02.640> 7<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.660> argument<00:01:03.899> goes

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
like Windows 7 and this argument goes

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
like Windows 7 and this argument goes
way<00:01:04.680> people<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.400> been<00:01:05.549> trying<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> figure

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
way people have been trying to figure

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
way people have been trying to figure
out<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> eliminate<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.990> page<00:01:07.200> file

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
out how to eliminate the the page file

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
out how to eliminate the the page file
forever<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.280> wouldn't<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.630> RAM

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
forever I wouldn't put it all in RAM
