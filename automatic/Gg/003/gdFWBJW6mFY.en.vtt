00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Only a few armored vehicles can surprise you on a battlefield like a 180-ton heavy steel giant known as the German heavy Maus tank. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Working on it began after the completion of the project "Lowe" and its development took place from March 1942 to June 1944. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Krupp armament factory planned to produce 141 tanks, but the British Air Force bombers regularly disrupted this plan. In 1943, the Krupp factory suffered heavy 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 damage during operation "Ruhr Pocket". 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 As a result, Maus tank production was barred for nearly eight months. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Before the production facility was restored, the order from Krupp was reduced. Krupp was supposed to build only two tanks and one tower, instead of the originally planned 141 vehicles. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 If the British Air Force did not undertake repeated raids on German arms factories that were able to stop their production, the Maus tanks might have gone into service 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 in greater numbers and appeared on the battlefields of World War II. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 However, it did not happen. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 In World of Tanks, the Maus tank is the highest-level vehicle among German heavy tanks. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 So we will evaluate the combat characteristics of this vehicle compared to other level 10 heavy tanks. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 To evaluate these properties, we will use a ranking from 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Driving and movement characteristics are worse than other tanks of the same class. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 The torso rotation speed is 15 degrees per second, the tower rotation speed is 14 degrees per second. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 The maximum speed is 20 km / h. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 The most powerful aspects of this tank does not include shooting skills. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Focus time is 2.9 seconds. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 The accuracy of the gun is 0.38 m at a distance of 100 meters. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Damage per shot is an average of 490. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 The average punch penetration is 246 millimeters. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 This tank is one of the best armored in the game. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 The upper armor has a thickness of 200 mm and is tilted at 52 degrees, which means it can withstand the hits of the most effective works in the game. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 The side armor has a thickness of 185 mm, but its slope is 0 degrees, which reduces its efficiency. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 The tower's front armor is 240 mm thick and has a convex shape. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 The tower's armor is 210 mm thick and tilted at 30 degrees. This armor can be a tough nut for most tanks. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 The tank has 3,000 points, the highest in the game. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Like other heavy tanks of its level, with the exception of the British, it has a surveillance of 400 meters. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 So let's summarize: 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 The disadvantages of the Maus tank include its low acceleration and only average weapon efficiency. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Moreover, its gigantic silhouette makes this tank a great target for artillery. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The main advantages of this vehicle include huge power and solid armor. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Weak points include the sides of the tower, the lower armor and poorly armored chassis parts that can be shot through at an angle to its belts. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Let's look at the tactics of combat now. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 The Maus tank is the right vehicle for the front line. It can withstand a lot of damage and can protect allies from enemy fire. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Traditionally, city maps are considered the ideal place to fight heavy tanks. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 You can hold positions or attack the wings. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And the risk of getting hit by artillery is really small. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 You should not forget the weak points: Cover the lower armor and turn the tower so that the enemies do not have a chance to aim at its hips. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 It is really important to understand what you have in which stage of the battle to do. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 You should not drive forward in the first few minutes just because you don't see anyone in front of you. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 The enemy can wait for you around the corner. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 If you are confident that there are only a few tanks in front of you, put your team colleagues together and then proceed. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Support from your teammates is really important - if the Maus tank is left alone, it will be an easy target for enemies because it cannot fight on two fronts. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 As an example we can use the map "Ruinberg". 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 We will only talk about the city districts of this map because we strongly advise you to avoid open spaces. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 At the start of the battle, you should move to G3 and use the destroyed building as a cover. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 From here you can shoot through the openings in the building. 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 If enemies move through the third line or use defensive tactics, you will be able to damage them while remaining protected. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 From this square you can do the following: 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 If there are many enemy tanks, move to section F2 and shoot at them from behind the bend. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Suppress the third line or even move to section J2 if enemies penetrate a small town. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 In general, whatever you play on any map, you should take a few steps to give your team some advantages over your enemies. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Maus cannot move quickly from one wing to another. Therefore, you should anticipate on which wing you will encounter the main enemy forces and fulfill your role there. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 You will never use the full potential of this tank on open maps such as "Malinovka", "Prokhorovka", "El halluf", "Desert River" and "Step". 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Maus is slow, so it's really hard to change position or to quickly find cover. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Thanks to his giant dimensions, the enemy observers will notice him more quickly and the artillery will shoot as soon as possible. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 And its only average penetration along with low shooting accuracy makes it impossible to shoot at great distances. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 In the "Malinovka" map, the best decision is to stay close to a monastery or barn. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 You can hide behind the mountains in the "El Halluf" map. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 In the "Desert River" map, drive into the city and try to hide from enemy fire. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 In the "Step" map, you can use boulders to cover and shoot from there to other heavy tanks. 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 The "Prokhorovka" map is one of the worst for the Maus because the enemies can reveal and destroy you before you even get into position. 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Therefore, you should move carefully and use it as a cover for the remaining building in the village. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Any other behavior will mean your certain death. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 The efficiency of the Maus tank is highly dependent on the map you play. 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 This is an important problem with playing with this vehicle. 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 In valleys and other places where you can hide from artillery, it can be really useful, but as soon as the Maus tank appears on another map where it remains 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 alone, becomes very vulnerable. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 It would be a surprise if you managed to successfully complete the battle. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 We should also mention the other weakness of the Maus tank: When you place yours at an angle, the enemy can shoot at your belts. 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 The bullet penetrates them and hits an armor that is only 80 millimeters thick. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 You don't have to worry about that for long distances, but whenever you have an enemy, you should build your tank at close range to increase the chance of a shot. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 When colliding with almost any other tank, you can use your weight to your advantage. 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Impact damage is not high, but may be useful. 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 To increase the efficiency of your tank in combat, you should purchase the following equipment: 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 The hydraulic cannon gun, cannon stabilizer, and improved cannon propulsion for your tank will help in close combat, improving your aiming and allowing you to shoot faster. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 In terms of crew members' skills, the most effective combination is: 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 That's for now. Good luck on the battlefield!
