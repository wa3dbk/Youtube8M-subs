00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.650
 operation metro 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.840
 Do you know what I am with this map 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.700
 kept thinking why is that 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.990
 actually so successful and why 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.910
 she actually likes to play 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.560
 metro that time even well managed 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.060
 in battlefield 4 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.460
 originally it is indeed a card 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.379
 Battlefield 3 But as they are so famous and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.270
 also a piece was occupied 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.180
 then done within the framework of the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.850
 disease then in battlefield 4 1 too 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.250
 maintain and even then tidy well 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.989
 to distribute his metro charms and with 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.680
 maybe you can shield up to 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.989
 come along 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.839
 some on the one hand the hassliebe 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.699
 metro is simply a hate love map 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.070
 one side is actually one 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.059
 cool setting i mean we have the u 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 train station 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.610
 paris the metro super cool thing straight 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.589
 for him by player around times tidy 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.210
 clean up neat fun neat 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.580
 klos quarter battles to have 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.620
 On the other side is the webdesign 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.000
 when mails or rather a bit far 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.850
 questionable 10 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.049
 the hose system or the straight line 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.700
 which has to be gone 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.890
 especially now when we have the congress mode 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.530
 consider is not really optimal 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.600
 solved because the way leads in the end 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.460
 only in one direction and even if we 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.049
 possibilities have now also in 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.450
 the battlefield 4 version the one or 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.890
 other additional way or turn off 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.780
 then he is not really 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.520
 crucial to on the map 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.869
 tearing out properly and for 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.350
 those who always do not know what it is 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.030
 here goes 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.270
 this is about the cluster sale 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.649
 metro the b question quite clearly if 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.859
 you have two teams I say now times 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.380
 64 x commerce server comes to me 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.700
 would almost say 80 85 if not even 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.429
 90 percent 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.799
 they reap the benefits of this 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.149
 the b flag or already to the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.369
 escalators there 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.590
 the corresponding front fight 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.869
 that means the attacking one 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.109
 Team also at the C flag is below 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.399
 the team from the pad stands up and 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.630
 shoots down and the others 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.940
 of course, try to get up 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.069
 because, of course, the team that's the edition 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.720
 has thus also the b question possesses and 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.520
 of course, corresponding ticket bleed 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.080
 of course, that causes opponents 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.730
 He is forced from the bottom up 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.590
 to push but that is in most 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.750
 round 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.360
 simply simply impossible because metro 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 The principle applies to who flags 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.110
 cluster fact does not fight the has 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.640
 lost whoever dares forward war 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.510
 usually a neat on the cap 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.790
 be it that apk the aws or mp4 what 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 already ready grenades from the top 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.349
 grenade launcher or the one or 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.150
 other fragmentary grenades or simply 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.410
 Any other fire is up there 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.209
 Finally comes the sniper 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.709
 and take you away because they are somewhere 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.239
 all are still in the corner but 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.769
 still the one look up 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.430
 corresponding points have where the opponents 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.560
 come long 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.959
 that is the opinion of the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.209
 because it simply persists and the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.099
 round in the end piece far in already 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.780
 the first five minutes decides if 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.370
 Of course, the team of the edition is also 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 Creates the question as quickly as possible 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.420
 to take and hold and 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.340
 then of course not only consists of box 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 then the probability is very high 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.060
 low that the other pull that 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.530
 opposing team it creates this question 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.459
 to take one let alone the b 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.319
 question to accept 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.970
 sometimes that happens then shifted 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.900
 the cluster fact to the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.310
 ticket switches 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.500
 and we have the same situation there 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.329
 again in front of the other team only owns 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.280
 yet the pad can be so far 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.410
 defend there any people the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.030
 try to get out of the metro stations 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.250
 There are three points to run 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.139
 become from the people fighting there 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.730
 shot again and fought it 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.290
 This meant not negative at all 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.239
 in effect, it does not move as soon as possible 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.340
 man ventures out man is shot 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.720
 as soon as you do not say out happens 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.430
 but that does not happen to us either 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.530
 simply that position fight on 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.630
 The start is not on metro 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.340
 only the subway stops moving me 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.440
 My mode rush is still there 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.730
 reasonably okay also the setting for it 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.709
 the first point is still yes 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.840
 is located above the metro 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.389
 actually kÃ¶bes and is also cool 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130
 but at the latest in the interior just when 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.290
 the teams are strong enough 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.030
 same strength or have 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.280
 of course, the defending team a piece 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.780
 The river is much stronger 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.880
 to succumb to the course, too 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.010
 but guessing can also happen metro 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.500
 especially because of the tight card design 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.820
 just worse is on 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.829
 As we said, we have the congress 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.329
 a classic cluster fact you have to 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.610
 to adjust and there of course is the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.289
 ask why do people love it ? 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.150
 Actually, people are still playing 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.460
 comparatively like metro why is there 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.420
 still so many metro without server and 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.430
 why are they always like that? 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.320
 blatantly filled on one side could 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.600
 you might suspect the people 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.280
 on a normal gameplay or on 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.350
 a new server with other cards 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.360
 not so much traveling can be happy 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.340
 on metro to tap the 100 kills 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.990
 because then he can not do that 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.670
 really much skill in the corner too 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.390
 squat and wait for the opponent before 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.590
 the gun is running 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.420
 In addition, you can of course with 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.730
 explosive ammunition a corresponding 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.560
 points grenades or apps 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.240
 shoot as it occurs again and again 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.580
 and there just a three times 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.080
 or a four - string also take that out 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.790
 does not really require a lot of skill there 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.750
 because the people are always only at the 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.890
 corresponding points 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.870
 maybe it's the feeling as well 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.300
 on this map simply the sole 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.760
 heroes try to be heroes 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.380
 penetrate front line and then 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.130
 just for his team the victory 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.500
 rauszuholen 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.870
 maybe that feeling is what 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.580
 you can possibly reach on metro 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.960
 However, the probability is very 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.720
 that's a small thing to do 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.550
 because as I said as a single one man 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.930
 Army does not make it on metro either 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.650
 more so the people are really there 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.970
 wegzukriegen 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.620
 basically it can be said that 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.360
 Metro actually bad side is like 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.740
 also one or the other 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.030
 cards in battlefield 4 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.050
 and maybe you would think twice 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.150
 Maybe should be on the surface 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.320
 to get away from one another 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.300
 the whole possibly also with 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.580
 Pump up the car and then one 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.960
 to deliver the whole package and not easy 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.000
 only the cluster fact we have today 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.860
 what do you think you have 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.660
 Learn now and what you think about it 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.950
 I'm naturally interested in 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.260
 so write down in the below 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.150
 comments what you mean by operation metro 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.980
 think if you basically the map like 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.480
 play or rather keep your hands off it 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.800
 and what are you looking at? 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.240
 would want changes and if I did 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.260
 the video driven by the economy 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.330
 load in any case the thumbs up 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.670
 says and subscribes for course 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.260
 further consensus about battlefield and co 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.960
 in this sense, I can only say 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.170
 was the goal always in the eye, I am only 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.170
 get out 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.330
 if you still do not have beef you 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.490
 then have a look at chat partner dj 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.500
 The game is over and there are many 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.939
 others to sport cheap praise link 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.360
 of course in the video 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.360
