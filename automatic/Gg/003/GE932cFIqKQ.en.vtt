00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.390
 again fine today we're going to see a way 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.700
 more to preserve the parsley in the fridge 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.269
 that lasts a long time for it 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.370
 we need a glass jar a jar 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.270
 that is washed and well clear dry 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.970
 our that if it is wet does not serve us 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.460
 and then we take the dried parsley 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.410
 we also do not get it we wash it wolf 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.199
 when we are going to use it for 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.300
 We're recording them now 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.640
 you can record because then you do not know 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.570
 keep and we will cut him 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.570
 the twigs 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.040
 to not leave so much trunk clear because 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.990
 if it would not be too much we would need 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.990
 too much space and mental 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.329
 cutting from the leaves 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.320
 nothing happens either, yes there is some 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 trunk 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.110
 and tell him this you can also catch and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.110
 put the whole branch and save it so 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.110
 let's go like this let's have more space 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 sometimes we want to make a dish and not 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.640
 we have the parsley and so with this 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.479
 system, we always have pears and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.479
 cool 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.590
 you can also another way is also 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.860
 make this same system in a sachet 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.860
 of plastic 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.300
 I also know that everything that does not have 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.180
 no moisture or water or anything because 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.180
 then mendrisio is not preserved 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.780
 another way is also to do the same and 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.610
 put it in the freezer what happens that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.790
 then when it is time to use it, 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.510
 It's as pretty as that, so we're going to 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.510
 which have such 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.950
 let's leave this 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.830
 but it just approaches me in the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.860
 car 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.810
 [Music] 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.810
 or in a plastic bag 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.420
 to 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.450
 and we have it 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.580
 even more 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.580
 good good, well 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.209
 I hope you like it 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.640
 and it's a way to preserve the parsley 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.959
 it's very simple and when we always have 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.510
 at our disposal is what 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.090
 we keep and it does not cost us much divine 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.349
 because it keeps well thank you very much and 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.349
 see you next video
