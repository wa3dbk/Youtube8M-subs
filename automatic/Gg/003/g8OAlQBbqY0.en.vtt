only difference between this and the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.980 
only difference between this and the
icon<00:01:04.620> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> fact<00:01:05.130> that<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.990> running

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
icon is the fact that this is running

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
icon is the fact that this is running
the<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.430> gave<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> new<00:01:08.880> version<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.450> Windows

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the you gave a new version of Windows

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
the you gave a new version of Windows
Phone<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.500> windows<00:01:10.680> phone<00:01:11.070> 8.1<00:01:11.310> on

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
Phone so it's got windows phone 8.1 on

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.900 
Phone so it's got windows phone 8.1 on
here<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.200> has<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.980> features

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
here and so it has all the same features

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.240 
here and so it has all the same features
that<00:01:15.060> come<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.330> Windows<00:01:16.170> long<00:01:16.410> so<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that come with Windows long so if you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
that come with Windows long so if you
have<00:01:17.910> been<00:01:18.000> thinking<00:01:18.270> about<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.780> you've

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
have been thinking about this and you've

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.500 
have been thinking about this and you've
already<00:01:19.080> impaired<00:01:20.030> devices<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
already impaired devices this is what it

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.040 
already impaired devices this is what it
looks<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.750> next<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.410> a<00:01:22.500> 15-30<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.540> Lumia

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
looks like next to a 15-30 and a Lumia

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.160 
looks like next to a 15-30 and a Lumia
925<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.370> we've<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.990> devices<00:01:27.990> there

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
925 there you go we've got devices there

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.750 
925 there you go we've got devices there
so<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.830> an<00:01:28.860> idea<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.400> the
