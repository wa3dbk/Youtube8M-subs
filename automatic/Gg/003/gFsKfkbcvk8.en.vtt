00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.910
 the invitation 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:13.719
 of modernity is called space but not 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.350
 it is properly speaking something 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.250
 modern who puts the space who precisely 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.500
 invents space is a formidable 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.470
 character of antiquity 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.760
 the last of the Greek scholars the heir ie 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.840
 of the great speculative tradition 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.320
 jonica whose name was tolomeo tolomeo 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.739
 writes many bad books writes 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.519
 especially one for what we now have 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.649
 interested in writing a text that we 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.429
 still today we call geography in 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.640
 reality what a textbook is a textbook 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.819
 practical in which he teaches art or if 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.239
 you want the technique of subtracting one 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:06.270
 dimension to the world that is to say precisely 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:10.030
 to turn the sphere into a map 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.100
 tolomeo lives in the second century after christ 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 a couple of centuries later the whole culture 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.850
 Latin of which tolomeo expression 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.450
 absolutely collapses no longer exists in the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.969
 Middle Ages 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.280
 the only Italian region where it still is 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.939
 he knew tolomeo was sicily but 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.430
 only because there were the Arabs but the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:41.490
 Western world had lost every 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.259
 memory of tolomeo and his works 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.109
 a thousand years later 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:52.179
 at the beginning of 1400 tolomeo thorne in 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:58.030
 west of bisanzio, a scholar carries with 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:01.600
 if a copy of the text is in Florence 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.130
 naturally the Italian city that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.310
 at the beginning of the fifteenth century 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.149
 at the forefront of all that ed 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.850
 innovative moved in operation 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.850
 of the world and in its modeling 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.900
 less twenty years later in florence was born 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.939
 something absolutely extraordinary 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.980
 who decides the nature of existence 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.680
 of the entire modern era is born 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.319
 space and art historians ce 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.290
 they taught it and nothing else 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 space that the rediscovery of the technique 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.250
 Ptolemaic sphere transformation 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.519
 in a table and here we must remember 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.980
 immediately to try to understand also 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.680
 today what happens like today world 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.099
 it works that we know only two 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.239
 there are models from this point of view 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.900
 space 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.250
 he is the place they are antithetic they are 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.560
 nothing else irreducible can be 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.169
 confusing the space with each other 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.939
 is based on the rule 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.519
 of general equivalence 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.919
 just like the market there 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.120
 it would have been the market as well as us 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.870
 today we know it 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 if at the beginning of the 1400s tolomeo was not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.930
 been reimported to the west and 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.449
 general equivalence means that all 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.500
 the parts are the same are the same 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:39.099
 what functionally functionally it 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.470
 space means celeritas speed was 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.470
 something that even the ancient Romans 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.049
 they knew of course but the ancients 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.269
 Romans with space made us 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.030
 only war will serve only to 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.870
 make war with modernity the space 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.799
 that is, speed becomes the rule 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.739
 fundamental for all the reports of 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.699
 which life associated with social life is 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.769
 composes modernity is the era of 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:12.189
 space of general equivalence of 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.379
 its parts and general meaning means 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.229
 that if yes I change a part with 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.009
 the other is even not exposed 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.489
 nothing happens 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:25.240
 the world remains what the place is to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.510
 contrary is exactly that part which 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.000
 I consider 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.060
 reducible to any other reason 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.220
 because it has specific qualities 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.170
 that cannot be exchanged with those 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.480
 of no other the two models 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.670
 these are fundamental 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.870
 Aristotle believed a world made of 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:51.000
 places only places modernity 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.520
 instead it rejects the concept of place a 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.100
 favor of the spread of space e 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.110
 the fundamental choice on which all 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.930
 the others fit together and build 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.630
 space is born exactly like 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:12.570
 horizontal version of that art of 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.300
 the technical one the projection that tolomeo 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.700
 he taught in his manual 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.720
 that is to say to represent the earth 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.780
 as an immense plan regulated by the 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.600
 general equivalence tolomeo spoke of 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.810
 way of knowledge 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.050
 the moderns will say projection why 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.280
 because in the process of alchemy la 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.950
 projection the highlight that 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.960
 consists of the greatest transformation 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:48.150
 conceivable the projection dust 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.910
 sprinkled on the vile metal or on the stone there 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.880
 thus turning from gold to calling 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:58.530
 projections proceeding with which it is 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.230
 possible to represent the earth as 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.590
 space moderns celebrate the 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.170
 awareness of being in front of the 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.040
 greatest transformation possible 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.440
 never conceive that of a reality 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.710
 heterogeneous, that is, composed of parts 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:21.860
 the other qualitatively different in 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:25.080
 a single expanse that was possible 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.800
 assume as the realm of equivalence 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.760
 this is how modernity is born e 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.490
 when heidegger will say that modernity is 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.440
 the era of the image of the world is being 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.810
 referring exactly to this 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.530
 awareness 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.340
 all ages turns heidegger all 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.320
 cultures have elaborated and elaborated 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.070
 they elaborate images of the world but only 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:55.310
 one the western culture will demand 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.610
 that his image of the world is the 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.080
 world corresponds to the world yes that 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.810
 operating on the image means operating 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.810
 directly to the world immediately
