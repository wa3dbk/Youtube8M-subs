00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
three point one point to even though it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.810 
three point one point to even though it
will<00:01:40.740> tell<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.070> using<00:01:41.369> three<00:01:41.579> point<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
will tell them using three point one

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.280 
will tell them using three point one
point<00:01:41.939> three<00:01:42.180> even<00:01:42.509> though<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.020> using

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
point three even though you're not using
