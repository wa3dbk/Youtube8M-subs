00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the sponge applicator is that it does

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.750 
the sponge applicator is that it does
use<00:01:49.729> up<00:01:50.000> more<00:01:50.240> foundation<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.890> that's<00:01:52.400> one

this<00:02:29.580> brush<00:02:29.880> gives<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.360> really<00:02:30.600> nice

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this brush gives a really nice

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.680 
this brush gives a really nice
application<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.700> foundation<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.570> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
application of the foundation but the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990 
application of the foundation but the
only<00:02:33.810> problem<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.160> brush<00:02:35.490> does

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
only problem is that this brush does

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
only problem is that this brush does
shed<00:02:37.010> yes<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.370> does<00:02:38.430> shed<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.720> that's<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
shed yes it does shed so that's the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.120 
shed yes it does shed so that's the
downfall<00:02:41.240> other<00:02:42.240> than<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.380> blends

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
downfall other than that it just blends

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.550 
downfall other than that it just blends
your<00:02:44.520> foundation<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.330> nicely<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:46.230> kind<00:02:46.470> of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
your foundation and nicely just kind of

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.780 
your foundation and nicely just kind of
stipple<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.840> Pat<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.050> here<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.560> there

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
swirl it in and it leaves a real

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.370 
swirl it in and it leaves a real
airbrush<00:02:53.430> nice<00:02:53.760> feeling<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.360> your<00:02:54.630> foundation

if you see the camera moving right now

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.880 
if you see the camera moving right now

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
that's because one of my cats scrappy is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.560 
that's because one of my cats scrappy is
climbing<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.100> behind<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:04.160> camera<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:06.330> not

in a way but I wanted something closer
my<00:04:29.720> skin<00:04:30.110> color<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.940> might<00:04:32.240> be<00:04:32.420> a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
my skin color and that might be a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.270 
my skin color and that might be a
mistake<00:04:32.690> in<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.170> long<00:04:33.350> run<00:04:33.380> because<00:04:33.920> it's

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
mistake in the long run because it's

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.950 
mistake in the long run because it's
coming<00:04:34.640> up<00:04:34.790> it's<00:04:34.940> getting<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.300> little<00:04:35.420> warmer

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
coming up it's getting a little warmer

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.409 
coming up it's getting a little warmer
outside<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.280> may<00:04:37.460> need<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:37.850> darker<00:04:38.240> one

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
outside and I may need the darker one

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.100 
outside and I may need the darker one
but<00:04:38.960> will<00:04:39.380> say<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.860> try<00:04:40.490> not<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.850> go<00:04:41.630> into<00:04:41.780> sun

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
but will say I try not to go into sun

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.380 
but will say I try not to go into sun
too<00:04:42.290> much<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:42.890> hopefully<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:44.000> won't<00:04:44.150> be<00:04:44.360> a

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
too much so hopefully that won't be a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.590 
too much so hopefully that won't be a
problem<00:04:44.480> for<00:04:44.900> me<00:04:45.200> but<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.520> does<00:04:46.850> it's<00:04:47.210> smooth

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600

dry<00:06:17.089> dry<00:06:17.539> skin<00:06:17.929> I<00:06:18.139> think<00:06:18.499> this<00:06:18.619> will<00:06:18.770> work<00:06:18.830> for

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
dry dry skin I think this will work for

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.429 
dry dry skin I think this will work for
great<00:06:19.580> for<00:06:19.879> you<00:06:19.999> I'm<00:06:20.300> not<00:06:20.539> sure<00:06:20.869> if<00:06:21.169> it<00:06:21.319> would

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
great for you I'm not sure if it would

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.619 
great for you I'm not sure if it would
work<00:06:21.499> on<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:21.949> oily<00:06:22.279> skin<00:06:22.550> I<00:06:22.789> kind<00:06:23.059> of<00:06:23.209> doubt<00:06:23.389> it

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
work on the oily skin I kind of doubt it

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.149 
work on the oily skin I kind of doubt it
i<00:06:23.779> think<00:06:23.839> it<00:06:24.080> might<00:06:24.229> slip<00:06:24.559> off<00:06:24.740> your<00:06:24.770> face

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
i think it might slip off your face

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.809 
i think it might slip off your face
