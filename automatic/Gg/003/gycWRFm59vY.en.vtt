00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
past three to four years health so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670 
past three to four years health so
here's<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> thing<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.280> simple<00:01:05.640> math<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.750> order

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
here's the thing is simple math in order

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
here's the thing is simple math in order
to<00:01:07.770> gain<00:01:07.979> weight<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.640> need<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> increase<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to gain weight you need to increase the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.070 
to gain weight you need to increase the
amount<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> calories<00:01:11.070> more<00:01:11.880> than<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.810> your

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
amount of calories more than what your

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
amount of calories more than what your
body<00:01:13.380> burns<00:01:13.710> off<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.520> body<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.790> burned

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
body burns off so if your body is burned

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
body burns off so if your body is burned
off<00:01:15.180> 1,200<00:01:15.780> calories<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.110> day<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.650> you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
off 1,200 calories a day if you're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
off 1,200 calories a day if you're
putting<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.610> 1,200<00:01:18.150> calories<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.930> you're

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
putting in 1,200 calories then you're

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
putting in 1,200 calories then you're
just<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> steady<00:01:20.130> equilibrium

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
just going to be at a steady equilibrium

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.140 
just going to be at a steady equilibrium
so<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.610> pack<00:01:23.970> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so if you want to really really pack on

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
so if you want to really really pack on
some<00:01:24.360> size<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.020> need<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> double<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.220> amount

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
some size you need to double the amount

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.660 
some size you need to double the amount
of<00:01:26.790> calories<00:01:27.979> than<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.130> body<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.520> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
of calories than your body of this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.280 
of calories than your body of this
burning<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.540> example<00:01:30.630> Michael

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
burning off so for example Michael

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.370 
burning off so for example Michael
Phelps<00:01:31.729> because<00:01:32.729> he's<00:01:32.880> trained<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
Phelps because he's trained so much that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.420 
Phelps because he's trained so much that
motherfucker<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.640> takes<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:36.570> 10<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.439> 12,000

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
motherfucker in takes about 10 to 12,000

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
motherfucker in takes about 10 to 12,000

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
Marines was a definitely a great choice

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.760 
Marines was a definitely a great choice
and<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:47.190> benefits<00:05:47.669> that<00:05:47.729> I've<00:05:47.940> had<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.770> in

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.129 
and the benefits that I've had the in
terms<00:05:50.310> of<00:05:50.460> like<00:05:50.639> when<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.030> was<00:05:51.210> in<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:51.960> Marine

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
terms of like when I was in the Marine

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.219 
terms of like when I was in the Marine
Corps<00:05:52.430> during<00:05:53.430> like<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.669> active<00:05:54.180> portion<00:05:54.510> you

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
Corps during like the active portion you

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.670 
Corps during like the active portion you
get<00:05:55.440> full<00:05:55.830> dental<00:05:56.250> full<00:05:56.789> health<00:05:57.150> all<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.500> that

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
get full dental full health all of that

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.909 
get full dental full health all of that
and<00:05:58.919> you<00:05:59.610> get<00:05:59.870> money<00:06:00.870> for<00:06:01.110> education<00:06:01.229> called

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
and you get money for education called

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.129 
and you get money for education called
the<00:06:01.979> GI<00:06:02.190> Bill<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.789> get<00:06:02.970> your<00:06:03.240> meals<00:06:03.539> paid<00:06:03.870> for

the GI Bill you get your meals paid for

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.659 
the GI Bill you get your meals paid for
so<00:06:04.349> if<00:06:04.680> there's<00:06:05.070> definitely<00:06:05.340> a<00:06:05.400> lot<00:06:05.490> of

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.670 
so if there's definitely a lot of
benefits<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.300> think<00:06:06.570> you<00:06:07.260> become<00:06:07.620> a

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680
