00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
head and arrest them sounds like a

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.100 
head and arrest them sounds like a

a long time since I've seen an original

a long time since I've seen an original
arcade<00:00:56.080> machine<00:00:56.500> which<00:00:56.650> I<00:00:56.770> remember<00:00:56.949> being

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
arcade machine which I remember being

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.760 
arcade machine which I remember being
really<00:00:57.699> cool<00:00:57.910> this<00:00:58.480> version<00:00:58.930> on<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.140> Genesis

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
really cool this version on the Genesis

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.800 
really cool this version on the Genesis
comes<00:01:00.130> across<00:01:00.399> as<00:01:00.820> okay

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
comes across as okay

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.139 
comes across as okay
it's<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.380> terrific<00:01:02.649> arcade<00:01:03.310> style<00:01:03.579> game<00:01:03.730> that's

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
it's a terrific arcade style game that's

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's a terrific arcade style game that's
a<00:01:04.300> lot<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.809> fun<00:01:05.110> but<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.190> driving<00:01:06.640> controls

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
a lot of fun but the driving controls

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.600 
a lot of fun but the driving controls
could<00:01:07.360> have<00:01:07.630> been<00:01:07.960> better<00:01:08.200> I<00:01:08.530> like<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.460> they

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
could have been better I like that they

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.460 
could have been better I like that they
put<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> ramp<00:01:10.119> in<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:10.360> middle<00:01:10.690> of<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.290> road

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
put a ramp in the middle of the road

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.350 
put a ramp in the middle of the road
instead<00:01:11.649> of<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.979> turn<00:01:12.130> signal<00:01:12.340> just<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.180> think

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
instead of a turn signal just to think

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.910 
instead of a turn signal just to think
how<00:01:13.509> much<00:01:13.660> more<00:01:13.840> affordable<00:01:14.140> that<00:01:14.440> would<00:01:14.740> be

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
how much more affordable that would be

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.560 
how much more affordable that would be
you<00:01:15.490> just<00:01:15.670> need<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.940> make<00:01:16.060> sure<00:01:16.090> you're<00:01:16.360> going

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
you just need to make sure you're going

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
you just need to make sure you're going
fast<00:01:16.899> enough<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.229> clear<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.619> intersection

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 

chase<00:01:23.550> hq2<00:01:24.150> comes<00:01:24.630> across<00:01:24.870> as<00:01:25.200> average

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
chase hq2 comes across as average

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
chase hq2 comes across as average
because<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> gameplay<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.700> quite<00:01:27.120> as

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
because the gameplay is not quite as

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
because the gameplay is not quite as
smooth<00:01:27.660> as<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.620> outrun<00:01:29.160> or

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
smooth as it is in outrun or

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.420 
smooth as it is in outrun or
roadblasters<00:01:30.080> but<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.230> two-stage<00:01:31.800> gameplay

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
roadblasters but the two-stage gameplay

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
roadblasters but the two-stage gameplay
and<00:01:32.700> arcade<00:01:33.090> style<00:01:33.330> scoring<00:01:33.960> makes<00:01:34.260> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and arcade style scoring makes it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
and arcade style scoring makes it
totally<00:01:35.010> worth<00:01:35.160> playing<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:36.270> perhaps<00:01:36.480> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
totally worth playing so perhaps it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
totally worth playing so perhaps it
comes<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.140> above<00:01:37.410> average<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
comes out above average but I think that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.890 
comes out above average but I think that
they<00:01:38.880> could<00:01:38.940> have<00:01:39.090> done<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.360> better<00:01:39.450> job<00:01:39.870> with

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
they could have done a better job with

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
they could have done a better job with
the<00:01:40.140> presentation<00:01:40.800> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> genesis<00:01:41.550> because

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the presentation on the genesis because

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.220 
the presentation on the genesis because
other<00:01:41.970> games<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.480> done<00:01:42.750> better<00:01:42.930> like

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
other games have done better like

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.350 
other games have done better like
roadblasters<00:01:43.680> another<00:01:44.550> really<00:01:45.000> fun<00:01:45.180> game

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
roadblasters another really fun game

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.910 
roadblasters another really fun game
that<00:01:45.510> suffered<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.840> sloppy<00:01:46.260> driving<00:01:46.770> but

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that suffered from sloppy driving but

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.320 
that suffered from sloppy driving but
it's<00:01:47.040> passable<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.730> it's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.940> cool<00:01:48.120> game

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
it's passable because it's a cool game

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.810 
it's passable because it's a cool game
what<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.170> were<00:01:49.410> watching<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.160> first<00:01:50.400> stage

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
what we were watching is the first stage

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.430 
what we were watching is the first stage
of<00:01:50.970> gameplay<00:01:51.360> where<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.780> given<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.170> certain

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
of gameplay where you're given a certain

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.500 
of gameplay where you're given a certain
amount<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.800> time<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.220> catch<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.790> bad<00:01:53.970> guy<00:01:54.240> if

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
amount of time to catch the bad guy if

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.210 
amount of time to catch the bad guy if
you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.260> catch<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:55.860> I've<00:01:56.010> done<00:01:56.160> here

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
you can catch them which I've done here

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.490 
you can catch them which I've done here
you're<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.820> given<00:01:57.150> more<00:01:57.390> time<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:58.170> crash

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you're then given more time to crash

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
you're then given more time to crash
into<00:01:58.710> them<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.160> make<00:01:59.400> them<00:01:59.580> catch<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.000> fire<00:02:00.270> if

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
into them and make them catch on fire if

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.570 
into them and make them catch on fire if
you<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.900> complete<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.710> objectives<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
you don't complete your objectives the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.140 
you don't complete your objectives the
game<00:02:02.729> ends<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.660> forced<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.260> continue

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.539 

in<00:02:11.239> each<00:02:12.019> level<00:02:12.290> you've<00:02:12.620> got<00:02:12.830> three<00:02:13.129> turbo

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
in each level you've got three turbo

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.520 
in each level you've got three turbo
powers<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.690> use<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.140> increase<00:02:15.349> your
