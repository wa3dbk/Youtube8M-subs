00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.059
 well and we go back to talking about what 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.519
 what is happening in baja california 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.289
 south to the link to my partner 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.820
 german to medrano the correspondent in this 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.560
 place who has more details of what 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.830
 what is happening with the odile step 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.600
 german and we are with you good night 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.160
 hello how about very good night for hello 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.540
 Well, finally they have been 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.150
 difficult hours here in baja california 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.550
 south still energy is not restored 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.140
 electric here in the state and also 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.220
 well, there's no 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.700
 fuels for automobiles 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.190
 say they are the two main because 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.040
 impediments have meant that there 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 now a lack of communication between 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.230
 many sectors here in baja california 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 south 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.440
 I also comment under which go 2.155 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.080
 the people who have been sheltered 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.820
 here in the city of peace 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:03.840
 and well, it is expected that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.450
 are therefore about 15 thousand 5,000 more in all 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 Baja California Sur is three are the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.800
 total figures the hotel sector 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.800
 also on his part he has released 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.729
 that of the 26 thousand foreigners that 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.369
 they have six thousand are part of 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.410
 nationals and they were found let's say 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.780
 at the height of the hurricane 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.820
 the duly guarded all the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.310
 hotel infrastructure that therefore does not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.440
 suffered some slight damage nothing more and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.960
 also some floods that do not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.420
 happen to older I tell you that they are still 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.930
 closed roads that connect to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.870
 peace 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.000
 so it is expected that the 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.860
 runoff and re talk again 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.260
 note circulation since 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.000
 the rains and some bent continue 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.250
 here in the state 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.320
 another unfortunate situation is that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.390
 well we woke up here in the capital 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.450
 with the novelty that many businesses 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.450
 they had lost their facades and their 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 security measures in many ports 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.390
 many windows and many showcases were 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.910
 finally destroyed by the passage of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.130
 hurricane or the here in the state and it's 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.860
 why this night many of those in 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.190
 traders fear that there is rapine here 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.050
 in baja california south on the part of then 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.540
 people that ill-intentioned want 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.160
 take advantage of the situation paula and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.420
 on this subject fernÃ¡n consulted you 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.430
 tell us a bit how the streets are 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.570
 As for the police guard, we have already 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.700
 seen that looting has been recorded 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.560
 people who are not just looking 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.180
 food they are even taking out drinks 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.549
 alcoholic 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 effectively as well says it is has 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.150
 there were some looting in some 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.280
 shops in some restaurants by 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.030
 part of this the streets so good 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.439
 finally, there is very little security 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.010
 can be offered by the state because 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.930
 It is not exceeded in this situation 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.939
 there are elements that are giving the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.340
 regular rondines that got used to 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.810
 to certain colonies and much less in the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.129
 first picture of the city where 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.709
 find these businesses and these 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.989
 restaurants told you that there are already 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.879
 of some shipments from other states 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.310
 brothers of baja california sinaloa and 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.470
 sound here to baja california south 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.420
 are being moved at this time 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.880
 to support these activities of 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.349
 security and safeguard just like for 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.900
 the restoration of energy 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.670
 electrical and also the reset 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.230
 of drinking water 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.319
 paola because this is also another point 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.360
 important if there is no drinking water because 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.120
 finally there is no energy that can 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.160
 activate the water system pumps 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.860
 potable water and sewage system and this will be the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.920
 second night and apparently dark in 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.450
 70% of the capital and without water is the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.010
 situation right now in baja california south 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.660
 paula and that's what the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.459
 authorities report on the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.569
 services or I ask you about what I 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.709
 you are saying on the one hand water 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.950
 drinking and also the subject of 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.750
 electricity that they are is an amount 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.459
 enormous the one of posts that has lost 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.799
 Federal electricity commission there 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.019
 many of cables finally plucked 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.450
 of the posts there are others that have fallen 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.720
 up cars and well this 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.950
 situation is putting many from 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.160
 federal commission of electricity to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.080
 redouble efforts and wait for this help 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.269
 that comes from the brothers states for 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.250
 that is restored as soon as possible 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.799
 here energy and water is the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.900
 that's what the governor of the state said 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.580
 the most recent board meeting 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 the state civil protection 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.270
 basic services are those 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.070
 first they have to resume and it's 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.900
 the order for all members of the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.790
 state civil protection council 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.470
 paula well in the hostels continue 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.300
 so this also stops the 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.830
 people know it and those who need it 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.150
 You can still go German 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.620
