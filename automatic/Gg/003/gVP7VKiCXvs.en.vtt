sequence<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.119> strip<00:01:09.390> file<00:01:09.689> let's<00:01:10.409> take<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
sequence in a strip file let's take a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
sequence in a strip file let's take a
look<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.420> basically<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.720> option<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
look first basically what this option is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
look first basically what this option is
they<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.680> stitch<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.549> each<00:01:14.880> frame

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
they can stitch all of this each frame

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.649 
they can stitch all of this each frame
into<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.810> single<00:01:16.290> large<00:01:17.070> PNG<00:01:17.670> file<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
into one single large PNG file which is

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
into one single large PNG file which is
very<00:01:18.900> useful<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.530> example<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
very useful for example if you want to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.770 
very useful for example if you want to
use<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> image<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.479> background<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
use this image as the background of a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.219 
use this image as the background of a
HTML<00:01:24.780> elements<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.280> css3<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:28.049> its

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
HTML elements and use css3 to make its

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
HTML elements and use css3 to make its
animate<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> fly-in

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
animate so that you can have a fly-in

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
animate so that you can have a fly-in
dark<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.640> some<00:01:32.689> some<00:01:33.689> HTML<00:01:34.490> elements

the way to control how your animation is
played<00:02:58.030> where<00:02:58.270> it's<00:02:58.450> located<00:02:58.630> or<00:02:59.230> attach<00:03:00.220> some

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
played where it's located or attach some

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.160 
played where it's located or attach some
additional<00:03:00.940> movement<00:03:01.390> such<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:01.660> in<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.110> case

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
additional movement such as in this case

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.880 
additional movement such as in this case
or<00:03:02.650> translate<00:03:03.450> something<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.750> yep

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
or translate something like that yep

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.210 
or translate something like that yep
I<00:03:05.920> think<00:03:06.340> all<00:03:06.670> these<00:03:07.060> options<00:03:07.500> are<00:03:08.500> very<00:03:08.890> very

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
I think all these options are very very

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.580 
I think all these options are very very
useful<00:03:09.459> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
useful and
