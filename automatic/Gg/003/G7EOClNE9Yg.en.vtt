micro<00:00:03.929> project<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.670> what<00:00:05.910> are<00:00:06.029> these

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
micro project going on so what are these

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.280 
micro project going on so what are these
things<00:00:06.210> they<00:00:06.990> are<00:00:08.240> sonotubes<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.660> concrete

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
things they are sonotubes for concrete

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.359 
things they are sonotubes for concrete
so<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> cut<00:00:13.920> them<00:00:14.040> into<00:00:14.280> 12<00:00:15.120> inch<00:00:16.250> segments<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
so I cut them into 12 inch segments I

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.400 
so I cut them into 12 inch segments I
guess<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> could<00:00:17.880> say<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.420> did<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
guess you could say I did it on the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.769 
guess you could say I did it on the
table<00:00:19.830> saw<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.670> wouldn't<00:00:21.029> recommend<00:00:21.330> doing

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
table saw and I wouldn't recommend doing

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.519 
table saw and I wouldn't recommend doing
it<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.260> way

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it that way

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.330 
it that way
because<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:24.119> seemed<00:00:24.390> pretty<00:00:24.660> dangerous<00:00:25.350> but

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
because it seemed pretty dangerous but

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.529 
because it seemed pretty dangerous but
that's<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> did<00:00:27.269> it

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539
