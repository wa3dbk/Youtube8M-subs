on the display there if I can waggle it
about<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.670> we've<00:01:11.850> got<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
about and so we've got to do some bit of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
about and so we've got to do some bit of
volume<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.400> work<00:01:14.700> shows<00:01:15.030> how

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
volume going on there so work shows how

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
volume going on there so work shows how
this<00:01:15.330> thing<00:01:15.540> works<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.380> basically

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this thing works like well basically

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.109 
this thing works like well basically
enemies<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.220> said<00:01:17.460> already<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.820> basically

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
car audio Tillery input right you then

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.289 
car audio Tillery input right you then
basically<00:01:24.990> hold<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> close<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.070> head<00:01:26.299> you

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.310 

it<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.910> does<00:01:39.060> some<00:01:39.210> audio<00:01:39.480> trickery<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> at

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it then does some audio trickery and at

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.870 
it then does some audio trickery and at
that<00:01:40.410> point<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.100> espied<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.670> car

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that point it's now be espied your car

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
that point it's now be espied your car
so<00:01:42.120> it's<00:01:42.240> basically<00:01:42.510> set<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.440> new<00:01:43.620> levels

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
we're listening from your position mark

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.369 
we're listening from your position mark
okay<00:02:48.969> now<00:02:49.239> we'll<00:02:49.420> turn<00:02:49.599> up<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:49.959> music<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.260> bit

speakers playing stuff I had a stereo
image<00:03:29.739> across<00:03:30.219> the<00:03:30.370> frozen<00:03:30.549> -<00:03:31.000> well<00:03:31.239> how<00:03:31.359> does

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
image across the frozen - well how does

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.659 
image across the frozen - well how does
he<00:03:31.599> do<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.859> little<00:03:33.129> box<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.609> a

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
he do that that is a little box with a

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.229 
he do that that is a little box with a
lot<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.819> power

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
lot of power

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.209 
lot of power
absolutely<00:03:35.019> Adam<00:03:35.230> well<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.530> mean<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.859> I<00:03:36.159> said

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.800 
he's doing is looking at the way the
sound<00:03:39.609> is<00:03:39.760> actually<00:03:39.879> performing<00:03:40.449> in<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.599> car

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
sound is actually performing in the car

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.270 
sound is actually performing in the car
taking<00:03:41.530> some<00:03:41.709> measurements<00:03:42.099> and<00:03:42.159> then

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
taking some measurements and then

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.069 
taking some measurements and then
setting<00:03:42.699> those<00:03:42.819> measurements<00:03:43.419> up<00:03:43.569> not<00:03:44.049> only

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
setting those measurements up not only

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.020 
setting those measurements up not only
tonally<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:44.859> also<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.220> terms<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.519> timing<00:03:45.790> as

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
tonally but also in terms of timing as

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.479 
tonally but also in terms of timing as
well<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.780> effectively<00:03:47.199> it's<00:03:47.409> correcting<00:03:48.010> for

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
well so effectively it's correcting for

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.309 
well so effectively it's correcting for
the<00:03:48.639> positions<00:03:49.120> your<00:03:49.329> speaker<00:03:49.750> your<00:03:50.049> car

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
the positions your speaker your car

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.740 
the positions your speaker your car
speakers<00:03:50.680> are<00:03:50.799> in<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.159> therefore<00:03:51.669> giving<00:03:52.629> you

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
speakers are in and therefore giving you

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.000 
speakers are in and therefore giving you
an<00:03:52.870> image<00:03:53.109> which<00:03:53.349> you<00:03:53.379> wouldn't<00:03:53.769> be<00:03:53.859> able<00:03:53.919> to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
an image which you wouldn't be able to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.039 
an image which you wouldn't be able to
get<00:03:54.129> normally<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:54.849> in<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.689> meanwhile<00:03:55.930> of

course<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.379> various<00:03:56.620> little<00:03:56.889> parameters

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
course the various little parameters

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.520 
course the various little parameters
that<00:03:57.519> are<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.729> this<00:03:57.849> thing<00:03:57.909> um<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:59.049> can<00:03:59.290> mess

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
that are on this thing um you can mess

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.960 
that are on this thing um you can mess
with<00:03:59.560> slightly<00:03:59.949> so<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.250> could<00:04:00.519> turn<00:04:00.669> the<00:04:00.819> bass

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
with slightly so you could turn the bass

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.270 
with slightly so you could turn the bass
up<00:04:01.000> or<00:04:01.389> down<00:04:01.629> one<00:04:02.349> marked<00:04:02.590> impact<00:04:02.859> is<00:04:03.099> I

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
up or down one marked impact is I

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.849 
up or down one marked impact is I
suppose<00:04:03.519> mid<00:04:03.849> band<00:04:04.030> but<00:04:04.239> there's<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.530> whole
