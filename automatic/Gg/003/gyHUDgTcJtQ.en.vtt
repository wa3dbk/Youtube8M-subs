in a foundry and product on this is the
C<00:00:17.240> 160<00:00:18.240> P<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> collaboration<00:00:20.460> with

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the front which is interesting I think

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
the front which is interesting I think
that's<00:00:25.529> why<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.740> named<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.580> foundry

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that's why they named it the the foundry

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.400 
that's why they named it the the foundry

interesting these are made in golden got
that<00:00:45.480> wire<00:00:45.690> pocket<00:00:46.140> clip<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.649> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that wire pocket clip on there and you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
that wire pocket clip on there and you
can<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> comes<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.460> paper<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
can see it comes a little paper with the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
can see it comes a little paper with the
clip<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.170> against<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> stainless<00:00:50.399> handle

clip up against the stainless handle

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.799 
clip up against the stainless handle
skill<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> thought<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.239> was<00:00:51.329> interesting<00:00:51.449> we

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
skill I thought that was interesting we

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
skill I thought that was interesting we
pull<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.350> put<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.530> right<00:00:52.620> back

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
pull it out and put it right back

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
pull it out and put it right back
there's<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> lanyard<00:00:54.210> hole<00:00:54.360> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.199> wider

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there's the lanyard hole kind of a wider

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.580 
there's the lanyard hole kind of a wider
bigger<00:00:56.370> blade<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.109> unique<00:00:58.379> thing

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
bigger blade but one really unique thing

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
bigger blade but one really unique thing
is<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.190> thinner<00:00:59.430> than<00:00:59.550> most<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.239> would

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
is as a lot thinner than most I would

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.389 
is as a lot thinner than most I would
say<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> thinner<00:01:01.350> than<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> sage<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
say this is thinner than the sage I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
say this is thinner than the sage I
actually<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.149> my<00:01:03.239> stage<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.690> pocket

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
actually have my stage in my pocket

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
actually have my stage in my pocket
right<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.199> I'll<00:01:04.530> pull<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.010> there's<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
right here I'll pull that out there's a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.820 
right here I'll pull that out there's a
comparison<00:01:06.390> next<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> sage<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.680> see

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
comparison next to the sage you can see

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.390 
comparison next to the sage you can see
those<00:01:07.950> scales<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.430> slightly<00:01:08.729> thinner<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:10.400> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
those scales are slightly thinner and so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.980 
those scales are slightly thinner and so
it<00:01:11.640> gives<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.090> sleeker<00:01:12.570> feel<00:01:12.840> slimmer<00:01:13.650> feel

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.179 

look<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.560> comparison

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
look at it there's a little comparison

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.690 
look at it there's a little comparison
side-by-side<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.330> impromptu

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
side-by-side a little impromptu

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.830 
side-by-side a little impromptu
side-by-side<00:01:23.700> comparison<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> sage<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
side-by-side comparison of the sage a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
side-by-side comparison of the sage a
little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> wider<00:01:28.290> blade<00:01:28.590> longer<00:01:29.400> blade

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.399 
interested to see what you guys have to
say<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.210> frame<00:01:42.210> lock<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> see

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
say about this frame lock you can see

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.139 
say about this frame lock you can see
right<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.070> frame<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.549> has<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.880> over

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
right there on the frame it has an over

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.330 
right there on the frame it has an over
travel<00:01:45.420> stop<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> frame<00:01:46.920> won't<00:01:47.130> travel

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
travel stop so the frame won't travel

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
travel stop so the frame won't travel
any<00:01:47.610> farther<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.770> really<00:01:49.770> smooth<00:01:50.189> knife<00:01:51.560> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
any farther out really smooth knife so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
any farther out really smooth knife so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it walks there check out the detent very

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.130 
it walks there check out the detent very
nice<00:01:58.229> very<00:01:59.070> smooth<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.420> wide<00:02:00.719> and
