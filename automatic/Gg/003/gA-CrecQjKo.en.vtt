00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 nice to all the guys that orgasm inc 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.480
 that we are with the second episode of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.160
 rat glory fortunately I will succeed 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 probably in the future to find more 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.870
 space that is more time to make videos e 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.269
 so more videos will come out the week 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.460
 maybe two or three here's how 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.820
 you saw a christodoulos taken at 300 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.400
 No 420 credits really very little 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.350
 however let's start immediately I said but 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.580
 this is a very quiet series 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.650
 very simple because we have to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 complicate life with a thousand rules me 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.340
 a big bullshit came to mind 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.980
 so then I decided to introduce 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 only the rule of the fact that if you mark a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.100
 Zazza will take a thousand credits per goal 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 so what does this mean that the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 series will be much faster because 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 however zaza makes so many goals and as you see 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 already here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 and so I can also take players 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 more expensive stronger for example than ne 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.620
 I know maybe you can venture to sell a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.750
 promos that if I am not mistaken it costs 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.040
 so much and therefore and therefore would come second 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 me the series would be even more 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.860
 pretty without doing anyway before and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.270
 I have to say that your ideas are there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 the comments really were 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 interesting that probably 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 I will use and in a later series that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.770
 I already know what series I will do but in the future 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.299
 now I won't let you know anything anyway 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 you have seen a thousand credits won in 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.799
 sense that it is beautiful presario fifth trento 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.310
 only 200 credits, however, the thousand credits 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.060
 are of the goal precisely of zaza 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 I have also taken flororo to do the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
 perfect chemistry with zaza but why me 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 he seemed one of the attackers of the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.280
 series to stronger 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.030
 obviously it has a noticeable price 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 complicated bass was 500 well 500 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 630 credits I don't remember anyway 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 immediately comes a great goal from zaza from 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.509
 out-of-area of ​​left Zaza boys is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 really great I paid 250 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.909
 credits 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.280
 the first episode and that is now I believe 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.080
 who is on 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.470
 a thousand credits something like this is there 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.180
 so much the price went up because 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.300
 really people have noticed 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.330
 this player clearly in my opinion 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.830
 this player is really hot 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.220
 in fact this game is the second 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.270
 game z is unleashed we are already at the third 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.940
 goal and I would not say a third bullshit 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.410
 goal from zaza comes a goal of flower 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.230
 flores double florus flores that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.320
 really a very interesting striker 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.110
 physical strength excellent shot with one 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.150
 then a decent speed penalty 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.519
 we got four goals if 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.910
 zahedan's mistake must be seen 4 with of 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.430
 zaza this means 4,000 credits per 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.290
 17 0 the opponent wasn't all I'm 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.280
 much or maybe because I'm from a 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.269
 phenomenon I don't know anyway I take badu 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 to those who love badu I have to say that I don't know 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.690
 because I take this every year 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.080
 player not in the series but I had it 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.239
 got so to play me and annie every 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.829
 year satisfies me and so I decided to 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 also take it for this series to like 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.730
 you saw I had changed the form in 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.459
 4 1 2 1 2 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.410
 yes maybe I put one too many in 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.000
 against an opponent in the last game 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.940
 which is perhaps the best team 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.459
 team that met in this 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:31.459
 series in the first two episodes la des anges 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.980
 the house therefore are good players later 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.070
 a great action I can make goals 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.430
 with zaza that puts its stamp in every 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.670
 incredible game too strong and there 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.690
 advice just buy it eyes 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.130
 closed 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 in fact here is the goal of zaza what is there 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.780
 to say 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.560
 a bob bob then zaza did two here 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.300
 goal that this means 2000 credits 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.040
 therefore the episode has come to an end 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.100
 what I wanted to say to you I don't remember anymore 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.340
 axes obviously still recommended i 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.110
 players to buy but there is look 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.670
 even the credits that or why some me 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.800
 they said take this take races 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.250
 40 billion in credits this year 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.829
 I have a budget so you must now 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.670
 that is about 6,000 credits therefore 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.250
 advise me of the players to take 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.800
 with 6 thousand credits or less for the next one 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.480
 episode so let a nice I like it 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.830
 a commentary of course sign up the 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.350
 channel if you haven't done it yet 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.550
 see you at the next episode that will be 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.419
 I think in two or three days 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.419
 What's up guys
