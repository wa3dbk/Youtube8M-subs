00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.590
 March I have to say that practically 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.210
 in the beginning I found them all very much 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 interesting 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.590
 but I must say that in the end I am 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 remained a little disappointed then we take the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310
 first product 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.689
 then I was asked to 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 recommend a hair product 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.650

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.690

 huge and therefore not very much 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.630
