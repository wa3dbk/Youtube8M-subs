00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cut in half and I actually reviewed this

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
cut in half and I actually reviewed this
before<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.890> you've<00:01:29.160> seen<00:01:29.399> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
before and as you if you've seen that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
before and as you if you've seen that
one<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.030> used<00:01:30.179> to<00:01:30.270> use<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.479> believe<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.720> 10<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> 1

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
one they used to use I believe a 10 to 1

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
one they used to use I believe a 10 to 1
and<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.440> was<00:01:31.679> cut<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.700> full<00:01:32.940> ten<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.360> cut

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and that was cut one full ten to one cut

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210 
and that was cut one full ten to one cut
in<00:01:33.720> half<00:01:33.899> now<00:01:33.929> they<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.470> use<00:01:34.649> one<00:01:34.830> four<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
in half now they just use one four to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
in half now they just use one four to
one<00:01:35.340> patty<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.509> works<00:01:36.660> like<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.800> it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
one patty and it works like that so it's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.560 
one patty and it works like that so it's
pretty<00:01:38.429> much<00:01:38.550> all<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> good<00:01:38.970> flavors<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.390> Big

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
gotta say it's still just as good as I

remember<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.570> you're<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> fan<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> Big<00:01:49.320> Mac

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
remember if you're a fan of the Big Mac

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
remember if you're a fan of the Big Mac
you're<00:01:49.680> definitely<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> love<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.640> not

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you're definitely going to love this not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670 
you're definitely going to love this not
only<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.630> cheaper<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.320> only<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
only is it cheaper not only is it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.850 
only is it cheaper not only is it
somewhat<00:01:53.159> healthier<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.350> also<00:01:55.350> tastes

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
somewhat healthier it also tastes

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
somewhat healthier it also tastes
exactly<00:01:56.220> like<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.790> Big<00:01:57.060> Mac<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.780> think

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
exactly like a Big Mac and I think

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.179 
exactly like a Big Mac and I think
that's<00:01:58.110> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> obviously<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> whole<00:01:58.950> point

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
that's kind of obviously the whole point

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.410 
that's kind of obviously the whole point
with<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.640> personally<00:01:59.759> think<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
with this I personally think it's a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
with this I personally think it's a
better<00:02:00.570> value<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> Big<00:02:01.320> Mac<00:02:01.470> because<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
better value than the Big Mac because I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.050 
better value than the Big Mac because I
mean<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.430> one<00:02:02.520> thing<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.729> don't<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.970> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
mean you for one thing you don't have to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
mean you for one thing you don't have to
eat<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> much<00:02:03.570> food<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
eat all that much food and you get it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.149 
eat all that much food and you get it
that<00:02:04.500> much<00:02:04.680> cheaper

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
that much cheaper

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.490 
that much cheaper
I'd<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.060> say<00:02:06.180> about<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> 7<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> 10<00:02:07.079> for

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I'd have to say about a 7 out of 10 for

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
I'd have to say about a 7 out of 10 for
the<00:02:07.979> taste<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.459> mean<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> tastes<00:02:08.910> pretty<00:02:09.030> good

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

overall<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.350> think<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> best<00:02:10.799> way<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> get

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
overall but I think the best way to get

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.620 
overall but I think the best way to get
this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.459> honestly<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.910> some<00:02:12.030> red<00:02:12.209> onion<00:02:12.510> and
