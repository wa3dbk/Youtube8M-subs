00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
a mere some trouble clouds not on that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.420 
a mere some trouble clouds not on that
level<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:17.910> Collazo<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.750> definitely<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.560> very

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
level but Collazo is definitely a very

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
thought he was able to overwhelm him

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.440 
thought he was able to overwhelm him
with<00:02:24.930> his<00:02:25.200> speed<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.739> his<00:02:25.920> reach<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:27.150> sean

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
with his speed and his reach when sean

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.539 
with his speed and his reach when sean
is<00:02:27.780> at<00:02:28.079> his<00:02:28.230> best<00:02:28.260> imagine<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.370> know<00:02:29.459> if

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
that tough dog pressure that he has with

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.710 
that tough dog pressure that he has with
that<00:02:34.379> break<00:02:34.739> Aamir<00:02:35.040> Khan<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:36.090> will<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.569> don't

that break Aamir Khan is will I don't

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.490 
that break Aamir Khan is will I don't
think<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.079> don't<00:02:37.200> think<00:02:37.379> that's<00:02:37.680> necessarily<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
think I don't think that's necessarily a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.360 
think I don't think that's necessarily a
mirror<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:40.829> don't<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.250> that's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
mirror and you know I don't think that's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.270 
mirror and you know I don't think that's
necessarily<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.120> wait<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.840> beat<00:02:43.110> I'm<00:02:43.980> here

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.020 
yes I see points in the fight where
Amira<00:03:16.769> could<00:03:16.950> take<00:03:17.130> control<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.819> other

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
Amira could take control and in other

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.520 
Amira could take control and in other
points<00:03:18.359> with<00:03:18.510> Sean<00:03:18.720> comes<00:03:18.959> back<00:03:19.230> into<00:03:19.410> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
