00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
Spartan super soldier so you have to be

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.180 
Spartan super soldier so you have to be
careful<00:06:11.620> about<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.070> fights<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.400> you<00:06:12.580> pick

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.710 
careful about the fights that you pick
and<00:06:13.520> one<00:06:13.880> thing<00:06:13.910> that's<00:06:14.150> cool<00:06:14.360> is<00:06:14.480> that<00:06:14.510> the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
and one thing that's cool is that the

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.810 
and one thing that's cool is that the
pistol<00:06:15.050> actually<00:06:15.380> has<00:06:15.680> soo<00:06:16.070> min<00:06:16.280> it<00:06:16.460> and<00:06:16.640> it

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
seems pretty powerful just to list

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.230 
seems pretty powerful just to list
pretty<00:06:18.470> powerful<00:06:18.770> once<00:06:19.670> you<00:06:19.820> take<00:06:20.000> down<00:06:20.120> an

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
pretty powerful once you take down an

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.850 
pretty powerful once you take down an
enemy<00:06:20.360> shield<00:06:20.780> switching<00:06:21.320> to<00:06:21.380> your<00:06:21.500> pistol

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
enemy shield switching to your pistol

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.180 
enemy shield switching to your pistol
single<00:06:22.790> shot<00:06:23.000> head<00:06:23.240> shot<00:06:23.450> kills<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.710> in<00:06:25.040> that

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
single shot head shot kills so in that

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.220 
single shot head shot kills so in that
way<00:06:25.250> it<00:06:25.490> works<00:06:25.700> a<00:06:25.820> lot<00:06:26.000> like<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.570> halo<00:06:27.020> one

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
way it works a lot like the halo one

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.040 
way it works a lot like the halo one
pistol<00:06:27.680> that's<00:06:28.130> got<00:06:28.340> a<00:06:28.370> little<00:06:28.490> bit<00:06:28.700> of<00:06:28.730> zoom

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
pistol that's got a little bit of zoom

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.300 
pistol that's got a little bit of zoom
fires<00:06:30.050> just<00:06:30.380> as<00:06:30.560> quick<00:06:30.740> as<00:06:30.770> you<00:06:30.920> can<00:06:30.950> hold<00:06:31.220> the

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
fires just as quick as you can hold the

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.940 
fires just as quick as you can hold the
trigger<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:31.820> again<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.780> one-shot<00:06:33.380> headshot<00:06:33.770> on

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
trigger and again a one-shot headshot on

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620 
trigger and again a one-shot headshot on
unshielded<00:06:34.280> enemies<00:06:34.790> so<00:06:35.360> this<00:06:35.480> actually

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
unshielded enemies so this actually

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.420 
unshielded enemies so this actually
feels<00:06:35.930> a<00:06:36.110> little<00:06:36.140> bit<00:06:36.470> closer<00:06:36.800> to<00:06:36.950> the<00:06:37.070> Master

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
feels a little bit closer to the Master

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.070 
feels a little bit closer to the Master
Chief<00:06:37.640> that<00:06:37.850> we<00:06:37.970> experienced<00:06:38.510> in<00:06:38.570> Halo<00:06:38.870> one

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
Chief that we experienced in Halo one

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.810 
Chief that we experienced in Halo one
what<00:06:39.680> was<00:06:39.770> the<00:06:39.890> reasoning<00:06:40.250> behind<00:06:40.310> kind<00:06:40.760> of

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
what was the reasoning behind kind of

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.220 
what was the reasoning behind kind of
pulling<00:06:41.180> back<00:06:41.480> from<00:06:41.510> you<00:06:42.020> know<00:06:42.050> that

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
pulling back from you know that

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.170 
pulling back from you know that
overpowered<00:06:42.860> Master<00:06:43.160> Chief<00:06:43.370> that<00:06:43.820> we<00:06:43.880> had<00:06:44.030> by

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
overpowered Master Chief that we had by

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.840 
overpowered Master Chief that we had by
halo<00:06:44.420> 3<00:06:44.690> yeah<00:06:45.140> I<00:06:45.170> think<00:06:45.380> in<00:06:45.740> the<00:06:46.040> halo<00:06:46.220> games<00:06:46.550> as

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
halo 3 yeah I think in the halo games as

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.760 
halo 3 yeah I think in the halo games as
the<00:06:47.180> challenges<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:47.930> Master<00:06:48.230> Chief<00:06:48.410> chicon

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
the challenges the Master Chief chicon

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.320 
the challenges the Master Chief chicon
got<00:06:49.010> bigger<00:06:49.190> and<00:06:49.280> bigger<00:06:49.400> he<00:06:50.030> needed<00:06:50.270> to

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
got bigger and bigger he needed to

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.820 
got bigger and bigger he needed to
become<00:06:50.630> more<00:06:50.810> powerful<00:06:50.990> really<00:06:51.560> become

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
become more powerful really become

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.610 
become more powerful really become
superhuman<00:06:52.430> so<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.540> halo<00:06:53.750> 3<00:06:54.080> Master<00:06:54.440> Chief

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
superhuman so the halo 3 Master Chief

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.800 
superhuman so the halo 3 Master Chief
runs<00:06:54.980> really<00:06:55.190> fast<00:06:55.310> can<00:06:55.850> jump<00:06:56.150> over<00:06:56.330> a<00:06:56.450> brute

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
runs really fast can jump over a brute

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.630 
runs really fast can jump over a brute
can<00:06:57.380> get<00:06:57.560> in<00:06:57.710> and<00:06:57.830> out<00:06:57.920> of<00:06:57.980> combat<00:06:58.250> really

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
can get in and out of combat really

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.180 
can get in and out of combat really
easily<00:06:58.970> that's<00:06:59.930> one<00:07:00.080> feel<00:07:00.320> right<00:07:00.560> for<00:07:00.590> an<00:07:00.800> ODST

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
easily that's one feel right for an ODST

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.730 
easily that's one feel right for an ODST
so<00:07:01.880> we<00:07:02.000> wanted<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:02.360> return<00:07:02.870> to<00:07:03.020> basics<00:07:03.410> in<00:07:03.560> some

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
so we wanted to return to basics in some

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.950 
so we wanted to return to basics in some
ways<00:07:04.090> make<00:07:05.090> you<00:07:05.240> feel<00:07:05.420> a<00:07:05.480> little<00:07:05.540> bit<00:07:05.780> more

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
ways make you feel a little bit more

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.660 
ways make you feel a little bit more
like<00:07:06.170> the<00:07:06.260> chief<00:07:06.470> didn't<00:07:06.740> halo<00:07:06.920> one<00:07:07.220> more<00:07:07.490> like

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.670 
like the chief didn't halo one more like

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.000 
like the chief didn't halo one more like
a<00:07:07.700> real<00:07:08.210> person<00:07:08.510> on<00:07:08.870> a<00:07:08.930> Spartan<00:07:09.440> super<00:07:09.680> soldier

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.160 
a real person on a Spartan super soldier
so<00:07:10.940> that's<00:07:11.120> really<00:07:11.240> why<00:07:11.390> we<00:07:11.630> made<00:07:11.810> the<00:07:11.930> tweaks

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170
