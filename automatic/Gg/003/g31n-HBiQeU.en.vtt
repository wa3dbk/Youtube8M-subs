00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone I'm pink and we're here 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.099
 with a new video toys I bring you new 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.139
 formations that could come out in fifa 16 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.809
 since for me it would be a way of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.809
 hook people more to the game because 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.390
 for me there and they take it a long time 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.460
 putting the same formations so 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.710
 It would be very good if they put new 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.350
 formations had brought us a long 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 1516 video so I would love it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.810
 come back to that figure of 100 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.719
 likes would be very very good and good would see 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.210
 that you would like to see more episodes like 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 these new formations in this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 episode I'm just going to bring you two 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 formations that could come out but I have 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.489
 thought many more 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.340
 so if we get to those 100 likes 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.500
 Well, I'm going to ask you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.020
 incorporate them with a video on the channel 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 then we start with the first 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.710
 training I do not want this video to be 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 make very very long so we will go 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 pretty fast as you see the first 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 formation that you have in you 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 screens is a 5 2 2 1 in this lustrum 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.660
 God, I have put a form 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 and then in others in another service that 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.470
 I would surely put two formations 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.360
 totally different but I have been 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 occurred this formation and its variant 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.730
 that would also be fine so 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 Well, I start talking about how it exists 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.140
 a like 521 said we could with a hundred 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.479
 defenses as you see here the three 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.190
 central defenses and the lane 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.460
 right and the left lane in 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.850
 we would have the goalkeeper 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.009
 then this training would be and then 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.960
 preferred of two defensive midfielders 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.110
 that would be ahead of the axes 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.420
 central the truth this formation and day 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.670
 of luxury pile because it would be very very 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.280
 good and I 'm telling you because those 2,500 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.830
 centers would help a lot in defense to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.009
 the three central ones and they would form a 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.070
 defense of seven men and if the two 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.410
 lanes of semi body to defense 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.390
 so we would have a very very defense 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.140
 good with this training and then in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.380
 attack if we had two 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.630
 work high and high as they could also 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.209
 incorporate perfectly to the attack and 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.150
 be four or five men to attack 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.360
 that would also be luxury then I have 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.730
 put the band players in mc or 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.340
 it is a formation that looks like 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.980
 much to one that is currently in the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.770
 fifa 16 who are with four defenses and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.200
 three mc2 and then the df and that's why 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.410
 I have decided to put these 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.120
 mt band players or so I would go 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.790
 very good because in principle they would be 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.010
 for bands but they would have a lot to go 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.900
 to by the middle then I would also have 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580
 the middle cadres and players with 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.560
 quality of course because the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.300
 services are always with a mandate and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.360
 if not then it could always be reconverted 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.560
 a quick center forward to one of the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.560
 submitted and so we would have 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.350
 then he would go to the last player of the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.560
 team that would be the df and here there is already very 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.750
 little things to talk about 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.660
 we should need 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.850
 then now we move on to the next 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 training that as I said I bring the 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.090
 variant that right now you are 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.010
 watching on your screens and you think 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.470
 that this is practically the same but 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.410
 if we go to the front 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.120
 since instead of the meteors they are 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.190
 band players so that so 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.200
 we can also play with this training 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.900
 but with players who are in the band 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.940
 because if it would not be a real bitch 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.860
 play that we could only play with the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.900
 meters with this training because for me 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.850
 is very very pretty in training is safe 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.220
 that would come out without current would be a 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.440
 of the most used because it would be amazing 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.239
 this training and then course 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.370
 also the mmd because if there are powers 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.580
 such as water millÃ¡n 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.000
 walcott players that add up or any 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.709
 Extreme extreme left and that good 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.270
 for example neymar could also play 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.490
 here 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.590
 of luxury and this is why I 've put the 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.410
 variant simply moves by this already 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.530
 all the rest of the training is 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.510
 exactly so kids I hope that 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.970
