00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
hi my name is cloudy Cindy arrow and I'm

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.839 
hi my name is cloudy Cindy arrow and I'm
going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.139> show<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.440> how<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.160> paint<00:00:14.639> with

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
going to show you how to paint with

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.320 
going to show you how to paint with
distortion<00:00:15.719> tools<00:00:15.990> over<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> photograph<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
distortion tools over a photograph the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
distortion tools over a photograph the
first<00:00:18.570> thing<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:20.070> this

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
first thing I would like to do with this

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
first thing I would like to do with this
image<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.750> lower<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.859> saturation<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
image is to lower the saturation to the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.419 
image is to lower the saturation to the
minimum<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> black<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> white

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
minimum so I have a black and white

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.470 
minimum so I have a black and white
image<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.439> also<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> lower<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.070> value<00:00:32.480> in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
image and also to lower the value in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
image and also to lower the value in
order<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.110> more<00:00:34.440> contrast<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.460> always

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
order to have more contrast I always

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.950 
order to have more contrast I always
always<00:00:36.960> keep<00:00:37.890> my<00:00:38.070> original<00:00:38.670> image<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.780> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
always keep my original image just in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
always keep my original image just in
case<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.250> case<00:00:41.550> i<00:00:41.910> would

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
case and for that in this case i would

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.380 
case and for that in this case i would
go<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.160> select<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.870> then<00:00:45.870> edit<00:00:46.550> copy<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.940> edit

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
go to select all then edit copy and edit

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.590 
go to select all then edit copy and edit
paste<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:50.100> means<00:00:50.340> i'm<00:00:50.579> having<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.030> copy<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.480> my

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
paste that means i'm having a copy of my

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.170 
paste that means i'm having a copy of my
original<00:00:52.260> canvas<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> case<00:00:53.879> I'm

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
original canvas and in this case I'm

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810 
original canvas and in this case I'm
doing<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> also<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
doing it also because i would like to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
doing it also because i would like to
large<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.360> canvas<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> bigger<00:00:58.559> size<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.640> my

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
large the canvas to a bigger size so my

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.280 
large the canvas to a bigger size so my
photograph<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.260> placed<00:01:01.590> inside<00:01:01.969> a<00:01:02.969> white<00:01:03.510> I'm

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
photograph is placed inside a white I'm

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.200 
photograph is placed inside a white I'm
frame

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.820 

now<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.110> fun<00:01:11.470> part<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.729> starting<00:01:13.150> tools<00:01:13.390> are

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
now the fun part the starting tools are

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.320 
now the fun part the starting tools are
tools<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:15.119> wouldn't<00:01:16.119> work<00:01:16.570> on<00:01:17.850> n<00:01:18.850> on<00:01:19.210> an

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
tools that wouldn't work on n on an

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.980 
tools that wouldn't work on n on an
empty<00:01:19.510> canvas<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.380> need<00:01:20.590> color<00:01:21.159> underneath

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
empty canvas you need color underneath

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.530 
empty canvas you need color underneath
the<00:01:22.990> tool<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.500> order<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.979> basically<00:01:24.369> pull<00:01:25.150> up

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
the tool in order to basically pull up

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.940 
the tool in order to basically pull up
and<00:01:26.020> down<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.950> color<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.610> create<00:01:28.390> image<00:01:28.950> over

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
and down the color and create image over

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.399 
and down the color and create image over
your<00:01:30.130> painting<00:01:30.520> with<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.540> they

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
your painting with that so they

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.560 
your painting with that so they

in painter light are in FX category and
this<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.190> one<00:01:39.369> distorted<00:01:40.240> tool<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:41.770> using

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
this is the one distorted tool by using

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.910 
this is the one distorted tool by using
this<00:01:42.970> tool<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.450> do<00:01:43.899> two<00:01:44.110> things<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.679> can

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
this tool I can do two things I can

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.950 
this tool I can do two things I can
distort<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.520> image<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:46.060> cities<00:01:46.390> or<00:01:46.660> I<00:01:46.690> can

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
distort the image a cities or I can

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.719 
distort the image a cities or I can
actually<00:01:47.500> add<00:01:47.679> colors<00:01:48.310> while<00:01:48.910> I'm<00:01:50.460> using<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
actually add colors while I'm using the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.550 
actually add colors while I'm using the
tool<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.330> this<00:01:52.450> case<00:01:52.750> what<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.289> would<00:01:53.530> like

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
tool so in this case what I would like

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.389 
tool so in this case what I would like
to<00:01:53.740> do<00:01:54.330> is<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.630> paint<00:01:55.869> some<00:01:56.110> lines<00:01:56.410> over<00:01:57.220> this

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
to do is to paint some lines over this

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
to do is to paint some lines over this
image<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.179> for<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:59.170> will<00:01:59.470> just<00:01:59.920> start

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
image and for that I will just start

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.889 
image and for that I will just start
eating<00:02:02.710> some<00:02:02.920> lines<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.610> in<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.600> case

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
eating some lines that in this case

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.990 
eating some lines that in this case
would<00:02:05.500> give<00:02:05.710> more<00:02:05.950> personality<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.820> this

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
would give more personality to this

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.979 
would give more personality to this
building<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:12.730> lower<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.269> size<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.780> my

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
building I can lower the size of my

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.729 
building I can lower the size of my
brush<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.030> would<00:02:16.739> increase

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
brush and in this way I would increase

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:25.260 
brush and in this way I would increase
in<00:02:18.810> perspective

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.809 

and<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:26.600> also<00:02:26.630> change<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.290> colors<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.550> for

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
and I can also change the colors so for

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.160 
and I can also change the colors so for
the<00:02:28.910> other<00:02:29.030> buildings<00:02:29.569> i'm<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.990> use

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
the other buildings i'm going to use

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.240 
the other buildings i'm going to use
different<00:02:30.709> tones<00:02:31.130> let's<00:02:31.550> say<00:02:31.819> we<00:02:32.569> can<00:02:32.750> go<00:02:32.930> to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
different tones let's say we can go to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.220 
different tones let's say we can go to
some<00:02:34.250> Purple's<00:02:34.819> here<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:37.959> give<00:02:38.959> more

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
some Purple's here to give more

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.570 
some Purple's here to give more
personality<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.780> building

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.280 

notice<00:02:45.580> how<00:02:45.819> important<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.020> your

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
notice how important it is for your

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.199 
notice how important it is for your
artistic<00:02:47.560> expression<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:49.060> use<00:02:49.180> a

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
artistic expression to use a

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.290 
artistic expression to use a
pressure-sensitive<00:02:49.890> drawing<00:02:50.890> tablet<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:55.120> in

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
pressure-sensitive drawing tablet and in

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240 
pressure-sensitive drawing tablet and in
order<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.630> have<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.319> give<00:02:56.470> more<00:02:56.680> volume<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
order to have to give more volume to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the best way for me to express that is

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.199 
the best way for me to express that is
to<00:03:23.050> paint<00:03:23.350> over<00:03:23.769> my<00:03:24.250> photographs<00:03:24.820> with

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
do in this case i will go to blenders

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.910 
do in this case i will go to blenders
and<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:09.489> order<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.850> have<00:04:10.440> glenda<00:04:11.440> images

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
and in order to have glenda images

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.340 
and in order to have glenda images
underneath<00:04:12.459> i<00:04:13.530> will<00:04:14.530> change<00:04:14.709> my<00:04:15.720> main<00:04:16.720> layer

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.509 

this<00:04:20.350> would<00:04:20.560> give<00:04:20.590> me<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.950> little<00:04:21.160> bit<00:04:21.310> more

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
this would give me a little bit more

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.350 
this would give me a little bit more
volume<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.440> another<00:04:23.440> kind<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:23.890> effect<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:25.240> i

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
volume and another kind of effect and i

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.510 
volume and another kind of effect and i
don't<00:04:25.600> really<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.169> effect<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.070> let's

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
don't really like this effect so let's

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.290 
don't really like this effect so let's
try<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.120> stab<00:04:28.479> their<00:04:28.840> real<00:04:29.110> blender<00:04:29.650> round

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
try and stab their real blender round

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.940 
try and stab their real blender round
and<00:04:31.300> i<00:04:31.390> find<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.200> live<00:04:32.410> show<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.830> gives

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and i find it is to live show that gives

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.720 
and i find it is to live show that gives
me<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.220> more<00:04:33.550> natural<00:04:34.030> look

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.300 

and<00:04:38.730> here<00:04:39.090> we<00:04:39.120> go<00:04:39.210> in<00:04:39.930> no<00:04:40.230> time<00:04:40.560> we<00:04:41.010> had<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.160> lot

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
and here we go in no time we had a lot

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.210 
and here we go in no time we had a lot
of<00:04:41.970> expression<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.290> image<00:04:43.650> that<00:04:44.040> was

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
of expression to this image that was

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.850 
of expression to this image that was
originally<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.030> black<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.480> white<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.620> we

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
originally in black and white and we

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.960 
originally in black and white and we
haven't<00:04:47.010> even<00:04:47.190> used<00:04:48.180> oils<00:04:48.870> or<00:04:49.170> inks<00:04:49.830> are<00:04:50.010> tools

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
haven't even used oils or inks are tools

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.400 
haven't even used oils or inks are tools
we<00:04:51.390> just<00:04:51.660> use<00:04:52.190> distortion<00:04:53.190> tools
