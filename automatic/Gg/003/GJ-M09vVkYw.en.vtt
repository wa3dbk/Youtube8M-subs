on each side and then the second bit

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.990 
on each side and then the second bit
which<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.869> top<00:01:10.110> bed<00:01:10.350> oh<00:01:10.560> yeah<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.820> that

which is the top bed oh yeah and on that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.170 
which is the top bed oh yeah and on that
bit<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.689> need<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:14.100> these<00:01:16.280> smooth<00:01:17.280> brick

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
bit you need to put these smooth brick

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
bit you need to put these smooth brick
thingies<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:19.320> quite<00:01:19.530> sure<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
thingies and look quite sure that I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.660 
thingies and look quite sure that I
could<00:01:20.220> um<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.659> square<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.369> three<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
could um in a square and three from the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.890 
could um in a square and three from the
back<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.170> middle<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.630> bit

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
back in the middle and then for this bit

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.270 
back in the middle and then for this bit
we<00:01:28.350> need<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.270> one<00:01:30.270> two<00:01:30.540> three<00:01:30.930> four<00:01:31.320> five<00:01:31.740> six

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
we need is a one two three four five six

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
we need is a one two three four five six

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
by four and then get a spinny thing and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.020 
by four and then get a spinny thing and
quite<00:01:36.540> sure<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.869> good<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.799> looks<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.549> like

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
quite sure it's good it looks a bit like

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.410 
quite sure it's good it looks a bit like
that<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:41.250> put<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> middle<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:44.509> then

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
that and put it in the middle and then

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.429 
that and put it in the middle and then
we<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:49.439> same<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> did<00:01:50.909> here

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
but instead of two layers flea layers

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.569 
but instead of two layers flea layers
and<00:01:58.340> then<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> fun<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> middle

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
and then but at the fun in the middle

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.410 
and then but at the fun in the middle
you<00:02:02.579> should<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.409> one<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.390> with<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
you should have one like this with a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.949 
you should have one like this with a
hole<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.079> middle<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.599> make<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
hole in the middle so you can make this

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.700 
hole in the middle so you can make this
when<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> kind

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
when you do for the kind

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.610 
when you do for the kind
just<00:02:13.550> get<00:02:13.840> five<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.050> these<00:02:15.230> bits<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:17.350> one<00:02:18.350> of

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
just get five of these bits and one of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.830 
just get five of these bits and one of
these<00:02:18.860> bits<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:20.300> make<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:22.220> end<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.660> at

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
these bits to make the end of it and at

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:36.040 
these bits to make the end of it and at
the<00:02:23.960> top<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:28.150> need<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:30.940> make<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:33.260> bit<00:02:35.050> you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the top you need to make this bit you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.260 
the top you need to make this bit you
need<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.650> two<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.220> these<00:02:37.430> things<00:02:37.850> where

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
need to get two of these things where

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.030 
need to get two of these things where
you<00:02:38.360> don't<00:02:38.510> really<00:02:38.660> need<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.710> did

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you don't really need it but I did

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
you don't really need it but I did
because<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.580> looks<00:02:40.790> cool<00:02:40.970> they<00:02:41.780> like<00:02:42.080> hang

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
because it looks cool they like hang

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.300 
because it looks cool they like hang
down<00:02:42.680> at<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.130> side<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.650> they<00:02:45.650> step<00:02:45.920> these<00:02:46.130> on

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
down at the side and they step these on

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.340 
down at the side and they step these on
the<00:02:46.400> side<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.540> don't<00:02:48.050> have<00:02:48.170> to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
the side of it but you don't have to

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.800 
the side of it but you don't have to
have<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.490> look<00:02:49.670> quick<00:02:49.910> good<00:02:50.120> and
