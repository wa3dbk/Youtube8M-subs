00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.120
 everyone 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.209
 how about friends how are you welcome to 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.750
 a new video today we have the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.760
 unboxing of samsung galaxy s 4 blue and 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.450
 well before I start I would like 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.950
 tell them can I say is a couple of 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.110
 specifications such as for example 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.540
 this in this case yes it can be done 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.670
 make calls not like in the galaxy 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.990
 camera that I have of android and everything that 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.550
 It looks like a phone but you can not 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.989
 make calls obviously with 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.829
 applications like skype and it is then yes 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.930
 but not telephone and it's also the 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.390
 sensor size of this phone is 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.520
 of the camera sensor is 1 match 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.289
 23 inches feeling also of 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.300
 sensors in the galaxy camera with the 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.519
 difference between those two that the galaxy 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.559
 camera we have a 21 by this phone 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.210
 has a 10 zoom by the without another way 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.149
 sensor the of the two banking difference is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.070
 that and ds4 because the name practically 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.320
 is more similar in that 4 min and its 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.170
 4.3 inch screens with resolution 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.540
 of 540 x 960 pixels is a screen 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.420
 super amoled a qhd screen with 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.500
 super amoled and good technology we are going to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.530
 start making the box and also 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.010
 as we see craters cardboard box 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.440
 recycling 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.240
 yes 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.700
 and on the back some of his 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.450
 specifications like your fishermen 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.090
 1.5 gigahertz like the same with 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.940
 16 GB expandable up to 64 GB 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 using microsd cards I tell them it 's 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.360
 more similar in this 4 mini 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.360
 and well we will start to open 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.600
 and the first thing that comes out is the phone and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.610
 its huge lens there the box bring as 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.670
 a mattress to hidalgo to protect it 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.710
 very well and electric step that the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.590
 phone or so with your lens and all your 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.630
 total weight is 208 grams is also not 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.050
 very exaggerated but yes more than any 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.940
 normal phone so to speak very well 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.130
 we get up from the eyelash as you see 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.950
 here it is and let's do it aside 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.030
 to also see what more containers 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.510
 here 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.700
 very well we raise the little eyelash 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.470
 and we found a pair is a kind of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.390
 certificate yes congratulations 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.069
 it's a samsung galaxy s 4 zoom now now 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.159
 they are experts like for a course or something 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.370
 well the truth I do not know and more guiding role of 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:38.010
 Quick start and guarantee policy for 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.370
 the back and we're going to see it 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.310
 You can look through it if I do not think it's better 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.280
 Remove if it is so you can catch a 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.590
 a little better 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.170
 and as we see highly today in the middle of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.550
 the two sad things are the modes of 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.300
 shot that brings the camera included 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.060
 as a night panorama what kind of things 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.800
 explains and they are cane like 20 20 shots 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.440
 the misunderstanding so let's put in your 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.100
 place this and we continue to see that it has 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.140
 the beautiful white usb micro usb cable 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.010
 white color and I leave an image to see 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.010
 if you can appreciate better 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.900
 very well we found some headphones with 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.370
 microphone and volume controller for 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.709
 microphone to subtract our calls 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.300
 and the volume counter to be able 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.420
 control our music without need 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.380
 of cannes the phone on the street or something 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.390
 well and we also found the gummies 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.850
 three pairs of gums to be specific 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.459
 to adapt it to different types of 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.870
 ears and I'll also leave you a couple of 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.769
 images so you can see can you 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.769
 appreciate a little better 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.760
 very well we continue and we find and 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.610
 we have spoken to you and we are going to 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.300
 remove the adapter that is connected to the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.030
 current 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.440
 let's connect your usb cable to be able 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.050
 have our phone also blank 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.360
 it's nice to color that game with the 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.650
 phone very well we do it aside 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.650
 also a small image 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.150
 very well we continue in continuation 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.430
 we have a cloth a bathroom that we have for 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.020
 to be able to clean our screen and the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.419
 camera lens I imagine very good 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.419
 detail as you can see is 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.130
 that we found the battery that in 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.960
 this case I'm not wrong are 3 thousand 30 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.660
 a thousand but he has an image to be 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.490
 can think a little better if three thousand 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.680
 330 thousand pesos will give us very good 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.360
 could no longer autonomy is nothing more 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.030
 box we do to one side 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.020
 and I show you some images so that 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.020
 see everything in the box 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.480
 very well let's take the phone 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.750
 and music such as plastic eyelash 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.840
 what was there 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.710
 ok very well and like other plastic 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.460
 and to protect the screen apparently 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.160
 as we see from that side 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.949
 obvious lens protrudes as we see 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.639
 have your speakers have the logo 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:29.419
 of his 10 so we see the flash 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.550
 this the other side we also have the 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.469
 round for microsd cards 64 gigas 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.620
 and to be able to place a strap like 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.949
 for a digital camera or any type 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.169
 of camera and there we have a rosquita 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.819
 to put a tripod is super father to 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.669
 to use more as our camera 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.830
 phone we put it in its place and 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.529
 we also find her face knows her 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.419
 phone is worth the micro usb and 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.189
 uncover and in there for the battery and 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.990
 the simple micro leave an image for 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:00.630
 to appreciate better as it looks 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.530
 that blue gets up and in there at the 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.620
 drums 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.210
 let's try to lift it up more 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.600
 well it is bounced and it is and there our 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.610
 drums 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.710
 we close it 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.320
 and there are 3 our 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.780
 micros and close them very well and we 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.480
 the camera trigger the controller 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.650
 of the volume plus or minus and the button 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.180
 on and off 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.720
 in the upper part we find the 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.880
 3.5 jack for headphones and that little dot 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.410
 on the side is an infrared to use it with 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.229
 remote control control our 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.880
