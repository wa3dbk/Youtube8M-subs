the<00:01:37.190> 7<00:01:37.460> kg<00:01:37.789> spring<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:39.229> I'm<00:01:39.289> going<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.470> go<00:01:39.530> ahead

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
the 7 kg spring so I'm going to go ahead

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.209 
the 7 kg spring so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:39.860> move<00:01:39.950> these<00:01:40.160> out<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.430> way

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:54.590 

and<00:01:45.340> we'll<00:01:46.030> take<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.270> look<00:01:46.539> at<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:46.960> internals

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.700 

and<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.840> trigger

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
and the trigger

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.050 
and the trigger
okay<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.880> we<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:01.729> elite<00:02:02.729> style

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
okay so here we have a elite style

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.130 
okay so here we have a elite style
breach<00:02:06.229> an<00:02:07.229> elite<00:02:07.710> style<00:02:08.039> plunger<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.660> our

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
breach an elite style plunger and our

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.750 
breach an elite style plunger and our
direct<00:02:11.540> plunger<00:02:12.540> plunger<00:02:13.140> -<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:14.190> what<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
direct plunger plunger - so what this

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.780 
direct plunger plunger - so what this
kit<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> retrofit<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.590> converts<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
kit is is a retrofit that converts the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.600 
kit is is a retrofit that converts the
reverse<00:02:18.300> plunger<00:02:18.780> along<00:02:19.050> strike<00:02:19.349> cs6<00:02:19.980> into<00:02:20.580> a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
reverse plunger along strike cs6 into a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.970 
reverse plunger along strike cs6 into a
direct<00:02:21.120> plunger<00:02:21.569> elite<00:02:21.959> style<00:02:22.260> blaster<00:02:22.709> and

direct plunger elite style blaster and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.120 
direct plunger elite style blaster and
to<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.700> we've<00:02:23.940> had<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.269> change<00:02:25.130> make

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
to do that we've had to change make

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.820 
to do that we've had to change make
significant<00:02:26.760> changes<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.349> trigger<00:02:28.590> catch

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
significant changes to the trigger catch

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.030 
significant changes to the trigger catch
of<00:02:29.160> reach<00:02:29.370> plunger<00:02:30.299> body<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.470> cap<00:02:31.739> and

plunger the bolt sled is similar to that

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.020 
plunger the bolt sled is similar to that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.120 
reinforced like our previous long strike
bolt<00:02:39.060> slit<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.989> made<00:02:40.140> out<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.290> impact

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
bolt slit and is made out of impact

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.569 
bolt slit and is made out of impact
resistant<00:02:41.670> black<00:02:42.120> polycarbonate<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.489> I'm

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
resistant black polycarbonate so I'm

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.800 
resistant black polycarbonate so I'm
going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> move<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.000> bolt<00:02:45.150> slide<00:02:45.329> aside<00:02:45.599> for

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
going to move the bolt slide aside for

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.300 
going to move the bolt slide aside for
now<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.170> we're<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.799> take<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> closer

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
now and we're going to take a closer

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.660 
now and we're going to take a closer
look<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.170> plunger<00:02:49.380> system

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
look at the plunger system

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.059 
look at the plunger system
so<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.930> make<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.319> direct<00:02:53.650> plunger

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
so to make this direct plunger

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.610 
so to make this direct plunger
we<00:02:57.069> had<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.310> work<00:02:57.489> within<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.879> constraints<00:02:58.030> of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
we had to work within the constraints of

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.320 
we had to work within the constraints of
the<00:02:59.620> existing<00:03:00.159> long<00:03:00.370> striped<00:03:00.670> shell<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.150> made

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the existing long striped shell we made

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.180 
the existing long striped shell we made
no<00:03:01.540> changes<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.290> shell<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.040> this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
no changes to the shell to do this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.750 
no changes to the shell to do this
conversion<00:03:03.599> so<00:03:04.599> to<00:03:04.659> do<00:03:05.019> that<00:03:05.340> we've<00:03:06.340> had<00:03:06.580> we

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
conversion so to do that we've had we

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.809 
conversion so to do that we've had we
have<00:03:06.940> these<00:03:07.180> on<00:03:08.099> braces<00:03:09.099> on<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.430> side<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
have these on braces on the side of the

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.930 
have these on braces on the side of the
plunger<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.510> grip<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:12.280> shell<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.810> one<00:03:13.810> two

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
plunger that grip the shell and one two

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.670 
plunger that grip the shell and one two
three<00:03:15.940> four<00:03:16.150> five<00:03:16.450> places<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.379> when<00:03:17.560> that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
three four five places so when that

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.890 
three four five places so when that
plunger<00:03:18.160> impacts<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:19.150> distributes<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
plunger impacts it distributes the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.530 
plunger impacts it distributes the
impact<00:03:20.349> force<00:03:20.879> throughout<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:22.120> inside<00:03:22.420> of

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
impact force throughout the inside of

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.440 
impact force throughout the inside of
the<00:03:22.599> shell<00:03:22.980> now<00:03:23.980> because<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:24.970> static

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the shell now because this is a static

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.600 
the shell now because this is a static
plunger<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:25.989> doesn't<00:03:26.590> move<00:03:26.799> back<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.340> forth

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
plunger and doesn't move back and forth

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.059 
plunger and doesn't move back and forth
like<00:03:27.819> with<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> other<00:03:28.269> elite<00:03:29.049> blasters<00:03:29.560> we've

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
like with the other elite blasters we've

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.180 
like with the other elite blasters we've
tapered<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.180> tip<00:03:31.989> right<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.560> end<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:33.099> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
tapered the tip right the end of the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.240 
tapered the tip right the end of the
plunger<00:03:33.489> right<00:03:33.609> here<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:34.420> slow<00:03:34.780> down<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
plunger right here to slow down the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.430 
plunger right here to slow down the
plunger<00:03:36.849> during<00:03:37.269> firing

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
plunger during firing

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.590 
plunger during firing
so<00:03:40.070> it<00:03:40.190> doesn't<00:03:40.490> impart<00:03:40.730> as<00:03:40.970> much<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.570> shock

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
so it doesn't impart as much of a shock

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.270 
so it doesn't impart as much of a shock
to<00:03:42.140> your<00:03:42.680> blaster<00:03:43.130> during<00:03:43.610> Operation<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:45.280> bat

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
accommodate the plunger and the narrower

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.390 
accommodate the plunger and the narrower
spring

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.110 

the<00:04:01.030> trigger<00:04:01.269> catch<00:04:01.480> has<00:04:01.900> had<00:04:02.590> its<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.849> area

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
the trigger catch has had its the area

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
with that interfaces with the plunger

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.710 
with that interfaces with the plunger
dropped<00:04:05.860> down<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.640> other<00:04:06.879> elite<00:04:07.269> blasters

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
dropped down like other elite blasters

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.140 
dropped down like other elite blasters
so<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.650> lock<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.940> elite<00:04:10.330> plunger<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
your dart and the mouth has been widened

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.170 
your dart and the mouth has been widened
a<00:04:28.630> little<00:04:28.870> bit<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.710> assist<00:04:30.100> with<00:04:30.280> loading<00:04:30.639> we

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
a little bit to assist with loading we

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.080 
a little bit to assist with loading we
also<00:04:31.389> moved<00:04:31.960> back<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.800> area<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.610> begins

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
also moved back the area that begins

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.909 
also moved back the area that begins
sealing<00:04:34.570> against<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> dart<00:04:35.199> to<00:04:35.740> better

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
sealing against the dart to better

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.570 
sealing against the dart to better

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
accommodate elite darts the long strike

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.409 
accommodate elite darts the long strike
does<00:04:39.820> not<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.510> elite<00:04:40.780> dart<00:04:41.320> tooth<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.419> it

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
does not have the elite dart tooth so it

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.110 
does not have the elite dart tooth so it
can<00:04:43.720> bend<00:04:44.199> elite<00:04:44.620> darts<00:04:44.860> when<00:04:45.370> loading<00:04:45.789> so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
can bend elite darts when loading so

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.920 
can bend elite darts when loading so
with<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.900> massacre<00:04:47.650> kit<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.130> even<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.580> stock

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.570 
with the massacre kit and even the stock
breech<00:04:49.930> so<00:04:50.260> what<00:04:50.380> we<00:04:50.500> did<00:04:50.650> is<00:04:50.949> we<00:04:51.130> tried<00:04:51.370> to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
breech so what we did is we tried to

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.310 
breech so what we did is we tried to
make<00:04:51.729> this<00:04:51.880> as<00:04:52.060> accommodating<00:04:52.570> as<00:04:52.750> possible

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
make this as accommodating as possible

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.900 
make this as accommodating as possible
