00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello my dear scientists in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.379
 power as they want to see the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 experiments with liquid nitrogen 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.000
 also that is 200 degrees low of 2 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.200
 they would not notice camera lights and discover 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.330
 much more action 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.220
 very well let's see now the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.580
 properties of this elements that 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.160
 we have here that liquid nitrogen the 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.489
 nitrogen you knew is part of the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.280
 air to the air is 80% nitrogen and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.520
 20% oxygen and nitrogen at very low 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.080
 temperature becomes liquid here this 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.410
 liquid has 200 degrees below zero is 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.790
 very very cold what we are going to do is see 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.610
 His properties 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.560
 here we have some balloons that are going to 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.430
 help see how nitrogen works 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.920
 liquid 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.410
 we also have this plastic bottle 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.579
 and what we are going to do is place the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.610
 nitrogen inside we see in this way 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.420
 as liquid nitrogen tends to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.810
 boil if we put our hand under this 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.430
 causes nitrogen rise slightly its 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.399
 temperature and we see it like faster 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 so take it up so we're going 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.240
 to do is place one 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.970
 we are going to place it here on top of the peak 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.970
 from the bottle and he starts to inflate 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.750
 if we place our hand underneath this 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 causes nitrogen to expel more and more 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 Quick 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.979
 very well we are going to tie a knot 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.310
 there was a globe made 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.350
 well let's see now how the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.710
 inter a gene or liquid when we throw it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.850
 about the goal that is hot to see 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.450
 let's look at you 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.869
 we are going to contribute drop by drop and see 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.299
 As the drops slip this is the same 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.840
 effect that works with a part in 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.690
 hot and water drops slide 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.860
 because a small movie of 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.860
 gas between the drop and the fruit floor 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.500
 well very well I never had they have the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.500
 yellow
