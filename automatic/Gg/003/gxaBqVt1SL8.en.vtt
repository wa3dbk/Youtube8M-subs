00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.620
 like this one we are not going to but this one voice 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 as one our borders 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.000
 this I feel that what they get paid 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.680
 in the spark is a weapon that was introduced 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.020
 in the much against explained which is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 questionable where he trained this is 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.310
 one of the most dynamic that I play 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.260
 by fact of pigs by one you have two 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180
 different fashions that are the sword that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 when you walk you have the evolution of a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.809
 big sword and platja that if you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.390
 they get with a hammer 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.100
 both have modes that have the same 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 damage but the difference lies in the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.989
 rate movements and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 combos of these good in the ax mode 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.130
 what happens is that our movement is 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.630
 much faster appears nothing more 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.239
 well to what is the longsword or the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.770
 hammer has standard movements and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.050
 has several great power like what 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.600
 which is a hook the power of the ax 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 is limited and does not have any kind of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.190
 bonus unless you use a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.140
 element and the attacks are medium and 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.080
 long distance this means that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 you have some advantage of being a little 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.790
 further against the monster and then 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 you do not have to get so close 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 to be able to attack it with the case that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 it would be the sword 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 in back mode because our 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.750
 movements are much slower and the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.490
 most of the time we should be rolling 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.159
 to be able to hit the monster since it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.860
 they need a lot to attack in the mode 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.420
 sword is more accurate than that of the h 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 also we have a technique 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 call download which when starting the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 I start a load of the element and then 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 produces a strong explosion which 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.700
 it hurts us in fact if 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 we are close to the monster and we perform 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.799
 what is the discharge all while 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.050
 is loading is generating this damage to 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.660
 mouse which causes that therefore 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 eliminated easier and apart is possible 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.270
 that we give him if he has something of element or 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.580
 been some problems may 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.909
 let's also take the monster 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.250
 let's give it what we have, paralyze it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.289
 good plus advantages of swords or 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.700
 births and the unique movement to 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.680
 which allows us to roll and attack 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.680
 directly this is useful 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.690
 since you have to be very close 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.030
 of ours that if it allows us 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.280
 attack directly even after 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.069
 start unleashing a combo in the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.260
 serial or special which helps us 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.720
 to improve the attack of our weapon and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.549
 Well, there are different types of special 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.860
 in which to say a little more than 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.409
 they later great precision in those 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.349
 hits this great power in the attack 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.110
 they are two weapons in one which is done 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.769
 a very adaptable and very dynamic weapon in 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.470
 the missions or the combos even has 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.620
 combos that are infinite can be 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.810
 exchange weapons modes between 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.000
 the combos which it allows us to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.609
 the combos are very long and how I'm going to 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.890
 comment others even the limiting nothing 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.019
 more of our character is this the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.540
 made to nail networks walks if you have 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.319
 a sumo of power or something that allows you 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.060
 this one that walks them does not decay 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.870
 there are some combos that can be said 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.870
 that are 1500 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.200
 well the disadvantages of the h sword are 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.780
 the following the sharpening of the weapon is 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 generally bad what you have to 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.640
 load many pedrÃ³s to be able to sharpen 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.010
 since all the attacks with the boat 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.400
 tend to bounce when you have the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.989
 maximum edge this can cause us 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.910
 can attack the monsters even us 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.970
 can faint in the sharpening process 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.810
 the controls are confusing at times 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.209
 you get confused when you want to take 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.000
 the sword has a load bar what 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.510
 which then to the class by pressing on 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.730
 our king and this one put the charge for 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.040
 can activate the mode again and another 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.110
 times are valuable minutes and which 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.750
 causes us to attack the knots 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.269
 and this also the sword mode is 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.160
 have to recharge the infinities this 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.800
 has is a small bar in which 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.230
 it tells us that you already have to recharge it 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.420
 It does not have a blockade which causes 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.700
 that we have to be dodging 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.010
 constantly and you can talk more in 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.900
 general terms is not very fast then 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.730
 since it has a large size indeed 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.760
 because the module is much slower but 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.590
 in ax mode so it was with me 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.000
 then with the disadvantages that they have 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.650
 not because this one 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.090
 every weapon has something special like 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.160
 in the world prove to count for 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.740
 differentiate it totally or to make them 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.630
 totally unique in this case we have 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.280
 special connections 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.050
 these are unique additions to the axes 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.870
 sword which allow us to improve 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.400
 the attack or add attributes to the tree 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.380
 then specials are not complicated 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 to use since you only have to change to 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.070
 sword mode and with that it will be more than 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.890
 enough for you to ask for specials 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.080
 there are four specials which are 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.270
 what if in the following the element 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.270
 in this kind of specials with very common 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.350
 and added 25% elemental damage to 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.170
 long 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.800
 the power special this is also 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:13.790
 common and adds 25% physical damage to the 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:17.570
 asthma the special dragon mode this guy 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.150
 special is very rare and adds the 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.220
 dragon element to alarm and also has 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.030
 what is the paralysis in which then 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.080
 this post is also something strange and 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.379
 Add 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.379
 is the status of alarm paralysis 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.030
 Well, these are all aspects 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.710
 basics that the best you should know 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.080
 when they start using what milk says 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.110
 sword in the description of the video I'm going to 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.790
 leave some combos so that they can 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.950
 be using since issues is very 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.660
 complicated to put them in the video for not 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.270
 make it too long very tedious 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.880
 I hope you liked any 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.650
 doubt only compose in the comments 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.810
 do not forget to give the one above 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.430
 subscribe if you liked it and share it 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.750
 in case you have a friend who 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.330
 have to buy love with the most 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.030
 fantastic this good then with that 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.110
 we finished our video so so 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.110
 see you later
