so<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.650> track<00:00:42.890> thing<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.190> not<00:00:43.400> necessarily<00:00:44.000> a

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
so the track thing is not necessarily a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.479 
so the track thing is not necessarily a
logical<00:00:44.720> need<00:00:44.989> for<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.350> brand<00:00:45.590> but<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
logical need for the brand but the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.280 
logical need for the brand but the
chassis<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:47.420> good<00:00:47.660> i<00:00:47.870> mean<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.260> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
own oil i used to build engines quite a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.860 
own oil i used to build engines quite a
bit<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:23.250> i<00:02:23.580> tried<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> track<00:02:24.420> these<00:02:24.570> whenever

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
invites me to test days all the time so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.620 
invites me to test days all the time so
I<00:02:31.050> could<00:02:31.170> help<00:02:31.290> them<00:02:31.500> evaluate<00:02:31.709> cars<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.600> get<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
I could help them evaluate cars so get a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.390 
I could help them evaluate cars so get a
lot<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.810> seat<00:02:34.050> time<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.470> helps<00:02:34.650> me<00:02:34.800> give

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
lot of seat time and it helps me give

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.880 
lot of seat time and it helps me give
better<00:02:35.580> inputs

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.470 

this<00:02:43.890> car<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.220> very<00:02:44.340> synthesized<00:02:44.910> now<00:02:45.180> so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
this car is very synthesized now so

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.449 
this car is very synthesized now so
we've<00:02:45.630> we've<00:02:45.990> enjoyed<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.280> learning

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
we've we've enjoyed kind of learning

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.710 
we've we've enjoyed kind of learning
everybody's<00:02:48.030> getting<00:02:48.240> better<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.569> what<00:02:48.690> they

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
everybody's getting better at what they

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.010 
everybody's getting better at what they
do<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.880> shows<00:02:51.090> i<00:02:51.240> mean<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.600> eight-speed

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
do and it shows i mean the eight-speed

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.610 
do and it shows i mean the eight-speed
is<00:02:52.310> completely<00:02:53.310> transformed<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.060> vehicle

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
is completely transformed this vehicle

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.540 
is completely transformed this vehicle
the<00:02:55.620> other<00:02:55.770> car<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:55.950> great<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.340> mean<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
the other car was great I mean the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.790 
the other car was great I mean the
2013's<00:02:57.360> one<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.630> 12<00:02:57.840> versions<00:02:58.170> are<00:02:58.260> fantastic

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
2013's one in 12 versions are fantastic

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.470 
2013's one in 12 versions are fantastic
cars<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.520> there's<00:02:59.670> just<00:02:59.730> takes<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
cars but there's just takes it to a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.300 
cars but there's just takes it to a
different<00:03:00.540> level

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
different level

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.130 
different level
the<00:03:02.640> paddle<00:03:03.000> shift<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.450> weights<00:03:03.630> integrate

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the paddle shift the weights integrate

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.449 
the paddle shift the weights integrate
is<00:03:04.260> also<00:03:04.530> cool<00:03:04.709> we're<00:03:04.890> using<00:03:05.010> all<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
is also cool we're using all the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.580 
is also cool we're using all the
controllers<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.150> car<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:07.170> really<00:03:07.440> give

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
controllers in the car to really give

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.559 
controllers in the car to really give
the<00:03:07.709> car<00:03:07.890> kind<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.580> multiple<00:03:08.970> personalities

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
the car kind of multiple personalities

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.839 
the car kind of multiple personalities
we<00:03:09.690> select<00:03:10.380> not<00:03:11.010> only<00:03:11.190> changes<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.610> torque

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
we select not only changes the torque

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.780 
we select not only changes the torque
split<00:03:12.060> changes<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.810> PSP<00:03:13.530> calibration<00:03:14.190> so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
split changes the PSP calibration so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.010 
split changes the PSP calibration so
there's<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.030> lot<00:03:15.120> more<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.599> do<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.870> all

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
there's a lot more we can do with all

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.170 
there's a lot more we can do with all
the<00:03:16.200> technology<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.950> board<00:03:17.190> while<00:03:17.819> never
