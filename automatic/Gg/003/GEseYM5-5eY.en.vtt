00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.110
 the staff here is the pole I'll el 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.240
 show you how it works out 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:21.290
 flying both jets of attack when 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.270
 already liked publishing a game saying that 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.250
 only win is who is behind in the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.349
 chase time who knows how to take 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.480
 Clear sexual form , right? 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.340
 there is also a very small chance and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.920
 you win the fight are ahead in the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.350
 perfection but left explained the moment 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.470
 as a video about technique will move forward 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.240
 the team but first let's start 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.980
 the consultants, right? 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.340
 there in the settings you will choose the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.360
 option the following the tones of the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.650
 vehicle the tone of the helicopter and gates 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.130
 of the jet 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.230
 so looking only pilot 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.370
 It will be much easier for 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 tips I'll give you now 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.439
 good basic concept that you can achieve 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.380
 If you do well in an airborne 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.359
 basically you need to stay in the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.119
 position is that you can 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.859
 to set your album that way to 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 you reach advantage positions you 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.399
 need to make the turns more closed 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.709
 possible, right? 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.030
 the most common way you do the curves 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.030
 in this game 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.520
 it's two it's all normal and it's you 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.079
 accelerating on the normal mountain range farm 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.959
 and the closed curve is you make in the tub 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.729
 using a gold brake like this is the brake 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.729
 to the jet deceleration 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.119
 well the place too now it 's because I 'm 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.090
 seeing here to explain to you that it is 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.000
 possible to make a more closed curve of the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.829
 that the closed curve ie you go 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.420
 stand out much more at the time of 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.420
 Persecution against opponents 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.869
 It's very simple when you go. 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.370
 make the curve is the pulse be closed to 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.769
 that they may say you have to use 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.200
 the following will do with the normal goes 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.170
 brake and when you have braking you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.840
 goes at the same time left lever 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.150
 or you will leave me to bring the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.829
 airplane in making a super closed 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 look how the difference between 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.400
 dark 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.520
 Of course you can find 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.160
 with another player who already knows this 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 technique created in there time of persecution 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.120
 so I'll give you another important tip 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.620
 so that you can still 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.630
 stand out in that state 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.360
 when the guy sees you there and chasing you 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.250
 doing with the closed with you and such 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.470
 You will make your curve closed but 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.110
 Are you going to take a dip and this direction? 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.850
 curve as if it were a half lugo 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.040
 this way you will achieve 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.560
 position is that the position of the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.650
 advantage the persecution with much more 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.650
 facility 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.450
 Now I'll speak at ease cnec em 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.420
 connection to the airplane 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.980
 in this case the machine gun shots 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.739
 of the plane almost has no strokes band 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.870
 nelson already fallen from there 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.790
 so if you take it directly 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.849
 on a target the agenda for myself and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.230
 You improved, you only become smart when 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.750
 you shoot the machine gun in a 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.129
 persecution in Cuba because then yes you 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.680
 will need to compensate in the 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.200
 I can sit with me but one 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.230
 style and will arrive late in the album 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.230
 previous 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.599
 another recommendation is very important 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.269
 It's also when you fly by the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.540
 base island can happen the machine gun 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.829
 anti-aircraft start shooting 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.500
 millions of titles in you 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.150
 If this happens, do not panic, it's you. 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.940
 look back from the center of the map 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.340
 accelerating clear and giving some 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.440
 bolts so the conca kick 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.170
 The more physical to hit you can 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.220
 get there in the center of the map you 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.220
 will not be shot 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.490
 Already another moment when you go 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.070
 battle against helicopters seeks 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.099
 always attack from top to bottom never 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.539
 attack from the front and neither attack from below 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.150
 up 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.940
 this way you will be shot with 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.039
 very easy and water serving from above 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.199
 down does not like us hit 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.240
 only would be to stay ahead of the helicopter 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.729
 to get right but then when you 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.810
 spout made of back in sucked back 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.090
 toward the ground 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.490
 or it will be very confusing the guy 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.650
 will not opt for this dangerous option only 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.380
 to help hit is always good 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.180
 remember that when you have the sights 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.919
 of missiles and a helicopter 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.780
 You have to get away the fastest. 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.220
 possible day is obvious already have 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.280
 infinitely faster than the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.380
 the helicopter and you walked away from him and 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.139
 when exercising the power of mir is the 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.250
 oxygen from the helicopter's scope will 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.250
 losing 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.960
 if still the guy got shot 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.000
 missiles against you 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.449
 you just drop the players or 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.960
 medium detergents 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.849
 wonder and keeps my speed and straight 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.689
 until you recovered if you left the 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.620
 reach him and you will escape from taking 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.620
 a bug in the middle of the mouse 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.729
 combination of all these tips and 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.009
 right course is the practice that will leave 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:45.319
 practically invincible in the 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:48.569
 she hopes I'll help you see this 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.759
 Knowledge I passed and do not forget 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.710
 of that joinha in the video and if possible 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:56.279
 share to give me strength 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.900
 beautiful beauty back and I hope you 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.900
 A big hug and even more.
