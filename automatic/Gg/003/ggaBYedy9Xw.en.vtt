Hawthorne Farms I'm basically making us

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.799 
Hawthorne Farms I'm basically making us
a<00:00:11.530> little<00:00:11.650> more<00:00:11.830> efficient<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.570> way<00:00:13.660> we

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
a little more efficient the way we

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.720 
a little more efficient the way we
analyze<00:00:14.019> the<00:00:14.469> data<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.980> way<00:00:15.099> we<00:00:15.250> handle<00:00:15.639> the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
analyze the data the way we handle the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.840 
analyze the data the way we handle the
data<00:00:16.290> how<00:00:17.290> much<00:00:17.529> product<00:00:18.130> that<00:00:18.610> we<00:00:18.700> get

process as streamlined as I can in the
back<00:00:31.420> of<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.929> lab<00:00:32.140> there's<00:00:32.800> an<00:00:32.890> acoustics

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
back of the lab there's an acoustics

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.140 
back of the lab there's an acoustics
chamber<00:00:34.059> where<00:00:34.510> we<00:00:34.780> do<00:00:34.960> some<00:00:35.739> very<00:00:36.339> fine

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
chamber where we do some very fine

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.539 
chamber where we do some very fine
measurement<00:00:37.750> of<00:00:37.900> noise<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.739> frequencies<00:00:39.339> of

large we'll call them irradiated

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.149 
large we'll call them irradiated
chambers<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:45.790> those<00:00:45.909> can<00:00:46.150> be<00:00:46.180> used<00:00:46.269> for<00:00:46.750> both

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
chambers and those can be used for both

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
whatever rotates on a turntable so the

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.619 
whatever rotates on a turntable so the
tennis<00:00:59.860> stays<00:01:00.100> fixed<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:00.699> it's<00:01:00.820> getting<00:01:01.210> all

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
tennis stays fixed and it's getting all

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.350 
tennis stays fixed and it's getting all
the<00:01:02.229> directions<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.400> that<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.939> product

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
the directions that the that the product

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.230 
the directions that the that the product
emits<00:01:04.720> they<00:01:05.680> also<00:01:05.860> use<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.790> same<00:01:07.000> room<00:01:07.210> for

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
emits they also use the same room for

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.120 
emits they also use the same room for
for<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:07.990> immunity<00:01:08.530> test<00:01:08.740> where<00:01:09.010> you're

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
for this immunity test where you're

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.790 
for this immunity test where you're
bombarding<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:09.820> product<00:01:10.180> as<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.390> rotates

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
bombarding the product as it rotates

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.430 
bombarding the product as it rotates
then<00:01:11.800> we<00:01:11.920> have<00:01:12.070> equipment<00:01:12.430> for<00:01:13.000> power<00:01:13.960> line

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
then we have equipment for power line

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.260 
then we have equipment for power line
noise<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.410> our<00:01:17.410> product<00:01:17.980> roulette<00:01:18.280> reacts<00:01:19.030> to

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
noise and our product roulette reacts to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.470 
noise and our product roulette reacts to
that<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.810> have<00:01:20.250> equipment<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:21.550> ESD<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.360> know

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
that we have equipment for ESD you know

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.090 
that we have equipment for ESD you know
you<00:01:22.540> walk<00:01:22.870> across<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.380> room<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.800> touch

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
you walk across the room and you touch

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.460 
you walk across the room and you touch
something<00:01:25.090> after<00:01:25.510> being<00:01:25.720> on<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.870> carpet<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
something after being on the carpet you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.170 
something after being on the carpet you
know<00:01:26.620> is<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.100> fry<00:01:27.280> my<00:01:27.310> computer<00:01:28.030> as

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
know is that going to fry my computer as

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.820 
know is that going to fry my computer as
we're<00:01:28.720> working<00:01:28.840> through<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.260> lab<00:01:29.440> then<00:01:29.740> you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
we're working through the lab then you

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.130 
we're working through the lab then you
get<00:01:29.980> into<00:01:30.100> our<00:01:30.310> chambers<00:01:30.850> or<00:01:31.480> attesting<00:01:32.110> for

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
get into our chambers or attesting for

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.530 
get into our chambers or attesting for
temperature<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.250> humidity<00:01:33.880> as<00:01:34.090> well<00:01:34.360> as

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
temperature and humidity as well as

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.290 
temperature and humidity as well as
fatigue<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.770> will<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.610> survive<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.210> this

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
fatigue so will it survive in this

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.780 
fatigue so will it survive in this
environment<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:38.350> what<00:01:38.620> happens<00:01:39.040> when<00:01:39.400> you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
environment what what happens when you

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.720 
environment what what happens when you
know<00:01:39.909> it's<00:01:40.110> 80%<00:01:41.110> humidity<00:01:41.230> and<00:01:41.860> 100<00:01:42.370> degrees

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
know it's 80% humidity and 100 degrees

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.880 
know it's 80% humidity and 100 degrees
what's<00:01:43.300> going<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.570> happen<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.290> sort<00:01:44.650> of<00:01:44.680> all

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
what's going to happen in sort of all

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.640 
what's going to happen in sort of all
these<00:01:45.070> sort<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.460> environmental<00:01:46.650> situations

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
these sort of environmental situations

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.649 
these sort of environmental situations
so<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:47.979> have<00:01:48.190> quite<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.580> cross-section<00:01:49.570> of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
so we have quite a cross-section of

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.000 
so we have quite a cross-section of
equipment<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.170> then<00:01:50.290> as<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.620> said<00:01:50.830> when<00:01:50.979> we

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
equipment and then as you said when we

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.820 
equipment and then as you said when we
get<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.460> lab<00:01:51.729> we<00:01:52.450> have<00:01:52.690> vibration<00:01:53.380> tables

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
get to this lab we have vibration tables

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.640 
get to this lab we have vibration tables
that<00:01:54.159> will<00:01:54.310> shake<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.850> various<00:01:55.180> axes<00:01:55.690> we<00:01:56.500> have

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
that will shake in various axes we have

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.080 
that will shake in various axes we have
three<00:01:57.280> actual<00:01:57.670> drop<00:01:58.300> tables<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:59.290> have<00:02:00.090> drops

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
three actual drop tables we have drops

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.250 
three actual drop tables we have drops
large<00:02:01.870> tables<00:02:02.320> for<00:02:02.760> dropping<00:02:03.760> systems<00:02:04.330> and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
large tables for dropping systems and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.020 
large tables for dropping systems and
then<00:02:05.440> we<00:02:05.560> actually<00:02:05.740> even<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.850> back
