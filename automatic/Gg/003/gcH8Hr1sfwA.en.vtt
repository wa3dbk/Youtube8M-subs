stuff<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.209> direct<00:04:11.510> see<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.840> cards<00:04:12.260> are<00:04:12.500> so

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
stuff the direct see you cards are so

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:13.990 
stuff the direct see you cards are so
unique<00:04:13.040> in<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.280> way<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.400> they're<00:04:13.640> designed

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
unique in the way that they're designed

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.910 
unique in the way that they're designed
they're<00:04:14.450> very<00:04:14.720> big<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.290> must<00:04:15.620> point<00:04:15.739> out

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
they're very big and I must point out

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.229 
they're very big and I must point out
right<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:16.310> though<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.669> these<00:04:16.820> cards<00:04:17.120> will

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
right now though that these cards will

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.030 
right now though that these cards will
probably<00:04:17.600> only<00:04:17.780> work<00:04:18.230> in<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.530> zoo<00:04:18.709> some<00:04:18.919> other

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
probably only work in a zoo some other

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.610 
probably only work in a zoo some other
boards<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:20.060> know<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.959> we<00:04:21.019> were<00:04:21.109> testing<00:04:21.530> him

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
boards I know that we were testing him

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.050 
boards I know that we were testing him
we<00:04:21.829> found<00:04:22.010> out<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.520> few<00:04:22.730> of<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:22.850> boards

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
we found out that a few of the boards

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.400 
we found out that a few of the boards
that<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.240> had<00:04:23.389> we<00:04:23.540> could<00:04:23.570> not<00:04:23.840> use<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.050> card

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
that we had we could not use the card

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.810 
that we had we could not use the card
him<00:04:24.530> because<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.830> actually<00:04:24.980> bump<00:04:25.370> up<00:04:25.490> against

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
him because it actually bump up against

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.070 
him because it actually bump up against
it<00:04:25.940> I'll<00:04:26.090> go<00:04:26.300> over<00:04:26.389> that<00:04:26.510> more<00:04:26.570> in<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.870> full
