a Resident Evil game before my first one

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
a Resident Evil game before my first one

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
was resonable for so I'm probably going

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
was resonable for so I'm probably going
to<00:01:15.630> try<00:01:15.869> somehow<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> play<00:01:16.650> Resident<00:01:17.280> Evil<00:01:17.430> 1

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

to try somehow to play Resident Evil 1
33<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.240> time<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:19.049> those<00:01:19.259> games<00:01:19.560> are

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
33 some time because those games are

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.060 
33 some time because those games are
interesting<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.890> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
interesting so that's the one so that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980 
interesting so that's the one so that's
the<00:01:23.220> first<00:01:23.369> game<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.299> second<00:01:24.810> game

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the first game I want to get second game

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
the first game I want to get second game
is<00:01:25.200> prototype<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.250> game<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.610> announced

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

is prototype this game was announced
about<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.990> sure<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.290> 23<00:01:29.040> years<00:01:29.250> ago<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
about pretty sure about 23 years ago it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.929 
about pretty sure about 23 years ago it
probably<00:01:30.960> run<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> time<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:32.280> yeah<00:01:32.909> i

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that looks like a cool game in my

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.520 
that looks like a cool game in my

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530 
opinion though I want to learn more
about<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.909> had<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.299> background

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
about it I just had with my background

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.319 
about it I just had with my background
right<00:01:57.899> now<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.439> had<00:01:58.530> fallen<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
right now because I had fallen in but I

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
right now because I had fallen in but I
think<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:00.719> cool<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.469> sort<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.740> like

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
think that's cool that it's sort of like

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.730 
think that's cool that it's sort of like
one<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.219> games<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:04.200> gets<00:02:04.590> my

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
interest is one of those like little
different<00:02:06.600> games<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.290> because

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
different games it's not just because

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.290 
different games it's not just because
jack<00:02:07.829> black<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.369> voice<00:02:08.610> actor<00:02:09.000> which<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
jack black is the voice actor which is
still<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:10.289> cool<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:10.709> jack<00:02:11.069> black<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
still really cool because jack black is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
but it does look like a really

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.970 
but it does look like a really
interesting<00:02:15.630> game<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.740> look<00:02:16.920> forward
