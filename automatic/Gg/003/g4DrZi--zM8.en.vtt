00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
body to do is look that number up and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.419 
body to do is look that number up and
that's<00:02:08.590> already<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.950> their<00:02:09.040> system<00:02:09.340> they

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
that's already in their system they

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.570 
that's already in their system they
already<00:02:09.550> know<00:02:09.700> what<00:02:09.820> they<00:02:09.880> did<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:11.530> I'm<00:02:11.680> here

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.650 

says<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> rods<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.150> mains<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.540> took

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
says the rods in the mains it took

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
says the rods in the mains it took
10,000<00:02:17.290> -<00:02:17.380> oh<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.709> measured<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.340> mains<00:02:18.520> on

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
10,000 - oh I just measured the mains on

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.780 
10,000 - oh I just measured the mains on
and<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:20.020> actuality<00:02:20.410> they<00:02:21.400> actually<00:02:21.670> took

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and all actuality they actually took

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.100 
and all actuality they actually took
9,000<00:02:22.480> off<00:02:22.600> which<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.959> okay<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.490> means

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
9,000 off which is okay because it means

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.150 
9,000 off which is okay because it means
they<00:02:26.110> didn't<00:02:26.290> grind<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.590> much<00:02:26.740> off<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
they didn't grind as much off the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760 
they didn't grind as much off the
surface<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.140> go<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> put<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.620> back

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
surface so when I go to put this back

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.680 
surface so when I go to put this back
together<00:02:29.920> with<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.370> new<00:02:30.550> bearings<00:02:30.910> it's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
together with the new bearings it's

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.410 
together with the new bearings it's
actually<00:02:31.959> going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> tighter<00:02:32.530> tolerance

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
actually going to be a tighter tolerance

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.340 
actually going to be a tighter tolerance
which<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.570> good<00:02:34.750> because<00:02:34.840> I'm<00:02:35.050> going<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> be

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
which is good because I'm going to be

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.610 
which is good because I'm going to be
towing<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:35.890> Jeep<00:02:36.100> just<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.490> little<00:02:36.700> bit

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
towing with this Jeep just a little bit

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
towing with this Jeep just a little bit
so<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.800> tighter<00:02:38.980> tolerance<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.580> in

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
so the tighter tolerance you have in

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.880 
so the tighter tolerance you have in
your<00:02:39.760> motor<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.900> better<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.739> for

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
your motor the better it is you know for

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.030 
your motor the better it is you know for
telling<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.190> stuff<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.680> ordered<00:02:44.950> new

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
telling it stuff so they ordered new

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.820 
telling it stuff so they ordered new
Pistons<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> kit<00:02:49.350> they<00:02:50.350> did<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> press

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
Pistons with the kit they did the press

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.580 
Pistons with the kit they did the press
work<00:02:51.070> because<00:02:51.730> these<00:02:51.910> wrist<00:02:52.900> pins<00:02:53.170> are<00:02:53.350> pushed

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
work because these wrist pins are pushed

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.410 
work because these wrist pins are pushed
into<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.070> end<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.550> rods<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.440> if<00:02:56.440> you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
into the end of the rods and if you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.340 
into the end of the rods and if you
really<00:02:58.420> don't<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:58.750> what<00:02:58.840> you're<00:02:58.959> doing<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
really don't know what you're doing I

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.320 
really don't know what you're doing I
really<00:02:59.830> wouldn't<00:03:00.070> suggest<00:03:00.220> doing<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.670> even<00:03:01.150> me

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
really wouldn't suggest doing it even me

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.580 
really wouldn't suggest doing it even me
being<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.720> machinist<00:03:02.110> I'm<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.410> comfortable

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
being a machinist I'm not comfortable

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430 
being a machinist I'm not comfortable
pressing<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.400> pins<00:03:03.959> because<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.110> got<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.320> heat

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
pressing in pins because you got to heat

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.020 
pressing in pins because you got to heat
up<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.620> rods<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.489> got<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.670> press<00:03:06.850> these

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.080 
up the rods and you got to press these
pins<00:03:07.299> into<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.600> certain<00:03:07.870> point<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.610> really

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
pins into a certain point and you really

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.640 
pins into a certain point and you really
gotta<00:03:10.209> know<00:03:10.330> what<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.510> doing<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.170> handed

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.900 
it off to these guys now when I sent
these<00:03:15.489> Pistons<00:03:16.030> over<00:03:17.250> these<00:03:18.250> were<00:03:18.459> marked<00:03:18.760> up

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
these Pistons over these were marked up

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.830 
these Pistons over these were marked up
in<00:03:19.090> bags<00:03:19.410> number<00:03:20.410> one<00:03:20.820> two<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.390> on<00:03:22.420> through

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
in bags number one two and so on through

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.120 
in bags number one two and so on through
six<00:03:23.820> now<00:03:24.820> what<00:03:25.000> they<00:03:25.090> did<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.739> bottom<00:03:26.860> of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
six now what they did on the bottom of

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.780 
six now what they did on the bottom of
each<00:03:27.280> rod<00:03:27.840> they<00:03:28.840> marked<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.350> one<00:03:31.230> through<00:03:32.230> six

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
each rod they marked it one through six

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.130 
each rod they marked it one through six
so<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.940> way<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.090> know<00:03:34.299> which<00:03:34.420> cylinders<00:03:34.930> they

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
so that way I know which cylinders they

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.370 
so that way I know which cylinders they
go<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.440> into<00:03:36.570> like<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:37.690> said<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.049> makes<00:03:38.260> it

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
go back into like I said it makes it

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.229 
go back into like I said it makes it
easy<00:03:38.590> when<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:38.950> bag<00:03:39.160> stuff<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.820> can<00:03:40.060> mark

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
easy when you bag stuff and you can mark

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.870 
easy when you bag stuff and you can mark
up<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.450> bags<00:03:41.280> cylinders<00:03:42.280> one<00:03:42.459> through<00:03:42.640> six

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
up the bags cylinders one through six

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.660 
up the bags cylinders one through six
valves<00:03:43.239> one<00:03:43.480> through<00:03:43.690> twelve<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.490> makes

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
valves one through twelve it just makes

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.699 
valves one through twelve it just makes
it<00:03:45.730> really<00:03:45.790> easy<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:47.050> go<00:03:47.140> back<00:03:47.170> together<00:03:47.440> and

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
it really easy to go back together and

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:48.690 
it really easy to go back together and
especially<00:03:47.890> if<00:03:48.069> you're<00:03:48.160> handing<00:03:48.370> stuff<00:03:48.459> off

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
especially if you're handing stuff off

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.320 
especially if you're handing stuff off
to<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:48.880> machine

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
to a machine

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.050 
to a machine
they<00:03:50.020> know<00:03:50.170> what<00:03:50.290> they're<00:03:50.440> working<00:03:50.590> with<00:03:51.060> they

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
they know what they're working with they

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.560 
they know what they're working with they
know<00:03:52.180> what<00:03:52.300> they<00:03:52.420> got<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.660> do<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:54.270> because<00:03:55.270> of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
know what they got to do so because of

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.950 
know what they got to do so because of
that<00:03:55.720> because<00:03:56.560> me<00:03:56.890> marking<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.280> stuff<00:03:57.460> up

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
that because me marking this stuff up

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.830 
that because me marking this stuff up
they<00:03:58.960> know<00:03:59.230> automatically<00:04:00.510> which<00:04:01.510> way<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
they know automatically which way the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.470 
they know automatically which way the
Pistons<00:04:02.260> gotta<00:04:02.440> face<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:03.940> can<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.240> there

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
Pistons gotta face and you can see there

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.540 
Pistons gotta face and you can see there
it<00:04:04.690> says<00:04:04.750> point<00:04:05.170> zero<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.680> zero<00:04:06.100> which<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.460> the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
it says point zero to zero which is the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.120 
it says point zero to zero which is the
twenty<00:04:06.790> thousand<00:04:07.210> so<00:04:07.330> Versailles<00:04:08.130> which

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
twenty thousand so Versailles which

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.800 
twenty thousand so Versailles which
means<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.640> bore<00:04:09.850> on<00:04:10.060> my<00:04:10.270> block<00:04:10.510> has<00:04:10.660> been

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
means that the bore on my block has been

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.260 
means that the bore on my block has been
bored<00:04:11.380> out<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.800> cross-hatched<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.090> honed

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
bored out and cross-hatched and honed

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.360 
bored out and cross-hatched and honed
twenty<00:04:13.810> thousand<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.290> verso<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.950> piston

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
twenty thousand so verso this piston

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.050 
twenty thousand so verso this piston
will<00:04:16.239> match<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.540> size<00:04:16.690> for<00:04:16.959> size<00:04:17.110> so<00:04:17.890> this<00:04:18.880> is

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
will match the size for size so this is

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.449 
will match the size for size so this is
actually<00:04:19.360> matched<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:20.140> cylinder<00:04:20.380> one<00:04:20.650> and

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
actually matched to cylinder one and

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.250 
actually matched to cylinder one and
then<00:04:21.730> all<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.060> way<00:04:22.150> through<00:04:22.390> so<00:04:22.690> they

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
then all the way through so they

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.380 
then all the way through so they
actually<00:04:23.410> matched<00:04:23.920> all<00:04:24.250> these<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:25.120> it's<00:04:25.240> very

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
actually matched all these so it's very

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.780 
actually matched all these so it's very
important<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.020> arrow<00:04:26.620> there<00:04:26.790> designates

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
important that arrow there designates

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.670 
important that arrow there designates
the<00:04:28.030> front<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.390> engine<00:04:28.540> because<00:04:29.440> there<00:04:29.590> is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
the front of the engine because there is

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.760 
the front of the engine because there is
a<00:04:29.710> front<00:04:30.010> there<00:04:30.190> is<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.340> back<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.690> piston<00:04:32.050> if

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
a front there is a back and a piston if

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.100 
a front there is a back and a piston if
you<00:04:32.890> notice<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> grooves<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.840> that's

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
you notice that the grooves and that's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.990 
you notice that the grooves and that's
in<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.530> casting<00:04:35.920> is<00:04:36.190> different<00:04:36.610> from<00:04:36.700> side<00:04:36.970> to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
in the casting is different from side to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.700 
in the casting is different from side to
side<00:04:37.120> it's<00:04:37.900> thicker<00:04:38.080> over<00:04:38.320> there<00:04:38.470> thinner

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
side it's thicker over there thinner

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.020 
side it's thicker over there thinner
over<00:04:38.860> there<00:04:39.040> it's<00:04:39.460> because<00:04:39.610> your<00:04:39.850> valve

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
over there it's because your valve

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.840 
over there it's because your valve
clearance<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.600> stuff<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:42.130> it's<00:04:42.460> very

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
clearance and stuff so it's very

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.070 
clearance and stuff so it's very
important<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.480> put<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:43.780> all<00:04:43.960> back

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
important that you put this all back

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.420 
important that you put this all back
together<00:04:44.290> right<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.690> rods<00:04:46.690> with<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> proper

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
together right and rods with the proper

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.530 
together right and rods with the proper
proper<00:04:48.430> uh<00:04:48.750> cylinder<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:51.430> forth<00:04:51.700> now<00:04:51.910> I

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
proper uh cylinder and so forth now I

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.560 
proper uh cylinder and so forth now I
got<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.810> new<00:04:52.930> piston<00:04:53.680> ring<00:04:53.860> set<00:04:54.040> over<00:04:54.190> there

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
got the new piston ring set over there

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.659 
got the new piston ring set over there
it's<00:04:55.570> also<00:04:55.720> going<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:55.960> be<00:04:56.020> going<00:04:56.110> in<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:56.669> in

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
it's also going to be going in it so in

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.840 
it's also going to be going in it so in
the<00:04:57.760> meantime<00:04:59.310> I'm<00:05:00.310> going<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.490> cover<00:05:00.669> this

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
the meantime I'm going to cover this

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.450 
the meantime I'm going to cover this
stuff<00:05:01.060> up<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.620> I'm<00:05:02.710> going<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.950> focus<00:05:03.100> in<00:05:03.340> on

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
stuff up and I'm going to focus in on

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.880 
stuff up and I'm going to focus in on
this<00:05:04.890> they<00:05:05.890> board<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.310> honed<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:08.530> can<00:05:08.680> see

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
this they board it honed it you can see

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.650 
this they board it honed it you can see
in<00:05:09.010> here<00:05:09.220> there's<00:05:09.460> crosshatch<00:05:10.210> which<00:05:10.419> means

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
in here there's crosshatch which means

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.340 
in here there's crosshatch which means
that<00:05:11.580> there<00:05:12.580> is<00:05:12.700> cross<00:05:12.910> hatching<00:05:13.390> that's<00:05:13.930> done

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
that there is cross hatching that's done

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.960 
that there is cross hatching that's done
by<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> specific<00:05:14.800> machine<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.550> don't<00:05:15.820> have

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
by a specific machine that I don't have

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.810 
by a specific machine that I don't have
in<00:05:16.180> my<00:05:16.210> own<00:05:16.450> machine<00:05:16.690> shop<00:05:17.460> they've<00:05:18.460> got<00:05:18.640> new

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
in my own machine shop they've got new

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.230 
in my own machine shop they've got new
cam<00:05:19.060> bearings<00:05:19.390> in<00:05:19.600> here<00:05:20.669> all<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.940> way<00:05:22.000> through

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
cam bearings in here all the way through

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.280 
cam bearings in here all the way through
all<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.930> way<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.320> front<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:26.169> new

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
all the way to the front the new

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.690 
all the way to the front the new
bearings<00:05:26.620> will<00:05:26.740> fit<00:05:26.890> in<00:05:27.010> here<00:05:27.220> these<00:05:27.370> are<00:05:27.430> your

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
bearings will fit in here these are your

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.360 
bearings will fit in here these are your
mains<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:29.110> then<00:05:29.890> down<00:05:30.130> in<00:05:30.280> here<00:05:32.100> I'm<00:05:33.100> going<00:05:33.280> to

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
mains and then down in here I'm going to

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.730 
mains and then down in here I'm going to
make<00:05:33.520> sure<00:05:33.669> that<00:05:33.700> those<00:05:33.940> new<00:05:34.180> lifters<00:05:34.740> get

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
make sure that those new lifters get

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.860 
make sure that those new lifters get
perfectly<00:05:36.130> in<00:05:36.280> there

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
perfectly in there

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.840 
perfectly in there
so<00:05:37.870> in<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.020> meantime<00:05:38.169> they<00:05:38.560> actually<00:05:38.890> uh<00:05:38.919> also

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
so in the meantime they actually uh also

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.420 
so in the meantime they actually uh also
put<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.120> in<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.440> new<00:05:41.440> freeze<00:05:41.740> plugs<00:05:41.980> for<00:05:42.250> me<00:05:42.370> and

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
put it in a new freeze plugs for me and

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.860 
put it in a new freeze plugs for me and
new<00:05:45.430> oil<00:05:45.640> plugs<00:05:45.940> all<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.480> way<00:05:46.540> through<00:05:46.780> the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
new oil plugs all the way through the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.110 
new oil plugs all the way through the
block<00:05:47.020> because<00:05:47.380> there's<00:05:47.590> some<00:05:47.740> on<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.000> in<00:05:49.000> the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
block because there's some on the in the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.980 
block because there's some on the in the
sides<00:05:49.360> well<00:05:49.750> I<00:05:50.050> do<00:05:50.200> believe<00:05:50.470> I<00:05:50.800> can't<00:05:51.070> remember

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
sides well I do believe I can't remember

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.220 
sides well I do believe I can't remember
yeah

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
yeah

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.760 
yeah
just<00:05:53.530> one

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
just one

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.040 
just one
here<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:57.460> meantime<00:05:57.720> while<00:05:58.720> all<00:05:58.870> that

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
here so the meantime while all that

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.110 
here so the meantime while all that
stuff<00:05:59.289> is<00:05:59.440> sitting<00:05:59.620> all<00:05:59.860> covered<00:06:00.129> up<00:06:00.250> oh<00:06:00.430> yeah

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
stuff is sitting all covered up oh yeah

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.869 
stuff is sitting all covered up oh yeah
also<00:06:01.449> new<00:06:01.720> gaskets<00:06:02.139> make<00:06:02.379> sure<00:06:02.500> you<00:06:02.590> have<00:06:02.879> go

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879
