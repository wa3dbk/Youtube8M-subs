00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.100 
into this pack opening we got Tevez here
by<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:08.700> thinking<00:01:09.030> about<00:01:09.330> not

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
by the way I'm really thinking about not

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
by the way I'm really thinking about not
crossing<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.830> million<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.280> thinking<00:01:11.549> about

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
crossing a million I'm thinking about

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.590 
crossing a million I'm thinking about
leaving<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.090> 500k<00:01:12.750> 500,000<00:01:13.680> people<00:01:13.770> points

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
leaving it at 500k 500,000 people points

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
leaving it at 500k 500,000 people points
so<00:01:15.600> they'll<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> part<00:01:16.140> 3<00:01:16.409> part<00:01:16.439> 4<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.950> 5<00:01:17.100> part

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so they'll be a part 3 part 4 and 5 part

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
so they'll be a part 3 part 4 and 5 part
5<00:01:17.759> instead<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> whole<00:01:18.869> 1<00:01:19.110> million

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
5 instead of going the whole 1 million

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440

with a mic in front of me that's why I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.630 
with a mic in front of me that's why I
really<00:03:27.680> thought<00:03:27.890> about<00:03:27.950> cutting<00:03:28.400> the

shinji<00:03:33.470> kagawa<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.489> i<00:03:34.610> thought<00:03:34.790> i<00:03:34.850> would<00:03:34.970> do

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
shinji kagawa and i thought i would do

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.360 
shinji kagawa and i thought i would do
like<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.019> certain<00:03:36.320> occasions<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:36.920> every

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
like on certain occasions like every

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.000 
like on certain occasions like every
week<00:03:37.549> 12,000<00:03:38.330> fifa<00:03:38.570> points<00:03:38.750> instead<00:03:39.620> then<00:03:39.950> I

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
week 12,000 fifa points instead then I

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.130 
week 12,000 fifa points instead then I
can<00:03:40.160> do<00:03:40.280> live<00:03:40.690> commentary<00:03:41.690> because<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:41.989> not

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
can do live commentary because it's not

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.330 
can do live commentary because it's not
a<00:03:42.170> lot<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.410> people<00:03:42.620> cause<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:42.950> think<00:03:43.010> that's<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
a lot of people cause I think that's the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.610 
a lot of people cause I think that's the
best<00:03:43.549> solution<00:03:44.120> even<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:44.840> we<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.170> boat<00:03:45.380> goes

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
best solution even if we the boat goes

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.979 
best solution even if we the boat goes
going<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.250> 1<00:03:46.400> million<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.880> think<00:03:47.090> 500<00:03:47.450> k<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:47.720> more

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
going to 1 million I think 500 k is more

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.300 
going to 1 million I think 500 k is more
reasonable<00:03:48.200> that's<00:03:48.650> still<00:03:48.829> not<00:03:48.920> reasonable

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
reasonable that's still not reasonable

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.430 
reasonable that's still not reasonable
primary<00:03:49.610> kids<00:03:49.760> ridiculous<00:03:50.360> amount<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
primary kids ridiculous amount but you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.900 
primary kids ridiculous amount but you
know<00:03:51.530> what<00:03:51.620> i<00:03:51.709> mean<00:03:51.860> there's<00:03:52.100> James<00:03:52.340> Rodriguez

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
know what i mean there's James Rodriguez

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.970 
know what i mean there's James Rodriguez
we<00:03:53.090> get<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.480> pack<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:54.590> think<00:03:54.799> that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980
