00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
just for clarification I mean you can

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.100 
just for clarification I mean you can
see<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> car<00:00:35.430> prevents<00:00:36.149> both<00:00:36.329> players<00:00:36.930> from

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
see the car prevents both players from

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.869 
see the car prevents both players from
activating<00:00:37.410> spell<00:00:37.739> cards<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.489> problem<00:00:38.790> is

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
activating spell cards the problem is

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
activating spell cards the problem is
that<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.239> level<00:00:39.480> 5<00:00:39.870> monster<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.680> 1,800

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that it's level 5 monster with 1,800

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.540 
that it's level 5 monster with 1,800
attack<00:00:41.250> points<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> against<00:00:43.320> neck<00:00:43.980> cause<00:00:44.160> if

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
attack points so against neck cause if

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
attack points so against neck cause if
they<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:44.940> open<00:00:45.390> field<00:00:45.750> yeah<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> guess

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
they have an open field yeah I guess

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
they have an open field yeah I guess
it's<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.270> summon<00:00:48.420> at

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's pretty good if you can summon at

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's pretty good if you can summon at
first<00:00:48.750> turn<00:00:48.960> no<00:00:49.289> Dex<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
first turn no Dex can really do that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.840 
first turn no Dex can really do that
besides<00:00:51.170> burning<00:00:52.170> abyss<00:00:52.610> pretty<00:00:53.610> much<00:00:53.730> only

think<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> might<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.210> been<00:01:48.299> seven<00:01:48.720> though

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
think it might have been seven though

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
think it might have been seven though
but<00:01:49.740> anyway<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.220> he<00:01:50.399> has<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> shit<00:01:50.790> ton<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
but anyway we know he has a shit ton of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
but anyway we know he has a shit ton of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
channel has quite a bit of following and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
channel has quite a bit of following and
we<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.570> his<00:01:54.950> followers<00:01:56.030> pay<00:01:57.030> attention<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
we know his followers pay attention to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
we know his followers pay attention to
what<00:01:57.600> he<00:01:57.689> says<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.310> seeing<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
what he says so what we're seeing is a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.440 
what he says so what we're seeing is a
situation<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.270> artificial<00:02:00.810> hype<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.369> gage<00:02:02.450> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
situation of artificial hype on gage and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
situation of artificial hype on gage and
I<00:02:03.600> can't<00:02:04.049> say<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.259> sure<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.920> happened

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I can't say for sure this what happened

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.240 
I can't say for sure this what happened
but<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.420> seems<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:08.009> found

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
but it pretty much seems like he found

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
but it pretty much seems like he found
that<00:02:08.489> he<00:02:08.759> had<00:02:08.819> six<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.479> seven<00:02:09.750> copies<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.110> an

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that he had six or seven copies of an

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
that he had six or seven copies of an
old<00:02:10.649> ultra<00:02:11.069> rare<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.430> no<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:11.849> played

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
old ultra rare that no one played

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.700 
old ultra rare that no one played
because<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.840> bad

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
because it's really bad

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
because it's really bad
and<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:13.980> decided<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.370> hype<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.600> sell

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and then decided to hype it up to sell

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.920 
and then decided to hype it up to sell
his<00:02:16.230> copies<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> that's<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.630> that's<00:02:18.630> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
his copies and that's like that's a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.210 
his copies and that's like that's a
perfect<00:02:19.590> business<00:02:20.090> model<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:22.080> mean<00:02:23.010> he

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
perfect business model because I mean he

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.770 
perfect business model because I mean he
probably<00:02:23.370> picked<00:02:23.640> him<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:23.850> four<00:02:24.030> dollars<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
probably picked him up four dollars and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.930 
probably picked him up four dollars and
then<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.200> wow<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:26.130> kind<00:02:26.820> of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
then was like wow I I'm kind of

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.240 
then was like wow I I'm kind of
influential<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.380> probably<00:02:28.830> move<00:02:29.010> these

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
influential I can probably move these

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.150 
influential I can probably move these
and<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.330> mean<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> very<00:02:30.780> least<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.560> don't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
and I mean at the very least I don't

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.530 
and I mean at the very least I don't
know<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.430> he<00:02:32.520> thought<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> would<00:02:32.880> get<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.330> big

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
know if he thought it would get this big

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.960 
know if he thought it would get this big
where<00:02:33.780> they<00:02:33.870> were<00:02:33.960> like<00:02:34.170> 20<00:02:34.560> 25<00:02:34.800> 30<00:02:35.520> dollars

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
where they were like 20 25 30 dollars

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.310 
where they were like 20 25 30 dollars
maybe<00:02:36.600> he<00:02:36.720> thought<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:36.960> would<00:02:37.050> only<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
maybe he thought they would only go to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.610 
maybe he thought they would only go to
10<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.790> case<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.510> mean<00:02:40.320> he's<00:02:40.440> still

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
10 in which case I mean he's still

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.250 
10 in which case I mean he's still
profits<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.190> still<00:02:41.370> free<00:02:41.640> money<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.570> uh<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
profits it's still free money but uh and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.440 
profits it's still free money but uh and
this<00:02:43.440> happens<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.950> lot<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.400> mean<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.670> happen

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
this happens a lot I mean this happen

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.400

cards<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:52.320> either<00:02:52.470> artificially<00:02:53.190> hype<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.440 
problem is is that those ones all seemed
really<00:02:57.660> obvious<00:02:58.320> but<00:02:58.910> gage<00:02:59.910> is<00:02:59.940> really

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
really obvious but gage is really

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.100 
really obvious but gage is really
pulling<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.960> off<00:03:01.110> where<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.750> seems

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
I first saw this video I was like okay I

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.750 
I first saw this video I was like okay I
guess<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.620> an<00:03:10.740> interesting<00:03:10.980> topic<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.640> then

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
guess it's an interesting topic but then

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.160 
guess it's an interesting topic but then
when<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.910> saw<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> he<00:03:12.360> had<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.600> six<00:03:12.900> or<00:03:12.990> seven

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
when I saw the he had like six or seven

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.710 
when I saw the he had like six or seven
that<00:03:13.440> he<00:03:13.530> was<00:03:13.650> selling<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.720> fairly

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
that he was selling it was like fairly

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.840 
that he was selling it was like fairly
obvious<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.500> he<00:03:17.070> was<00:03:17.220> only<00:03:17.400> doing<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.820> to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
obvious that he was only doing it to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.760 
obvious that he was only doing it to
make<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.090> quick<00:03:18.270> profit<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.590> wanna

back stock on just to get rid of them
and<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:34.170> I<00:03:34.260> said<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:36.090> kind<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.420> an

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
and like I said that it is kind of an

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.840 
and like I said that it is kind of an
awkward<00:03:36.750> situation<00:03:37.020> because<00:03:37.410> he<00:03:37.770> has<00:03:37.890> four

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
awkward situation because he has four

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.400 
awkward situation because he has four
times<00:03:39.120> as<00:03:39.240> many<00:03:39.330> subscribers<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:40.050> me<00:03:40.200> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
times as many subscribers as me and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.530 
times as many subscribers as me and
because<00:03:40.980> i<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.370> most<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.820> his<00:03:41.940> content<00:03:42.360> I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
because i like most of his content I

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.260 
because i like most of his content I
just<00:03:42.750> felt<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.080> this<00:03:43.200> particular<00:03:43.410> situation

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
just felt that this particular situation

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.380 
just felt that this particular situation
was<00:03:45.270> handled<00:03:45.510> badly<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.530> mean<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.280> don't<00:03:48.150> have

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
was handled badly I mean I don't have

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.480 
was handled badly I mean I don't have
enough<00:03:48.720> subscribers<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.830> do<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.160> kind<00:03:50.400> of

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
enough subscribers to do this kind of

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.380 
enough subscribers to do this kind of
move<00:03:50.700> but<00:03:51.600> with<00:03:51.810> his<00:03:52.470> kind<00:03:52.710> of<00:03:52.890> sub<00:03:53.820> count<00:03:54.090> he

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
move but with his kind of sub count he

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.570 
move but with his kind of sub count he
can<00:03:54.570> definitely<00:03:54.690> do<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.710> don't<00:03:56.520> know

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
can definitely do this and I don't know

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.480 
can definitely do this and I don't know
I'm<00:03:57.270> afraid<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.080> other<00:03:58.620> channels<00:03:59.190> are<00:03:59.340> going

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
I'm afraid that other channels are going

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.280 
I'm afraid that other channels are going
to<00:03:59.550> take<00:03:59.730> note<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.570> something<00:04:00.990> you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
to take note that this is something you

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.130 
to take note that this is something you
can<00:04:01.440> do<00:04:01.680> if<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.000> see<00:04:03.210> someone<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.570> em<00:04:03.900> Cole

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
can do if you see someone like em Cole

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.800 
can do if you see someone like em Cole

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
is not a good trend and hopefully no one

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.640 
is not a good trend and hopefully no one
