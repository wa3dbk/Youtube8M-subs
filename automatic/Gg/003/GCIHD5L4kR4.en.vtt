on<00:00:12.620> the<00:00:12.890> water<00:00:13.070> today

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
on the water today

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.450 
on the water today
and<00:00:13.790> build<00:00:14.420> some<00:00:14.780> custom<00:00:14.990> maps<00:00:15.560> for<00:00:16.309> this

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
and build some custom maps for this

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.670 
and build some custom maps for this
particular<00:00:16.880> body<00:00:17.330> of<00:00:17.510> water<00:00:17.660> now<00:00:17.930> I<00:00:17.960> fish<00:00:18.410> this

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
particular body of water now I fish this

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.370 
particular body of water now I fish this
lake<00:00:19.130> for<00:00:19.160> over<00:00:19.670> 40<00:00:20.030> years<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:20.810> I<00:00:20.870> kind<00:00:21.140> of<00:00:21.200> know

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
lake for over 40 years so I kind of know

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.590 
lake for over 40 years so I kind of know
it<00:00:21.500> like<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.710> back<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.280> my<00:00:22.430> hand<00:00:22.850> at<00:00:23.240> least<00:00:23.420> I

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
it like the back of my hand at least I

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.370 
it like the back of my hand at least I
think<00:00:23.660> I<00:00:23.990> do

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
think I do

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.740 
think I do
what's<00:00:24.860> custom<00:00:25.400> mapping<00:00:25.700> gonna<00:00:26.119> do<00:00:26.360> for<00:00:26.630> me

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
what's custom mapping gonna do for me

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.330 
what's custom mapping gonna do for me
for<00:00:27.020> an<00:00:27.110> angler<00:00:27.440> that's<00:00:27.740> been<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.039> a<00:00:28.070> body

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
for an angler that's been on a body

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.220 
for an angler that's been on a body
water<00:00:28.640> for<00:00:28.940> years<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.330> years<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:29.510> years<00:00:29.780> lots

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
water for years and years and years lots

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.260 
water for years and years and years lots
of<00:00:30.350> lakes<00:00:30.710> haven't<00:00:31.100> been<00:00:31.250> mapped<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.060> that's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
of lakes haven't been mapped and that's

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.790 
of lakes haven't been mapped and that's
why<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:32.509> know<00:00:32.720> custom<00:00:33.020> mapping<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.350> perfect

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
why you know custom mapping is perfect

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.950 
why you know custom mapping is perfect
for<00:00:33.950> those<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:34.700> this<00:00:34.850> Lake<00:00:35.120> has<00:00:35.570> actually

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
for those but this Lake has actually

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.080 
for those but this Lake has actually
been<00:00:36.140> mapped<00:00:36.440> but<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:37.130> was<00:00:37.250> likely<00:00:37.910> done<00:00:38.060> a

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
been mapped but it was likely done a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.910 
been mapped but it was likely done a
long<00:00:38.390> time<00:00:38.450> ago<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.200> croute<00:00:39.530> with<00:00:39.649> crude

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
long time ago and croute with crude

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.740 
long time ago and croute with crude
techniques<00:00:40.340> in<00:00:40.760> addition<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.390> detailed

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
techniques in addition to the detailed

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.050 
techniques in addition to the detailed
contour<00:00:42.260> as<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.470> get<00:00:42.649> inside<00:00:43.160> genesis<00:00:43.640> also

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
contour as you get inside genesis also

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.240 
contour as you get inside genesis also
provides<00:00:44.420> vegetation<00:00:45.260> data<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:45.890> just<00:00:46.100> shows

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
provides vegetation data that just shows

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.620 
provides vegetation data that just shows
you<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> weed<00:00:46.640> lines<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:47.390> shows<00:00:47.540> you

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
you the weed lines and it shows you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.150 
you the weed lines and it shows you
bottom<00:00:47.930> composition<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.739> shows<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.070> the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
bottom composition that shows you the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.979 
bottom composition that shows you the
transition<00:00:49.760> from<00:00:49.910> hard<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.300> soft<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.750> that's

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
transition from hard to soft and that's

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.930 
transition from hard to soft and that's
detail<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.590> won't<00:00:51.770> get<00:00:51.920> anywhere<00:00:52.190> else<00:00:52.340> then

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
detail you won't get anywhere else then

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.790 
detail you won't get anywhere else then
that's<00:00:53.090> very<00:00:53.510> important<00:00:54.079> especially<00:00:54.469> for

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
that's very important especially for

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.799 
that's very important especially for
fish<00:00:55.219> location<00:00:55.850> or<00:00:55.940> where<00:00:56.090> they<00:00:56.239> hold<00:00:56.390> on<00:00:56.600> are

fish location or where they hold on are

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.110 
fish location or where they hold on are
giving<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.380> spot<00:00:57.620> exactly<00:01:00.550> hey<00:01:01.550> Michael<00:01:01.969> I'm

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
giving the spot exactly hey Michael I'm

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.809 
giving the spot exactly hey Michael I'm
sliding<00:01:02.690> up<00:01:02.809> onto<00:01:03.410> my<00:01:03.559> number<00:01:03.620> one<00:01:04.399> fish

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:04.819 
sliding up onto my number one fish

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.969 
sliding up onto my number one fish
producing<00:01:05.449> spot<00:01:05.719> on<00:01:05.899> this<00:01:06.109> Lake<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.709> it's<00:01:06.859> a

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
producing spot on this Lake and it's a

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.550 
producing spot on this Lake and it's a
long<00:01:07.219> bar<00:01:07.579> that<00:01:08.240> intersects<00:01:08.929> the<00:01:09.109> lake<00:01:09.289> and<00:01:09.499> a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
long bar that intersects the lake and a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.620 
long bar that intersects the lake and a
lot<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.100> bodies<00:01:10.639> of<00:01:10.789> water<00:01:10.939> up<00:01:11.209> here<00:01:11.509> in

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
lot of the bodies of water up here in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.050 
lot of the bodies of water up here in
northern<00:01:11.990> Minnesota<00:01:12.049> or<00:01:13.009> old<00:01:13.399> glacier<00:01:13.850> Lakes

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
northern Minnesota or old glacier Lakes

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.239 
northern Minnesota or old glacier Lakes
so<00:01:14.329> they<00:01:14.450> have<00:01:14.600> lots<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:15.139> rock<00:01:15.709> and<00:01:16.039> rubble

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
so they have lots of rock and rubble

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.309 
so they have lots of rock and rubble
deposits<00:01:17.029> on<00:01:17.209> it<00:01:17.389> now<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:17.959> this<00:01:18.109> particular
