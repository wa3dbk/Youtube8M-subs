00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
space and unfortunately coronate didn't

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
space and unfortunately coronate didn't
manage<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> convert<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.280> chance<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:05.820> but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
manage to convert the chance there but

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.580 
manage to convert the chance there but
we<00:01:06.119> were<00:01:06.570> doing<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> were<00:01:07.140> doing<00:01:07.320> over

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
we were doing that we were doing over

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289 
we were doing that we were doing over
the<00:01:07.680> top<00:01:07.860> balls<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> again<00:01:08.760> sort<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> same

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the top balls and again sort of the same

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
the top balls and again sort of the same
position<00:01:09.780> same<00:01:10.229> shot<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> he<00:01:10.770> took<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.159> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
position same shot that he took on but

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.590 
position same shot that he took on but
still<00:01:11.640> couldn't<00:01:11.909> find<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> net

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
still couldn't find the back of the net

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
still couldn't find the back of the net
so<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> basically<00:01:13.080> had<00:01:13.890> four<00:01:14.159> chances<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so we basically had four chances in

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
so we basically had four chances in
space<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.090> 30<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.600> Game<00:01:15.810> minutes<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.609 
space of 30 in Game minutes and this is
what<00:01:17.250> happens<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.900> dominating
