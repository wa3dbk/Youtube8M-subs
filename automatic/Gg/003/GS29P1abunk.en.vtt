handsome<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.969> it's<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.530> spoof<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.860> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
handsome and it's a spoof on a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.330 
handsome and it's a spoof on a
fundamentalist<00:01:19.240> Christian<00:01:19.950> button<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.189> is

Mojave<00:01:58.420> win<00:01:58.899> at<00:01:59.020> least<00:01:59.170> is<00:02:00.179> actually<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.479> war

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
Mojave win at least is actually the war

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.020 
Mojave win at least is actually the war
