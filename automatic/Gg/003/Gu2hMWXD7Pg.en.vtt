00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:11.570
 there is an evolution in football 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.090
 a few years ago when there was a corner 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.830
 especially in the Aztec when there was 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.660
 people when there were good transmissions 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.400
 there was a corner for example in favor of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:31.000
 america and the whole stadium was screaming go go 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.250
 because at that time critics like 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.900
 don fernando marcos fernandez angel 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.570
 lark of 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.070
 we teach people that the corner 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.070
 it was half a goal 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.920
 2 fernando marcos was technical director 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.780
 he made the toluca champion 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.789
 in such a way that he knew what 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.630
 I was talking a corner 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.750
 it has to be half a goal 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.140
 in such a way that people felt it and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.250
 shouted goal before they execute the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.040
 corner sometimes I went out sometimes I did not go out 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 today 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.660
 to talk about an important variant if 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 you commit faults in the boundaries of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.710
 big area scolds you the technician because 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.740
 says you exposed the team to that one shot 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 direct from them they hit us a goal nobody 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.230
 will commit faults in the boundaries of the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.810
 large area they realize 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.370
 but now the monterrey has another form 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.820
 to kill 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.590
 in the way to tell the players 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.800
 do not go committing a mistake in the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.740
 midfield and midfield is a place 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.420
 of battle where the faults are 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 common 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 and now missing in the half court results 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.710
 A stationary golf is very nearly 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.710
 half goal 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.380
 the ball is not placed the pacifier is 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.200
 pull back and make the sign 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.770
 if you raise your left hand 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 out there is the second suit if you raise the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:24.780
 right hand out there is the first stick 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.030
 If you crouch down and an average 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.090
 better is telling you I'm going to give the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.049
 pass through so someone comes out and pulls 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.500
 on the defensive there are many ways but 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.659
 a ball in the half court is already 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.109
 problem for the opposing team 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.120
 tigers must have learned in that 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.610
 goal that they scored in this last 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.540
 classic that just happened 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.950
 against blue cross there were no goals 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.280
 because God is great but against the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.450
 saints of the lagoon the same shot of 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.629
 behind 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.540
 center of the pacifier has it right now 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.430
 Tempeladita those touches of ball have 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.519
 that be like the strings of a violin 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:17.519
 they have to be tense to be able to touch 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.620
 exactly where you want if it happened 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.879
 a little above left to the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.290
 goalkeeper if he was passing less he does not get it 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.159
 there 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.159
 sometimes it happens that the handle of the shooter 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:35.400
 must be between what is the barrier and the 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.739
 doorman if you put it in half could 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.870
 be a moment of danger to advantage 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.590
 for the forwards that are in front 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.329
 that put them in front but if you have 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.579
 good head auctioners like the 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:52.079
 mantaro like the monterrey has waters 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.629
 every time there is a lack in the middle of 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.540
 field and that the pacifier is coming and 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.920
 place the ball and get up with that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.859
 with that air of pride you have and 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.349
 but she says and starts moving 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.010
 players because he already sent them the captain 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.450
 the sign that is going to be at the second post or 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.489
 first stick 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.400
 or how it's going to be, you have to discover 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.930
 the secrets of the signals also in 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.620
 football there are signs 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.169
 if for example you shake this arm or 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.830
 you shake this arm or pull the 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.410
 texas the ear zone all are signs yes 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.449
 you bend down to put the ball after 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.770
 that you already put it on is another sign 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.770
 what is the good 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.400
 today that is going to be a threat a center 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.490
 of the 'pacifier' from the midfield is 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.250
 half goal for the public to 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.880
 tec when they place the hairs of 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.880
 pacifier shout goal before it falls is 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.750
 very nice thank you very much 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.690
 I do not tell you more because there are ladies who 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.789
 They rose through the skin very thin 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.789
 have you very good morning
