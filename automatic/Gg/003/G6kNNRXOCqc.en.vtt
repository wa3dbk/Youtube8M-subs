00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
did like this deck it's a very fun deck

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.269 
did like this deck it's a very fun deck
it<00:00:13.019> had<00:00:13.230> some<00:00:13.469> cool<00:00:13.650> synergies<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:15.830> uh<00:00:16.830> maybe

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
it had some cool synergies and uh maybe

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.490 
it had some cool synergies and uh maybe
maybe<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:18.060> more<00:00:18.210> than<00:00:18.390> heroic<00:00:18.660> route<00:00:18.990> with

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
maybe going more than heroic route with

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
maybe going more than heroic route with
the<00:00:19.980> instead<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> personal<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> Pantheon

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the instead of a personal the Pantheon

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.500 
the instead of a personal the Pantheon
you<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:21.990> first<00:00:22.230> turn<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.910> favorite<00:00:23.910> hoplite

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
you can go first turn a favorite hoplite

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
you can go first turn a favorite hoplite
and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.320> putting<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:25.980> God's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and then putting more like God's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.300 
and then putting more like God's
willings<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.420> might<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.470> route<00:00:29.039> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
willings and might be the right route to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
willings and might be the right route to
go<00:00:29.519> instead<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> Johnny's<00:00:30.960> pride<00:00:31.199> me

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
go instead of like it Johnny's pride me

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.389 
go instead of like it Johnny's pride me
and<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.710> still<00:00:31.890> use<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and you can still use kind of the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.190 
and you can still use kind of the
chronic<00:00:32.730> chronicler<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> heroes<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.870> fleece

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
mainline strategy because we did seem to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
mainline strategy because we did seem to
get<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.930> blown<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.230> any<00:00:37.469> sort<00:00:37.680> of

God's willings more with with a feat of
resistance<00:00:42.870> might<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.860> difference

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
resistance might be the the difference

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.369 
resistance might be the the difference
of<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:45.270> good<00:00:45.510> synergy<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.079> hardened

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
of and it has good synergy with hardened

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.779 
of and it has good synergy with hardened
scales<00:00:46.620> too<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.920> you're<00:00:47.039> doing<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> heroic

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
scales too if you're doing on a heroic

scales too if you're doing on a heroic

hoplite gain two counters instead of one

hoplite gain two counters instead of one
and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> favorite<00:00:53.340> hoplite<00:00:53.610> becomes<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.090> a

and the favorite hoplite becomes a a
threat<00:00:55.399> quite<00:00:56.399> fast<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.109> go

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
threat quite fast and then you could go

threat quite fast and then you could go
the<00:00:58.440> fabled<00:00:58.739> hero<00:00:58.949> it'd<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> lot<00:01:00.030> similar<00:01:00.300> to

play<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> budget<00:01:03.239> deck<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> made<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
play on a budget deck that I made and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
play on a budget deck that I made and
the<00:01:04.110> model<00:01:04.350> why<00:01:04.439> hero<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.769> deck<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.159> made

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the model why hero up deck that I made

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.510 
the model why hero up deck that I made
so<00:01:05.549> I've<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:07.320> overdone<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so I've kind of really overdone that and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
so I've kind of really overdone that and
i<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> show<00:01:09.510> something<00:01:09.810> different<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
i want to show something different go a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.070 
i want to show something different go a
different<00:01:10.650> route<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.960> again<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
different route so that again is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
different route so that again is
extremely<00:01:13.530> fun<00:01:13.680> extremely<00:01:14.070> synergistic

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
extremely fun extremely synergistic

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
extremely fun extremely synergistic

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
of those games though could have gone

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.520 
of those games though could have gone
either<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.869> would<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.020> drawn<00:01:19.320> into

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
either way if we would have drawn into

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
either way if we would have drawn into
that<00:01:19.590> pivotable<00:01:20.189> third<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.610> fourth<00:01:20.790> land<00:01:21.030> drop

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
getting stuck on on the lands with like

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.100 
getting stuck on on the lands with like

resistance if we would drawn to that a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
resistance if we would drawn to that a
lot<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> those<00:01:46.380> games<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.979> had<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> feat<00:01:47.399> of

lot of those games if we had a feat of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
resistance in the in the inner in our

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.539 
resistance in the in the inner in our

Jessica<00:01:55.560> mid-range<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
Jessica mid-range which is really what I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
Jessica mid-range which is really what I
built<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> stock<00:01:57.360> deck<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.469> didn't<00:01:58.649> get

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
built the stock deck for we didn't get

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350

to<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> assault<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.549> control<00:02:00.030> which<00:02:00.240> i

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360

think<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> our<00:02:00.750> absolute<00:02:00.869> worst<00:02:01.290> match<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.710> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
think is our absolute worst match of it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
think is our absolute worst match of it
