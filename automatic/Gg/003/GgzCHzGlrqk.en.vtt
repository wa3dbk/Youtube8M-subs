00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello today I bring you in zelda stories 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.270
 the history of Cuba's gas plants 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.340
 carnivorous plants 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.530
 piranha of mario games so 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.230
 I will begin to explain them from stewart 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.900
 word in this game will appear two types 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 of these ones will be the pq vargas with the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
 possibility that everyone opens their mouths 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.070
 vertically horizontally and apart 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.720
 will be the four bars which are 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.519
 of a cracked yellow color that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.939
 they will have the possibility to open their mouths 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.769
 both horizontally and vertically 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.870
 now rarely minister there is no 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.880
 of this type so I will go to ocarina 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
 of time in which near the cv tree 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.140
 can be found from vats which 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.850
 They are famous for their production of sticks 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.100
 of cv and cv nuts separately 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.930
 you will find the big Cuban women who 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.539
 will be more frequent in the version of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.309
 master quest now in improvements more than 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.039
 will appear apart from those previously 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.750
 named the smallest mini vaga 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.789
 than those of Cuba if he saw them from Cuba 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.590
 more which grow on the roof and a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.750
 once you cut the stem they will come to you 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.000
 being able to move by itself 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 now in the twilight continuation 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 first the normal ones of vats which 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 will have a variation giving towards 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 bag of vats 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.320
