00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello everyone we will talk today about foundations but how to choose 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.540
 its foundation in relation to its skin type compared to its complexion 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.389
 % to start with the color then the color of the foundation we chose 2 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.689
 always always the same color as his skin 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.339
 it was said scholar the euro confirms 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.719
 we never take relaxation above the risk finally first the stamp that 

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.210
 turn orange carrot is not very pretty 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.130
 and we never get too clear either because the state 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.990
 can become a little greyish this is particularly the case 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.890
 for skin that is very dark so morning or black so neither 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.980
 really careful you always have to take 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560
 the right color 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.010
 after to know for 100 th 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 what color suits us the best it really is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.390
 someone who is around you because we never stop to see each other 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.360
 correctly to know who is the type of skin meters 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 the true skin color yourself it takes someone to help us 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.150
 ask me for tips to send back that accompany you 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.160
 to make you try% at the beat level at the chin level for 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.030
 see 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.750
 if the color have declared themselves ready to sign a paper of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.920
 demarcation 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.730
 from the political moment demarcation 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 slightly in-row success much too dark 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.840
 a first shot the corresponding option 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.470
 even if you find that it makes you something mascate 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.829
 % that applies to america 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.039
 for them it will always be the case then to be able to wear it as the 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.540
 floating 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.380
 and would have southern time 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.990
 with six points in two windsor matches of sun 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.840
 in the game I tell them that really the chassis which of course has these points 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 because I have so many people who do not know what to choose 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.870
 face powder 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.190
 and that are getting way too dark for far too clear 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.320
 then we will talk% 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.180
 you he quotes why the first pass 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.960
 take back was central coming out spring pinault not matifying you 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.000
 be careful 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.140
 when you see in the picture he pulled back percent 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.810
 she did not take it easy when you have dry skin and she needs 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.000
 moisturizing cream moisturizer bazin 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 you take in addition a makeup base that will allow you to do 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.579
 hold and erase small flaws 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.950
 and take a foundation and moisturizer 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.160
 so in the blooming foundation to you have they give birth to examples 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.530
 to go away but what can he say he was killed and four 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.349
 runners who are things that happen 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.889
 who are not mattifying 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.199
 you will have 100% on average 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.099
 it is suitable for all skin types that leaves something very 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.249
 light and it's not something good the challenge is the mask 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.039
 of common naturalia 30 years 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.089
 % and it's very comfortable 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.269
 on the other hand it does not necessarily fit the program Saturday his 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.379
 lawyer stepped on me it does not fit 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.269
 like a hole 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.499
 contact a correspondent site% each possess 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:51.900
 you have the 8% wide note that she has one that is a light coverage to 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.889
 middle-aged risse bare skin 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.169
 killer was a time and so it is perfectly suited to the passage 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.809
 good after there is a multitude of other outside information 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.319
 interview 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 then for mixed skin she was caught 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.639
 you do not defend who you are maxisciences 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 a breathalyzer of a texture is the route that is in the form of 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.599
 powder 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.360
 for example you have in powder form the souletins among the races 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.559
 I have the range titien because that's what suited me djila 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.089
 why the ministry thanks 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.009
 % ytd powder foundation if you do not really like the team on the 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.669
 face everything very hot 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.320
 opt for painting 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.109
 it's not something very comfortable 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.299
 and especially very few means 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.899
 then this 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.629
 to hide among the races advantage is that we can motivate the coverage 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.749
 it goes something very light on your head running saber 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.710
 to something close the world of very current 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.660
 it may well hide the extra state I already tried that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.930
 works great so it's really a very very good background of 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.509
 dyed 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.679
 eric desisted the original range for dry skin 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.730
 and the matifying range 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.750
 for combination to oily skin more during the vote at its 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.899
 accomplices effect with minerals 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:07.529
 no preservatives can not list your builder buttons for the 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.109
 account of our title 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.040
 for foundation funds not shame 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.659
 for women chatter is able to 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.400
 on the way out she means what he would do with diarra 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 it is a mattifying foundation that is slightly covering too 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.710
 % and therefore know that all that is for the maintenance we will be a little more 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.120
 covering the liquid foundation liquid e for the poor for the most 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.629
 dry 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.969
 to say it what would make me laugh but in addition to such an extreme that 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.699
 will be holding all day 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 I tested we had a good performance against current level especially seek 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.030
 something very common 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.159
 it's not necessarily the ideal but it's a good foundation even if 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.849
 you also have when a fire extinguisher at that double or more ground to 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:50.629
 Earth 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.499
 the name not dubbed see this was full of normal glory that a 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.399
 texture the victim is titrated to understand who is really a very 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:58.590
 very good foundation 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.169
 with a trabant nt no one is wrong anyway even the back and did not let go of the 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.139
 bottle to show 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.090
 but so look for a very good foundation that camouflages them 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.659
 pigment spots pimples 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.869

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.050
 so my part the classes in the room 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.350

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.879
 extreme if you have scars dd hole - for tasks and pimples 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.729

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.800

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.409
 an agreement comes not we can 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.750

 that you hate% in kazan directly 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.830

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.830
 for that we are good it is that I have a little bit in the newspaper you have either 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.830
