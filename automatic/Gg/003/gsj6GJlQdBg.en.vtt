 process that they have their processor is 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.450
 nadal therefore also can do 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.400
 in a bowl with a fork are going to take 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 a little bit because now I have butter and

 frozen vegetable shortening ok 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.810
 and we are going to start putting it little by little 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.950
 the ingredients are appearing here 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.500
 They are going slowly 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 and I have the butter in pieces 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 frozen 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 we can see how it starts to form a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.170
 sandy mass 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.060
 ready to get frozen water 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.760
 apple they are thinking is formed there 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.560
 is the ball is beginning to gather 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.220
 all the ingredients start at 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.480
 integrate makes a good we are 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.840

 spatulas the blades up to our 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.560
 dough 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.020
 here it is there and it is more to what I am going to 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.330
 to do is put it with flour in the area 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.580
 running and half of the flour water by 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.120
 cross mold placed in the mold of the sea 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.370
 that we have in the house is 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.110
 perfectly we see it being 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.910
 perfectly and I lie here is 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.030
 put enough flour and here already 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.990
 we have the ball 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.510
 list 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.600
 this we are going to knead this gift 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.610
 heart also this theater takes but 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.610
 we knead very well here is 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.870
 let's form a disc is very 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.760
 important to form a disc I'm going to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.819
 say because if I leave it done one 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.689
 ball like the one I have here is not going to 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.139
 work we need it to be 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.849
 very well done the circle very well 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.549
 perfectly well kneaded then I'm going 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.319
 to put with her so that if in case of 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.700
 I'm going to use now or 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.099
 if I do not start lining my mold x what 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.540
 I will cover perfectly and the only 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:31.099
 I'm going to do is add anything plus 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.349
 mega for a plastic film above and 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.239
 I'm going to put it to refrigerate so that 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.950
 all the ingredients have again 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.169
 its same consistency that is the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.620
 of course butter and butter 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:45.530
 I have ready a dough a mass prince 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.860
 in my mold the only thing I have to do 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.860
 is to start applying 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.770
 because he stung her so they do not get hurt 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.080
 bubbles with cooking the dough tends to 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.390
 make bubbles and if I was not stung me 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.520
 they are going to make bubbles we need to make 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.080
 a cooking in blind cooking is diego 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.080
 is to put aluminum foil 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.300
 and so that bubbles are not made in case 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.200
 they come to do I have to put a 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.900
 weight the weight will be put enough 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.870
 Beans 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.310
 so that I'm not going to make a weight 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.250
 the nine of course pressed them 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.130
 and they go for ten minutes to the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.580

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.510
 It was the only thing I removed 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.250
 and the party in big sizes because 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.350
 because I do not want is also very very very 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.980
 because I do not care, I want to 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.660
 let me see that it is really from 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.540

 again the value is not exactly what 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.879
 to start very well 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:30.240
