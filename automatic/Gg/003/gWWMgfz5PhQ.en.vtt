00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 This car is a total blessing by the emperors Lee Myung Hun, 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.230
 I do not know about that British loser, but Robin Hood comes to know it. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.139
 Yes to Robin Hood John King's Tyrant John King's after Richard 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.650
 And Philly, especially the famous French words 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.220
 We are bourbons. Alter is rival to each other. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.600
 3 is continued because beoleojineunde intellectual and forgot it was gum leaving aside 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.730
 We fight and put Pat. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.360
 Yes, and so I do ugg But funny thing's 4th 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.450
 It's more of a history of Western Europe than it is the crusade itself . 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 20, it 's important to know that today's Euro 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.469
 Now it's one of those distinctive events that tell the history 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 The Fourth Crusade will be closed. 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.450
 So would have doubled the troops that most sex and drinking in those days times 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.450
 Italy's van matches 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.060
 Into the bath medium fits into this place called Wormwood Adriatic clusters 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.180
 There is 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.410
 Here, the Venetian vessels are contracted, so a year later the Crusaders 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.199
 Let's get together 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:09.250
 So let's give it a down payment At the time, Venetia was a big stone 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.700
 I was supposed to be the Republic of the time of cultivation wolf to help people 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.530
 It 's a quartz called porcelain . 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.060
 Yes, it's a Republic. It 's not a king. I want to be with that angel . No one . 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.259
 I'm a little off. 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.740
 No one but defense bastard, so the king did as different in that respect 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:30.759
 But he 's the one who's been over me. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.720
 D Don is a very fox- like person. 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.619
 He's a person. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.560
 I deal with the Crusaders that narcissism Phase 3 contracts of the Christian congregation 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.550
 I think we can get some idea why we got the contract. 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.250
 Anyway, give it a deposit agreement but also Can I not doing that half 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.509
 So I got the lock on. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.560
 The Crusaders do not know what to do with the soldiers gathered in Port yes they have 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:58.810
 Now it was a weak demo, so I have to go to the crusade. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.790
 Eunikka kit did not gather the money to do it for the retreat came to find for rent 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.630
 Venetian Bronze Foot 4 What we do not understand is that thousands of people 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:12.459
 Does it make sense that the army felt trapped in the harbor? 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:17.140
 I just went to the farm and the ship was cold-hearted. 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.860
 When the contract rather hard to cool anhapnida the circle trembled from fear 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.730
 So suppose there is only a stone I gals folded later that 4 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.050
 I'll take my orders. I'm writing a bet . Conquer the city â€‹â€‹of Songari. 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.380
 What I wanted to conquer was that I usually won the Venetian Dragon 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.080
 The Crusaders did not go to buy the Holy Land with Kyunghee University. 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.349
 Suggest city for service bully 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.400
 And when I was late I started to wander around Constantinople 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.120
 Here we make the Latin Empire 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.750
 Oh no meokyido the city 10 to 60 people and now we get out 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.239
 More safety is funny, but what we should pay attention to is Western 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.379
 It is an idea to contract in history 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:03:00.959
 I 've been thinking from a very long time ago . 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:03.450
 Through the mercenary. The Roman Empire keeps the change and the dragon. 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.069
 In the end, mercenaries are destroyed by revolt. 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.060
 I wasnt in Guangzhou City, President ah bottle not tell me the last time farmers 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.780
 Since inches because the concept of why all the people were injection was the guy 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.750
 I saw that the army is why Imperial is the central slip home 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.459
 I do not have mercenary concepts like that. 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.430
 Field ants Kyung wrote for the notion recruited from Roman times 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:31.109
 But our notion of this contract is hard to understand. 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.040
 Because one of the country politically, why in the East, especially from South Korea who 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.060
 That's it . 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.989
 Let's try Korean people through one legal system. This concept is very strong. 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.650
 I do not have the concept of a nation and a deal with what it is. 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.639
 In your resume, what's the longest time in 20 years? 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.120
 It is 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:51.930
 Eventually comical carefully so that you end the Crusades 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.269
 The Mongol Empire entered the same time, Mongolia is now succulent as the original Western Europe 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.989
 I go to a systematic organization 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.830
 Will receive hated going to the emperor of this society kids are enjoying the hospital 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.940
 Someday . 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.790
 Oh why contracts would still hundreds of people in the UK are just one acquaintance 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.380
 Do you have a famous e -Elizabeth? 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:15.390
 Elizabeth Francis Drake run now would give him incubation enjoy 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.820
 Magellan is working on six colors. I think she'll eventually come up. 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.470
 I think it's worth the investment 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.410
 The memorial for penalties so as to Sanya paragon like the fact that we tongilho 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.220
 Familiar places the concept of dynasty, people are so tasty 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.670
 The king does not have to make an investment. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.750
 But they have two kings. 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.630
 So I get some of the profits that come out of it. 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.180
 This is a European dynasty. 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.320
 I'll tell you about Columbus. 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.370
 The numbers are 2 by Isabel and 8 by Columbia a return of a 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:56.560
 I will sign the contract and leave the Atlantic Expedition. 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.270
 Oh the concept of history itself, that's a very strong party to introduce so 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.750
 Back to history 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.479
 Finally, through the Crusades, you realize that there are other times 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:10.090
 The other door will feel the presence of the law 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:12.580
 So the biggest history of document history is that of the greatest transformation 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.260
 How do you say it's a gift? 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.260
 What happens to these three things all at once? 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.940
 When I was in school, this was once found in my costume. 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.940
 I told you. 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.130
 However, the European- centered discovery itself is the European organization because it is now 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:32.020
 It was a time of anti- ship. 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:35.199
 And everybody's heard their office names that day. 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.699
 Next is the Reformation. 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.410
 From this time when it was modernized in Western Europe, six falsehoods were found in Western Europe 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.820
 A central history is developed 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.080
 The physical power of the East Asian society is much weaker than that of the used society. 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.380
 Starting 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.650
 From the European point of view, the era of world conquest begins. 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:58.419
 In the lending, spring is from the 14th century to the 16th century 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:01.090
 200 years. This is what happens with this. Now the branches are interlocking . 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.570
 What the Renaissance itself is 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.110
 Banks in the bank We have a lot of good artists 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.320
 Come out. 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:12.370
 Michelangelo, David, and Rafael. 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:17.560
 So what is the reason for 60 exercises here? 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.910
 North before when I was writing for the better only good punk Wang Roma back to sleep 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.659
 I said I would. 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.480
 Can I start it in the Holy Roman Empire, if I ate so far nameplate 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:29.230
 There is only one offering on the top. 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:34.090
 Oh, this is the first time the Napoleon company of the 19th century has closed down for the first time. 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:37.720
 That is far south as Germany and Austria, this is how you look is not Germany 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:41.290
 The area can be called sacred and territory. 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:45.310
 In this empire and the Alps and within the Pope 0 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:49.570
 Central cities in China 10 cities between the cities are communism 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:53.380
 There 's a gap in power . Brother Far North to the south. 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:56.590
 2 Copies of the relationship Puppet and emperor are in each city, fighting against each other 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.850
 But it's very developed with water economy . 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.430
 I want to stop it from moving. I do not want to lose to three. 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.000
 Because trade is the only one here. 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:10.630
 There are spices and silk ceramics in Dongbang Trading. 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.370
 Spice silk ceramics come from Def China or Southeast Asia to Syria 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.670
 Coming overland 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.450
 And the role that Italian merchants carry on their way here by land 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.290
 I will 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:24.370
 It's a lot of money here . 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:26.090
 I will pay a lot of money this is the economic economic 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.860
 The code is 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:35.540
 So yesulron further inquiries and religious revival movement that forces the weak jijyo 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.750
 This weakens the power of the church getting it through the Crusades, not the church books 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.960
 As the civilization is discovered, only the church becomes weaker 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.310
 Where humans are now responsible for the life of his individualistic ideas 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.100
 It starts to spring up. 

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:53.450
 This is a Renaissance humanism and Jesus movement. 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:58.220
 The era of Korea has been opened. 

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:59.419
 However, the ascendant is a merchant from the cities of Northern Italy 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.020
 Give me some food . 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:06.680
 Starting from Venice to Pisa from Florence. 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.330
 So here I'm glad it happened detail Lin to join the passport-free here 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.669
 I can not style it 

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.669
 I told you about it in Spain .
