Bugatti and in forza motorsport two we
approached<00:00:33.860> Bugatti<00:00:34.250> again<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.239> at<00:00:35.329> that

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
approached Bugatti again but at that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.970 
approached Bugatti again but at that
time<00:00:35.510> Bugatti<00:00:36.110> wasn't<00:00:36.440> really<00:00:36.590> interested<00:00:36.739> in

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
time Bugatti wasn't really interested in

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.400 
time Bugatti wasn't really interested in
being<00:00:37.160> in<00:00:37.340> video<00:00:37.610> games<00:00:37.879> but<00:00:38.230> video<00:00:39.230> games

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
being in video games but video games

today<00:00:39.650> have<00:00:39.920> broadened<00:00:40.190> out<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.760> they're

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
today have broadened out and they're

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.640 
today have broadened out and they're
actually<00:00:40.970> part<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.449> mass<00:00:41.660> media<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.500> think

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
actually part of mass media so I think

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.619 
actually part of mass media so I think
that's<00:00:42.949> opened<00:00:43.489> up<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.790> door<00:00:43.970> for<00:00:44.000> us<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.480> do

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
that's opened up the door for us to do
