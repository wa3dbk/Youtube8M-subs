 7 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.180

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.920
 concept 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.020
 then from this concept 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.670
 it is arrived begins to be what the elaboration of the facts 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.710
 Once the elaboration of sketches is finished, the last step is three 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.520
 unprotected citizens 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.530
 - what is ergonomic studies 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.290
 per hundred what is reaches 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.510
 then the end user 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 has the ability to feel comfortable in all countries there are some that 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.900
 have to develop properly in all the saga that has my lady 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 in the trial I was presenting illustration works 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.200
 which is corporate image plus graphic production li had let them 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 in the final exams are made up of juries of professors 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.760
 and they are the ones who define and who brought the most complete ones are valued 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.320
 are those that finally in Granada the exhibition 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.260
 menezes later on how it should be from a teenager different kind of 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.130
 I do not work like 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.200
 there were facilities cultures natural study 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.790
 and through him 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.180
 in these studies is carried out other more 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.270
 aptra the insured do without distinction assign exceptions 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.089
 for example the installation process where 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.399
 the moon or state various elements that smuggling

 I wanted to create a pension of the world but and of the photos of his hobby 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.949
 do not 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.389
 and the one that had generated this kind of universe evidence does not clarify the 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:31.239
 composition looking for where to put it object when always with the emptiness 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.109
 in a space 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.259
 create a tour in the space visual tour by a feeling 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.489
 this session doing to all the students because 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.459
 we open the law is badly mounted on the people who come to visit 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.950
 they ask that it is a very innovative career 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.260
 that requires a lot of effort on the part of the students 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.030
 good to start we spread a lot of work and everything we do during 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 every year, do not remain anonymous 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.630
 says one was also in work camps people always come 50 data 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.530
 interesting being aware and instead scene totally is a pride h 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.549
 expose to fall at work is very satisfying
