00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.679
 who runs the country 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.070
 When you read this, I'll already be very far away from Coconut House 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.679
 I will not receive 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.730
 and that's one of the reasons why I'm leaving 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.890
 you do not seem to understand 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.710
 and the most important thing I want to say is that you remember that piece that 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 attentively 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.430
 the activity at the beginning of the year 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 very cleverly breaks 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 32 as the outbreak 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.220
 with some detainee 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.750
 you can go back to 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.949
 min 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.949
 in love as criminals 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.530
 I change you 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 for nobody was an accountant 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 but just like the olive grove that 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 can be converted before this camera 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520
 another way in which in the tapes like loves 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.430
 that not so much 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 is that sometimes it costs from the oak 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 these tons and tons 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.600
 the aguilarense once again and again 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 once and Again 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.220
 a man 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.190
 they all think they have a blank paper but to the points with the president of 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.920
 the anb all 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 AndrÃ© Silva 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.059
 Murray and I miss you and we want that group to come back 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 but the condition 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.839
 I will not kill he gave 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.760
 not only to them 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.869
 I do not plan to leave it and the television 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.999
 I like the group but I'm not going to leave coca I do not care if that's the way it is 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.699
 I do not think we can make wales 2 0 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.279
 the aforementioned group 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.279
 I choose coconut 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.239
 everything I was sure that that group chose 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.349
 I do not stay with coconut 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 I guess now it can be 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.109
 good alone 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.109
 see you in the sector 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.739
 better hope that for the bus and then 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.439
 the steering wheel 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.439
 until now 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.099
 mid morning today 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.269
 I got up in the middle of the morning 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.790
 rosemary now the girl on the scoreboard supported the measure that yesterday morning 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.790
 about this epidemic of dengue 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.230
 missions have 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.829
 fashion trends 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.829
 and I think it's the umpteenth hand 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 valverde pretext granting 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.239
 also the 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.589
 both were both 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.430
 the truth 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.430
 everyone 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.419
 also for the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.469
 - The airline 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:19.590
 but at two 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.269
 until now the crisis 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.460
 Germany 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.809
