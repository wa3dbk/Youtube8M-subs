00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 now I will show you how to knit 2 semi-columns 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.510
 sc with a common vertex two loops case 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.240
 I will continue to rise in the next 2 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.199
 knit loops 2 double crochet with 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 I go to the top of the common top 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.460
 injecting ie first loop 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 grabbing a worker on the hook 3 loops 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 leave them unattached 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.080
 doing 1 coat and going to the second loop 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 previous row grabbing a working thread 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 I have 5 loops on the hook 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.540
 grabbing a working thread and tying it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.690
 all five loops are 2 semi-columns with 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.790
 nakida with a common top again nakid food 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.059
 in the first loop I grab a working thread 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.850
 I pull the loop on the hook 3 loops again 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.539
 nakid in the second loop capture worker 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 thread and also pull the loop on the hook 5 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.620
 loops knitting all five loops at once 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.989
 can be knit and more 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 double crochet semi-columns with a common vertex 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.049
 for example, I will tie 3 semi-columns with 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.840
 nakida with a common top nakida in first 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.810
 loop the loop stretched captured them not 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.720
 we knit again in the next 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.570
 the loop just as well pulled another 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.509
 loop and into the next loop for sure 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.020
 show captured working thread and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.180
 I knit all the loops on the hook at once 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:32.090
 there will be a little bit complicated 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.090
 that loops a lot with nakidami so 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.820
 so here's the way to do next 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.260
 again the next loop has faded yet another 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.270
 nape the next loop and another 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.890
 loop grab working thread and 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.590
 I knit all the loops on the hook, that is 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.590
 so i'm doing a decrease I repeat 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:11.320
 again I knit 2 semi-columns with 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:14.800
 nakida with a common top for example 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.380
 it is clear that it is possible and 3 and 4 and 5 like 5 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.540
 there will be very much too 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.550
 in this way are done most often 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.540
 subtraction either in any patterns 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.540
 apply
