00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.470 
exactly what this guy me tells it has a
board<00:03:52.170> at<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> back<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.150> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
board at the back and this is to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.750 
board at the back and this is to
construct<00:03:54.990> it<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.920> removed<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.550> board

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
construct it so you removed the board

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.060 
construct it so you removed the board
now<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.240> board<00:03:57.600> does<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:58.110> numbers<00:03:58.740> on<00:03:58.770> the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
now the board does have numbers on the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.520 
now the board does have numbers on the
back<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.460> it<00:03:59.520> shows<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.000> where<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.900> place<00:04:01.080> all

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
back and it shows you where to place all

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.410 
back and it shows you where to place all
the<00:04:02.070> bricks<00:04:02.520> as<00:04:02.730> well<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.060> gives<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.300> an

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
the bricks as well it gives you an

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.970 
the bricks as well it gives you an
outline<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.080> nose<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> eye<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
outline of the nose and the eye so you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.280 
outline of the nose and the eye so you
know<00:04:05.190> exactly<00:04:05.600> where<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.750> need<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.020> put<00:04:07.200> the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
know exactly where you need to put the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.960 
know exactly where you need to put the
bricks<00:04:07.530> now<00:04:07.680> these<00:04:07.860> numbers<00:04:08.340> he<00:04:08.460> doesn't<00:04:08.790> say

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
bricks now these numbers he doesn't say

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.730 
bricks now these numbers he doesn't say
whether<00:04:09.180> these<00:04:09.390> are<00:04:09.690> points<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.440> score

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
whether these are points that you score

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.580 
whether these are points that you score
but<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:12.000> would<00:04:12.120> assume<00:04:12.240> that<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.380> knock

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
but I would assume that if you knock

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.249 
but I would assume that if you knock
that<00:04:13.920> block<00:04:14.160> out<00:04:14.370> it's<00:04:14.910> 14<00:04:15.420> points<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.109> you're

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
that block out it's 14 points and you're

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.680 
that block out it's 14 points and you're
not<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:16.829> is<00:04:17.010> two<00:04:17.250> points<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:18.359> it

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
not that one out is two points but it

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.360 
not that one out is two points but it
doesn't<00:04:19.019> actually<00:04:19.290> say<00:04:19.980> so

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
doesn't actually say so

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.820 
doesn't actually say so
you<00:04:21.000> can<00:04:21.209> use<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.510> as<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> point<00:04:21.959> system<00:04:22.230> or<00:04:22.650> just

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
you can use it as a point system or just

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.340 
you can use it as a point system or just
use<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.250> point<00:04:23.460> system<00:04:23.700> given<00:04:24.690> in

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
use the point system given in

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.530 
use the point system given in
that<00:04:25.710> manual<00:04:26.190> but<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.670> Caicos<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.330> do

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
that manual but this is Caicos you do

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.780 
that manual but this is Caicos you do
need<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.900> build<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.620> best<00:04:28.890> star<00:04:29.130> on<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.550> and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
need to build the best star on this and

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.570 
need to build the best star on this and
then<00:04:30.210> place<00:04:30.480> it<00:04:30.750> into<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.320> stand<00:04:31.740> take<00:04:32.460> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
then place it into the stand take the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.820 
then place it into the stand take the
board<00:04:32.790> away<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:34.080> you're<00:04:34.260> ready<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.620> play
