00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
only thing that I might do coming up

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.260 
only thing that I might do coming up
because<00:02:20.800> when<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.010> built<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.370> well<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.120> had

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
because when I built this well we had

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.120 
because when I built this well we had
our<00:02:22.300> hydraulic<00:02:22.870> top<00:02:23.020> end<00:02:23.260> though<00:02:23.410> for<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
our hydraulic top end though for the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.250 
our hydraulic top end though for the
shovels<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.700> am<00:02:25.360> running<00:02:25.510> hydraulics<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.140> this

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
shovels I am running hydraulics in this

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.410 
shovels I am running hydraulics in this
but<00:02:26.500> before<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.100> had<00:02:27.250> our<00:02:27.400> our<00:02:27.760> hydraulics<00:02:28.270> out

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
but before we had our our hydraulics out

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.710 
but before we had our our hydraulics out
so<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> may<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.230> may<00:02:30.190> take<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.490> 514<00:02:31.150> cam<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
so I may I may take the 514 cam out and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.620 
so I may I may take the 514 cam out and
go<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.990> 585<00:02:32.590> are<00:02:32.890> our<00:02:33.610> tap<00:02:33.850> that's<00:02:34.030> kept<00:02:34.420> um

go to a 585 are our tap that's kept um

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.060 
go to a 585 are our tap that's kept um
I'm<00:02:35.020> not<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> real<00:02:35.440> rough<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.770> do<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:35.980> because

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070
