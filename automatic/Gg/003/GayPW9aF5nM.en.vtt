00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
model was launched in Europe and so the

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:47.869

is it going to be like I mean do we know
anything<00:01:21.810> about<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> smartphone<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> how

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
anything about the smartphone and how

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
anything about the smartphone and how
it's<00:01:23.430> different<00:01:23.609> from<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> three<00:01:24.359> right<00:01:24.810> well

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
it's different from the three right well

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.899 
it's different from the three right well
Samsung's<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:25.950> tight-lipped<00:01:26.219> about<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
Samsung's very tight-lipped about the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.249 
Samsung's very tight-lipped about the
major<00:01:27.090> specs<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> new<00:01:27.990> high-end

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
major specs of this new high-end

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.679 
major specs of this new high-end
smartphone<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.490> industry<00:01:30.210> watchers<00:01:30.509> are

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
smartphone but industry watchers are

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
smartphone but industry watchers are
saying<00:01:30.929> that<00:01:31.109> it's<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.530> terms<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.859> hardware<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
saying that it's in terms of hardware it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
saying that it's in terms of hardware it
will<00:01:32.850> likely<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> bigger<00:01:33.630> 5-inch<00:01:34.320> screen

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
will likely be a bigger 5-inch screen

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.349 
will likely be a bigger 5-inch screen
and<00:01:34.979> they'll<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.310> using<00:01:35.340> OLED<00:01:36.119> technology

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
and they'll be using OLED technology

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.419 
and they'll be using OLED technology
which<00:01:37.020> allows<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.829> screens<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> be

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
which allows these screens to be

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.940 
which allows these screens to be
brighter<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.270> energy<00:01:39.659> efficient<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
brighter and more energy efficient it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859 
brighter and more energy efficient it
should<00:01:41.219> be<00:01:41.250> thinner<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.969> lighter<00:01:42.149> probably

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
should be thinner and lighter probably

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.169 
should be thinner and lighter probably
it'll<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.499> a<00:01:43.530> faster<00:01:44.070> processor<00:01:44.969> which

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
it'll have a faster processor which

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.569 
it'll have a faster processor which

of the big changes I've seen what

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.980 
of the big changes I've seen what
Samsung<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.460> last<00:02:32.670> few<00:02:32.910> years<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.360> really

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
Samsung in the last few years is really

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.390 
Samsung in the last few years is really
working<00:02:34.290> towards<00:02:34.800> beefing<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.250> their

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
working towards beefing up their

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.030 
working towards beefing up their
software<00:02:35.900> capabilities<00:02:36.900> there<00:02:37.530> are<00:02:37.740> they've

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
software capabilities there are they've

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.830 
software capabilities there are they've
been<00:02:38.070> manufacturing<00:02:38.880> forms<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.630> over

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
been manufacturing forms for like over

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.350 
been manufacturing forms for like over
15<00:02:40.740> years<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.970> their<00:02:42.210> real

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
15 years and so that is their real

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.030 
15 years and so that is their real
strength<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.020> reason<00:02:43.230> why<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.920> they

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
strength but the reason why that they

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.160 
strength but the reason why that they
haven't<00:02:44.220> been<00:02:44.430> able<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.730> gain<00:02:44.940> an<00:02:45.810> upper<00:02:45.990> hand

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
haven't been able to gain an upper hand

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.900 
haven't been able to gain an upper hand
in<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.530> market<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.250> because<00:02:47.760> they

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
in this market is really because they

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.820 
in this market is really because they
haven't<00:02:48.090> been<00:02:48.330> able<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:48.930> much<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.680> their
