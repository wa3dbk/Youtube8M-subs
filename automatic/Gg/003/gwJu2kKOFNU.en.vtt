we propagate blessed and Musa lots of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
we propagate blessed and Musa lots of
times<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.680> single<00:00:50.070> polyps<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
times into single polyps because of the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.020 
times into single polyps because of the
way<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> coral<00:00:51.629> grows<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> single<00:00:53.460> polyp<00:00:53.760> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
way the coral grows the single polyp can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
way the coral grows the single polyp can
produce<00:00:54.270> multiple<00:00:54.629> heads<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> base<00:00:55.710> of

produce multiple heads at the base of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
produce multiple heads at the base of
the<00:00:56.100> coral<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:57.000> single<00:00:57.360> polyp<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.079> quickly

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the coral so a single polyp can quickly

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
the coral so a single polyp can quickly
turn<00:00:58.620> into<00:00:58.680> seven<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.280> eight<00:01:00.890> like<00:01:01.890> many<00:01:02.160> other

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
turn into seven or eight like many other
