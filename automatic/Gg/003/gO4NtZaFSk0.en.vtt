this such as a price or cost ER or even

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.049 
this such as a price or cost ER or even
the<00:00:57.329> release<00:00:57.719> date<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:57.989> these<00:00:58.320> sets<00:00:58.760> but<00:00:59.760> it's

think that's safe to assume but once
again<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.489> never<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.210> too<00:01:06.510> much
