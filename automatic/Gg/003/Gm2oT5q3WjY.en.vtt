show you how to do in this video now
this<00:00:26.580> little<00:00:26.849> trick<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.449> called<00:00:27.840> mick<00:00:28.380> trained

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
this little trick is called mick trained

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.919 
this little trick is called mick trained
basically<00:00:29.130> metabolic<00:00:29.970> training<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
basically metabolic training and it's a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.299 
basically metabolic training and it's a
little<00:00:31.140> way<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.260> make<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:31.710> workouts<00:00:32.040> more

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
metabolically active and this is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.630 
metabolically active and this is
something<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> learned<00:00:35.130> from<00:00:35.280> coach

stuff anyway the core purpose of this
whole<00:01:01.440> metabolic<00:01:02.039> training<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.239> increase

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
whole metabolic training is to increase

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.920 
whole metabolic training is to increase
the<00:01:04.199> calorie<00:01:04.650> burning<00:01:04.949> increase<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.090> oxygen

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the calorie burning increase the oxygen

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.410 
the calorie burning increase the oxygen
and<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.189> work<00:01:08.460> done<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> same

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and just get more work done for the same

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
and just get more work done for the same
amount<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> time<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> gym<00:01:10.530> so

their arms all pumped up and things like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
their arms all pumped up and things like
that<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> very

the<00:01:21.150> most<00:01:21.360> metabolic<00:01:21.930> active<00:01:22.740> muscle<00:01:23.130> when

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the most metabolic active muscle when

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.030 
the most metabolic active muscle when
you<00:01:23.910> do<00:01:24.000> remem<00:01:24.330> exercises<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.410> doesn't<00:01:25.920> create

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you do remem exercises it doesn't create

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.070 
you do remem exercises it doesn't create
a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> oxygen<00:01:26.640> dead<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.750> don't<00:01:27.780> burn

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a lot of oxygen dead and you don't burn

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.860 
a lot of oxygen dead and you don't burn
a<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> calories<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:29.040> mean<00:01:29.460> compared<00:01:29.880> advice

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
a lot of calories I mean compared advice

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.650 
a lot of calories I mean compared advice
it<00:01:31.080> curls<00:01:31.410> Tuesday<00:01:32.010> barbell<00:01:32.430> squats<00:01:32.730> you<00:01:33.480> can

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
it curls Tuesday barbell squats you can

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.600 
it curls Tuesday barbell squats you can
rip<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> failure<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.620> curls<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
rip up the failure with curls and you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
rip up the failure with curls and you
can<00:01:35.730> feel<00:01:35.880> fine<00:01:36.120> afterwards<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:37.080> rep<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.440> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
can feel fine afterwards you rep up the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.110 
can feel fine afterwards you rep up the
failure<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.100> squats<00:01:38.400> we're<00:01:38.760> gonna<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
failure with squats we're gonna be

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.400 
failure with squats we're gonna be
gasping<00:01:39.660> for<00:01:39.900> air

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
gasping for air

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.780 
gasping for air
I<00:01:40.440> mean<00:01:40.800> squats<00:01:41.160> are<00:01:41.340> much<00:01:41.550> more

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
I mean squats are much more

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.510 
I mean squats are much more
metabolically<00:01:42.480> active<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.250> trick

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
metabolically active but a little trick

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
metabolically active but a little trick

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you can do is to incorporate some leg

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
you can do is to incorporate some leg
exercises<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.150> between<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.810> sets<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.260> your

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
exercises in between the sets of your

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.930 

all<00:03:10.050> right<00:03:10.200> without<00:03:10.530> any<00:03:10.950> rest<00:03:11.250> where<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.820> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
all right without any rest where this is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.010 
all right without any rest where this is
kind<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.360> be<00:03:12.420> my<00:03:12.540> rest<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:12.930> my

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.750 

so<00:03:28.700> America<00:03:29.269> arrested<00:03:30.099> I'm<00:03:31.099> still<00:03:31.400> getting

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
so America arrested I'm still getting

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.050 
so America arrested I'm still getting
some<00:03:32.530> activity<00:03:34.390> increasing<00:03:35.390> oxygen<00:03:35.599> dip

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
some activity increasing oxygen dip

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.500 
some activity increasing oxygen dip
burning<00:03:38.060> more<00:03:38.180> towers<00:03:40.000> go<00:03:41.000> back<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.299> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
burning more towers go back to the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:04:01.910 
burning more towers go back to the
direction

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.490 

so<00:04:02.920> there<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.280> go<00:04:03.430> that's<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.940> sample<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.569> mech

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
so there you go that's a sample of mech

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.070 
so there you go that's a sample of mech

like to get the full meal do the full
version<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.080> mint<00:04:38.500> training<00:04:38.889> then<00:04:39.370> what<00:04:39.550> I

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
version of mint training then what I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.280 
version of mint training then what I
suggest<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.120> do<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.479> pick<00:04:40.690> up<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:40.930> copy<00:04:41.169> of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
is a walking encyclopedia for this stuff

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600 
is a walking encyclopedia for this stuff
he's<00:04:49.900> been<00:04:50.169> around<00:04:50.470> for<00:04:50.860> years<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.490> he's
