00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
complaining on the way he looks this

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.610 
complaining on the way he looks this
isn't<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.630> big<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:33.930> boiler<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.470> he

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
isn't that big with boiler but he

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.380 
isn't that big with boiler but he
doesn't<00:02:34.980> end<00:02:35.190> up<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.910> he

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
doesn't end up look like that he

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.910 
doesn't end up look like that he
actually<00:02:36.690> at<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.989> enemy<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.800> he

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
actually at the enemy we see that he

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
actually at the enemy we see that he
kind<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> heels<00:02:38.580> from<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.030> green<00:02:39.209> golem<00:02:39.540> serum

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
kind of heels from the green golem serum

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.500 
kind of heels from the green golem serum
he<00:02:40.019> looked<00:02:40.200> kind<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.500> normal<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.459> i'm<00:02:41.940> guessing

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
he looked kind of normal so i'm guessing

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.790 
he looked kind of normal so i'm guessing
they<00:02:42.780> did<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.110> because<00:02:43.200> people<00:02:43.319> didn't<00:02:43.769> like

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
they did that because people didn't like

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.740 
they did that because people didn't like
the<00:02:44.220> reaction<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:44.910> were<00:02:44.970> getting<00:02:45.239> when<00:02:45.569> they

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
the reaction they were getting when they

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.120 
the reaction they were getting when they
heard<00:02:46.049> like<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> know<00:02:46.620> what<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> Green

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130

Goblin<00:02:47.630> either<00:02:48.630> way<00:02:48.780> he<00:02:48.959> doesn't<00:02:49.140> really<00:02:49.260> look

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
Goblin either way he doesn't really look

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.140 
Goblin either way he doesn't really look
the<00:02:49.470> same<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:49.769> with<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.190> villains<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.790> say<00:02:51.000> it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the same so with the villains I say it's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.259 
the same so with the villains I say it's
pretty<00:02:51.330> good<00:02:51.480> spider-man<00:02:52.350> himself<00:02:53.269> one

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
problem I had was I hope there's a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.430 
problem I had was I hope there's a
little<00:02:55.920> bit<00:02:56.100> too<00:02:56.370> much<00:02:56.720> him<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.870> Gwen<00:02:58.080> Stacy

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
little bit too much him in Gwen Stacy

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.320 
little bit too much him in Gwen Stacy
