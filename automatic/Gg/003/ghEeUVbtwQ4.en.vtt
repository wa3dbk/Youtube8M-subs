femme<00:01:48.630> fatale<00:01:49.110> look<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.579> all<00:01:50.880> about

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
femme fatale look I know it's all about

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.380

framing<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.350> face<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.640> eyes<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
framing your face with your eyes and I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
framing your face with your eyes and I
think<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> brows<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.470> first<00:01:55.799> place<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
think the brows are the first place to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
think the brows are the first place to
start<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.450> why<00:01:57.659> they<00:01:57.840> need<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
start with it that's why they need a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380 
start with it that's why they need a
good<00:01:58.500> wax<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.159> make<00:01:59.310> sure<00:01:59.490> everything's<00:02:00.119> in
