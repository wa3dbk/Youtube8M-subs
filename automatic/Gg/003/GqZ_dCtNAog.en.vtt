00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
check home about $71 and that's a lot of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.759 
check home about $71 and that's a lot of
money<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.300> charger<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
money for this charger and I was a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
money for this charger and I was a
little<00:00:23.070> hesitant<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.640> getting<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.210> but

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
little hesitant about getting it but

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
little hesitant about getting it but
then<00:00:25.140> i<00:00:25.170> remembered<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.970> most<00:00:26.970> phones

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
then i remembered that most phones

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.529 
then i remembered that most phones
coming<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.349> 2013<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.400> gonna<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.820> enabled

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
coming out in 2013 are gonna be enabled

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.540 
coming out in 2013 are gonna be enabled
so<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.170> able<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.650> wireless<00:00:32.279> charge

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
so you will be able to wireless charge

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.970 
so you will be able to wireless charge
it<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.660> hopefully<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> near<00:00:34.530> future<00:00:34.590> when

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it so hopefully in the near future when

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.490 
it so hopefully in the near future when
i<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.160> next<00:00:35.430> phone<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.960> compatible

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
i get next phone it would be compatible

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
i get next phone it would be compatible
with<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.739> charger<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.149> is

this<00:00:52.020> charger<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> looks<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this charger but to me it looks like a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.090 
this charger but to me it looks like a
touchstone<00:00:53.989> charger<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> palm<00:00:55.620> big

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.779 
touchstone charger from the palm big
palm<00:00:56.520> devices<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.399> actually<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
palm devices and actually have one of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
palm devices and actually have one of
those<00:00:59.879> touchstone<00:01:00.390> chargers<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.949> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
those touchstone chargers for this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.380 
those touchstone chargers for this
device<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.640> apollon<00:01:03.480> pixie<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
device right here apollon pixie and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.990 
device right here apollon pixie and
usually<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.000> any

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
usually you just put it on like that any

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.170 
usually you just put it on like that any
charges<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> magnetic<00:01:10.740> charger

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
charges and that was a magnetic charger

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.490 
charges and that was a magnetic charger
that<00:01:12.180> her<00:01:12.330> son<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> magnetic<00:01:13.170> charger

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that her son was the magnetic charger

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.690 
that her son was the magnetic charger
this<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> friction<00:01:14.520> big<00:01:14.700> charger<00:01:15.229> so

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
this one is a friction big charger so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
this one is a friction big charger so
basically<00:01:17.700> since<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> nexus<00:01:18.600> 4<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.380> made<00:01:19.740> out

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
basically since the nexus 4 is made out

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.160 
basically since the nexus 4 is made out
of<00:01:19.890> glass<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> rubber

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
of glass so when you put on the rubber

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.460 
of glass so when you put on the rubber
rubbery<00:01:22.860> texture<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.790> doesn't<00:01:24.409> move<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
rubbery texture it doesn't move that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.969 
rubbery texture it doesn't move that
much<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:29.130> friction<00:01:29.490> base<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.970> magnetic

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
much so it's friction base not magnetic

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
much so it's friction base not magnetic
one<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
one thing to know is that this is a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.100 
one thing to know is that this is a
mistake<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.189> made<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.670> went<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> opened<00:01:36.780> the

mistake I made I went when I opened the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590

charger i came with and i noticed the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.899 
charger i came with and i noticed the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
phone will take really really long to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
phone will take really really long to
charge<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> hell<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.770> on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so when I saw that sounds like I decided

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
so when I saw that sounds like I decided
to<00:01:58.710> open<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> charger<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.820> came<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to open this charger that came with the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.950 
to open this charger that came with the
the<00:02:01.110> arm<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> charging<00:02:02.579> dock<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.750> saw

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the arm at the charging dock and I saw

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
the arm at the charging dock and I saw
that<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> charger<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> little<00:02:05.100> bit<00:02:05.219> bigger

you<00:02:15.459> use<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.790> right<00:02:15.970> charger<00:02:16.239> for<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.510> right

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
you use the right charger for the right

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.860 
you use the right charger for the right
device<00:02:17.290> our<00:02:17.860> product<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.420> won't<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.750> in

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
device our product so you won't get in

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.080 
device our product so you won't get in
problems<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:21.340> package<00:02:21.550> says<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.970> takes

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
problems and the package says it takes

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.440 
problems and the package says it takes
about<00:02:22.390> four<00:02:22.900> hours<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.410> charge<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> believe

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
about four hours to charge so I believe

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
about four hours to charge so I believe
that<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.720> longer<00:02:25.959> than<00:02:26.200> plugging<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.129> your

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
that is longer than plugging in your

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.850 
that is longer than plugging in your
device<00:02:27.610> but<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.470> doesn't<00:02:29.650> really

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
device but to me it doesn't really

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.350 
device but to me it doesn't really
matter<00:02:30.069> because<00:02:30.280> i<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.640> find<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.120> cool<00:02:31.330> i

and I think it's because of the screen
being<00:03:41.350> on<00:03:42.480> may<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:43.690> increased<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.950> heat

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299
