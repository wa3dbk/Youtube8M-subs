00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.710
 Now that we have all the points on the needle, we have to start 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.400
 close we do not turn the fabric 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.980
 then we take shot the first one we always leave alone 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.320
 we can take ideas about the needle and we already passed two points together 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.029
 we took a hundred and passed two points together 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.419
 and so of to two points next to serrano the whole turn 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.749
 can be to urge the amount of points we think put 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 we always take edge and close two together 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 then this is the closing round 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 in the Tunisian we are always going to have a one-way flight where we assemble the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 points and a closing loop 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 where we all close as if we finished 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.340
 and there we have the closing lap list with a point only put in the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.990
 now we raise the points again but from now on the needle 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.340
 go through the vertical sticks that were formed 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.600
 then the first stick not because we have it from the previous turn 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.850
 this second taquito that each turn we pass the sheet 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.039
 tonalÃ¡ sky 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.480
 and there we passed the point that we are going to weave 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.140
 we go through the stick and leave the next point days and again 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.460
 then in the idaho round we must advance all the points on the needle 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.820
 but from now on passing it through the vertical stick that was formed 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.510
 and now that we have all the points put we close again 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.340
 the first one only 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.200
 and the others 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220
 and so on all the accounts despite the long we want 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.580
 and in 3d to two points together 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.670
 and so we are staying 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.460
 our new round always the last round will be like more boring 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.870
 than the previous 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.020
 but when we do the next round they all fit together 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.150
 then we already have the points together closing all the eu 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.800
 We stop to try a variant 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.480
 this variant 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.909
 in the turn 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.529
 outward 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.129
 it's a cross point 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.559
 instead of taking the first stick as it belongs to us we take the second 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.739
 a variant that cross point 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.489
 instead of taking the stick that corresponds to us the alters we went to 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.319
 next stick 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.599
 lopez not and now if we go back to the previous stick I do not know 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.289
 and then gone knitting and it will cost us we will have a common point 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.319
 the x 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
 again to the team to do stick we go to the next 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
 iara we weave the one that does not jump 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.979
 then all this turn first the second 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.979
 and then the previous one 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.489
 and on the second stick 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.489
 we already return there are people 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.889
 and so 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.129
 until completing the round
