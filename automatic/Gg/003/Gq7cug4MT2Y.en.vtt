hey guys expert here and today i am

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.720 
hey guys expert here and today i am
bringing<00:00:09.270> you<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.960> polar<00:00:10.410> opposites<00:00:11.130> crystal

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
bringing you a polar opposites crystal

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.199 
bringing you a polar opposites crystal
opening<00:00:12.480> yes<00:00:13.260> that<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.709> right<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:15.000> gone

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
opening yes that is right I have gone

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.450 
opening yes that is right I have gone
ahead<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.900> purchased<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.740> polar

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
ahead and I have purchased some polar

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.090 
ahead and I have purchased some polar
opposite<00:00:18.030> crystals<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.289> let's<00:00:19.530> go<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.860> into

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
opposite crystals so let's go up into

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790 
opposite crystals so let's go up into
crystal<00:00:20.550> head<00:00:20.700> I<00:00:21.080> need<00:00:22.080> two<00:00:22.260> hands<00:00:22.530> were<00:00:22.650> that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
crystal head I need two hands were that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.930 
crystal head I need two hands were that
had<00:00:22.920> 10<00:00:23.600> polar<00:00:24.600> opposite<00:00:25.110> crystals<00:00:25.530> now<00:00:26.070> I've

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
had 10 polar opposite crystals now I've

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.150 
had 10 polar opposite crystals now I've
been<00:00:27.240> told<00:00:27.480> by<00:00:28.850> Forrester<00:00:29.850> legend<00:00:30.890> Alan<00:00:31.890> pack

you got 13 4 stars in one week 13 4
stars<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.480> week<00:00:55.489> just<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.969> let<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
stars in one week just just let that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.170 
stars in one week just just let that
sink<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.839> bit<00:00:59.390> 13like<00:01:02.719> come<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.809> man<00:01:05.150> give<00:01:06.150> me

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
sink in a bit 13like come on man give me

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.889 
sink in a bit 13like come on man give me
some<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.659> come<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.110> um<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> because

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
some of those come on um so because

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.149 
some of those come on um so because
that's<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:10.200> case<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.829> to<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.130> ahead

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that's the case I'm going to go ahead

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.440 
that's the case I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:11.850> open<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.329> my

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and I'm going to also open up my

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.109 
and I'm going to also open up my
fearless<00:01:13.079> crystal<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:14.219> so<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> one

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
fearless crystal just so we can get one

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.740 
fearless crystal just so we can get one
crystal<00:01:15.600> spin<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.119> love<00:01:18.119> spinning<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.570> least

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
crystal spin in I love spinning at least

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.819 
crystal spin in I love spinning at least
one<00:01:19.079> crystal<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> guys<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> pretend<00:01:22.649> this

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
one crystal for you guys so pretend this

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.429 
one crystal for you guys so pretend this
fearless<00:01:23.250> crystal<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.960> polar<00:01:24.960> opposite

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
fearless crystal is a polar opposite

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.510 
fearless crystal is a polar opposite
crystal<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.700> let's<00:01:27.299> drop<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480 

so<00:01:33.149> polar<00:01:33.780> opposite<00:01:34.170> crystals<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.979> contain

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
so polar opposite crystals they contain

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.740 
so polar opposite crystals they contain
a<00:01:35.729> chance<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.600> three<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:37.259> four<00:01:37.770> star

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
a chance to get a three or four star

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
a chance to get a three or four star
original<00:01:39.750> magneto<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:40.500> marvel<00:01:41.159> now<00:01:41.520> magneto

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
original magneto or marvel now magneto

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
original magneto or marvel now magneto
so<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.200> purple<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.130> white<00:01:44.579> costume

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so the purple or the white costume

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.929 
so the purple or the white costume
denied<00:01:45.539> needle<00:01:46.250> fearless<00:01:47.250> crystals<00:01:47.700> were

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
denied needle fearless crystals were

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.380 
denied needle fearless crystals were
also<00:01:48.359> a<00:01:48.390> daredevil<00:01:48.810> run<00:01:49.319> series<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> those

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
also a daredevil run series so those

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.740 
also a daredevil run series so those
don't<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.810> magneto<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.500> them<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:57.030> Tsar<00:01:57.450> Black

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
don't have magneto in them to Tsar Black

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830 
don't have magneto in them to Tsar Black
Widow<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> hopefully<00:02:00.270> we've<00:02:00.450> gotten<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
Widow so hopefully we've gotten all of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.139 
Widow so hopefully we've gotten all of
our<00:02:01.079> two<00:02:01.289> stars<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> way<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.000> only

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
our two stars out of the way and we only

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.089 
our two stars out of the way and we only
get<00:02:03.299> three<00:02:03.630> third<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> four<00:02:04.259> stars<00:02:04.560> from<00:02:04.770> here

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
get three third and four stars from here

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:12.440 
get three third and four stars from here
on<00:02:05.250> out

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.890 

so<00:02:13.050> let's<00:02:13.500> let<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.280> crappy<00:02:15.090> animation<00:02:15.690> one

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so let's let this crappy animation one

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.119 
so let's let this crappy animation one
through<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.739> see<00:02:19.769> I'm<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.010> a

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
through and as you can see I'm in a

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.070 
through and as you can see I'm in a
different<00:02:20.489> location<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:21.300> now<00:02:21.510> I'm

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
different location right now I'm

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.830 
different location right now I'm
actually<00:02:22.319> downstairs<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.010> living<00:02:23.489> room

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
actually downstairs in my living room

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.259 
actually downstairs in my living room
I'm<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.050> trying<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.379> be<00:02:25.709> as<00:02:26.640> loud<00:02:27.030> my

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
