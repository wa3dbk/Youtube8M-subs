00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.090
 The autocad drawing area has 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.150
 default way a very grid 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.930
 dim gray color at the bottom 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.990
 left we have three chips the first 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.850
 called model that is what we use 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.640
 basically to draw the other 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.190
 two serve to generate views of 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.190
 our design in our drawing for 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.620
 trace effects also in that part 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.480
 we found the icon that represents the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.970
 axes and the x axis to the right we have 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.730
 tools that fundamentally serve 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.520
 to arrange our drawing of diverse 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.280
 ways to change the view that 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.280
 we have the first of them 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.900
 it's called bio club and it's used 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:06.250
 fundamentally to handle 3d models 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.250
 as you can see here 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.770
 the second one is called precisely bar 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.039
 of navigation and has several buttons that 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.740
 we are going to study and we will review more 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.300
 forward but that we can mention in 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.780
 the first one is called sting wheel 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.890
 is a navigation wheel that pressing 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.570
 which gives the cursor given to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.729
 and has many of them 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.810
 tools that we found in it 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.810
 navigation bar 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.939
 the second one serves to displace the 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.390
 drawings and be able to frame them as is their 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.219
 name on screen the third button we 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.939
 gives access to all variants of the 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.939
 zoom command 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.730
 the next one is called orbit and also 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.180
 It is mainly used for models 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.180
 3d 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.890
 finally we have a command called 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.790
 show motion that is generating a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.290
 animation of the different movements 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.629
 what we do in 3d models 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.629
 and that we will also review later 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.400
 an element of the drawing area that is not 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.770
 new in the 2013 version of autocad but 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.319
 that we had not mentioned in videos of 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.720
 Previous versions of this program is 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.790
 the set of links that are in the 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.239
 upper left corner of that same 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.910
 drawing area are three links that give 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.370
 fundamentally access to elements of 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.430
 display that affect precisely 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.230
 to the drawing area each of them the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.590
 We will study in detail the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.840
 tools that contain but not 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 we had mentioned that this is a way 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.610
 of access to these tools we had 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.860
 used in his case fundamentally the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.440
 Ribbon in the first case 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.130
 we have a script rather it's a sign 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.049
 unless you open a menu with which I can 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.150
 activate or deactivate the bar 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.510
 navigation that is in Ã¡lava in the same 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.930
 drawing area the right side too 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.400
 we can activate or deactivate view club or 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.710
 ok the navigation wheel 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.650
 sting wild 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.230
 it also allows me 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.150
 and modify the window settings 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.340
 graphics I insist this is a subject that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.340
 we will study in detail later 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.019
 we can divide it with this menu 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.239
 the drawing area in two and up to three 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.810
 graphic windows each of which 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.030
 shows a view of the model and between 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.940
 these may be different 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.450
 the second link gives me an access 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.600
 fast to the default views of 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.850
 autocad for models 3 of each 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.730
 3d model can have a top view 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.299
 lower left to right your 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.239
 different isometric views and so on 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.270
 well this link is a quick access to 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.620
 those predetermined views since I have 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.040
 divided on the windows screen 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.230
 graphics you can catch some of them and 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.750
 so modify the view we have of the 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.750
 model I will do here an approach 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.520
 and we are going to make a frame 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.230
 As I'm doing it, I'm going to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.620
 study it later 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.840
 the third link that is on the corner 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.700
 upper left of the drawing area and 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.210
 in this case in each of the windows 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.110
 graphics gives me access to the different 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.110
 Visual styles 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.840
 I'm going to modify the visual style of this 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.830
 graphic window to one that is called 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.830
 realistic 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.460
 let's also modify the 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.790
 visualization I will make a view 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.500
 customized 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.500
 there is good 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.800
 and only for example purposes I insist 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.630
 reservation to study it later we go 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.300
 to modify the visual style of the 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.330
 last graphic window 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.319
 indicating for example a style 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.319
 hidden 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.380
 I will also modify the view to 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.380
 appreciate the result 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.249
 ready
