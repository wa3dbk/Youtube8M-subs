00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello, good morning, I am going to teach you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.469
 how do I apply 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 juni's mascara look at me apply my 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.160
 first of jong and here is so that what 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.770
 see that makes you leave you very smooth 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.169
 skin and you can your makeup is going to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.250
 last all day you leave it very smooth 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.090
 pretty very very soft and very natural and 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.770
 here I have the two rhythms 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.150
 although the big one is collagen the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.040
 tiny are the fibers of green tea 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.050
 everything is very natural is not going to do 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.120
 damage to your eyes ok 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.280
 as you can see I do not have anything of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.640
 tabs 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:53.540
 ok I'm shell here 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:56.140
 and you are these are the fibers that I already 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.760
 I put a black eyeliner inside 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:05.800
 you can see it ok now let's apply 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 The first layer of our collagen 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.570
 can see me here I'll be seeing in 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.570
 My mirror 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.920
 It is proposed to apply very well that is 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.970
 well wet your eyelashes with the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.530
 unique gel transplant 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.530
 although here they have it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.630
 it's on all its tabs that's left 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.670
 well well wet 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.549
 from above down there is 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.710
 ok without letting it dry immediately be 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:47.140
 they apply their fibers from bottom to top 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.719
 that stick very well this is what 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.390
 will lengthen them is going to give the look of 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.870
 super super long eyelashes ok 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.350
 you can apply a layer or two is already a 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.840
 your taste we are going to apply 2 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.310
 and I recommend you obviously first 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:13.010
 make an eye and then lotus ok 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.860
 here I applied my fibers and go back to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.170
 seal with the collagen again 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.530
 in this way your fibers are not going to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.530
 fall out 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:33.340
 although you always have to follow them 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.340
 well there it is 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.560
 okay 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.269
 here it is 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.200
 in the difference 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.519
 this is 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.560
 only with a layer of direct we are going to 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.310
 watch 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.340
 it's okay just with the layer you want extra 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.260
 long you win again to hell ' 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.260
 you apply it again 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.530
 so they can do it again ok 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.040
 very well applied 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.069
 okay 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.569
 you regain your fibers again 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.569
 you apply them again here they are 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.569
 look 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.580
 above and below that also 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.580
 they come well applied 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.739
 although they already apply and fibers and again 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.110
 I reseal it with the transplant ok 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.790
 you can see 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.019
 they live 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.019
 look how it looks 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.420
 eye 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.860
 this is to seal is the last step 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.760
 see that the two remain 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.420
 come now 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.150
 It's very simple to use, you apply it to 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.150
 daily you take it off as you take a 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.710
 irregular rhythm 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.940
 okay 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.590
 this is johnny 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.490
 see the difference look 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.180
 very very simple if you want to fix yourself 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.969
 under your eyelashes 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:46.029
 without putting it in, then it is not so much 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.160
 with this in case you have any left 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.350
 fiber out there 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.770
 It's all you have to be more than 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.860
 brushes a little bit this is what you 're going to 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.860
 obtain 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.700
 a big difference 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.600
 I love iunika products 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.600
 we also have lipsticks 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.530
 From my favorites 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.490
 of the same 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.290
 for any questions 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.029
 I'm going to leave my data here below in 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.879
 the video so they can contact me if they have 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:28.859
 some doubt how to get it though 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.859
