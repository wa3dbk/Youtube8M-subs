this<00:00:59.280> probably<00:00:59.789> won't<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this probably won't be that kind of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
this probably won't be that kind of
legendary<00:01:01.260> puzzle<00:01:01.739> game<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> does<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
legendary puzzle game but it does do a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
legendary puzzle game but it does do a
lot<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> things<00:01:03.449> you'd<00:01:03.629> expect<00:01:03.690> from<00:01:04.199> one

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
lot of the things you'd expect from one

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
lot of the things you'd expect from one
for<00:01:04.949> example<00:01:05.369> using<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> common<00:01:06.450> little

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
for example using a common little

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
for example using a common little
childhood<00:01:07.320> activity<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.040> connect-the-dots

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
childhood activity like connect-the-dots

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.359 
childhood activity like connect-the-dots
as<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.900> framework<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.740> pretty<00:01:11.070> smart

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
as the framework for some pretty smart

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.179 
as the framework for some pretty smart
gameplay<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.720> each<00:01:13.080> stage<00:01:13.530> gives<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> an

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
gameplay so each stage gives you an

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
gameplay so each stage gives you an
arrangement<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.820> stars<00:01:15.090> your<00:01:15.689> objective<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
arrangement of stars your objective is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
arrangement of stars your objective is
to<00:01:16.530> connect<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.100> lines<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.970> tap<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to connect them with lines you tap a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 
to connect them with lines you tap a
star<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> tap<00:01:19.530> another<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> line

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
star and when you tap another a line

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640 
star and when you tap another a line
forms<00:01:20.820> between<00:01:21.030> them<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.840> idea<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
forms between them the idea is to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.050 
forms between them the idea is to
connect<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.700> after<00:01:24.030> another

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
connect them all one after another

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.870 
connect them all one after another
without<00:01:24.840> crossing<00:01:25.380> any<00:01:25.619> lines<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.310> you're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
without crossing any lines so you're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.330 
without crossing any lines so you're
basically<00:01:27.030> creating<00:01:27.840> shapes<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> cosmos

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
basically creating shapes in the cosmos

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
basically creating shapes in the cosmos
those<00:01:29.909> turn<00:01:30.180> into<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.630> time<00:01:31.049> warps<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
those turn into these time warps and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
those turn into these time warps and
then<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> travel<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> way<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.380> next

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
then you travel all the way to the next

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
then you travel all the way to the next
puzzle<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.850> problem<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:37.020> these

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
puzzle the problem is you have all these

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
puzzle the problem is you have all these
little<00:01:37.520> Meatwad<00:01:38.520> look-alikes<00:01:39.150> floating

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
little Meatwad look-alikes floating

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.510 
little Meatwad look-alikes floating
through<00:01:40.049> space<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.680> obviously<00:01:41.130> that's<00:01:41.310> an

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
through space and obviously that's an

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
through space and obviously that's an
issue<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:42.090> you're<00:01:42.240> drawing<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:43.020> portals<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
issue when you're drawing up portals so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
issue when you're drawing up portals so
whatever<00:01:44.399> shapes<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.939> come<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
whatever shapes you come up with the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.649 
whatever shapes you come up with the
enemies<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.890> outside<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> lines<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
enemies have to be outside the lines so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
enemies have to be outside the lines so
as<00:01:49.020> you'd<00:01:49.229> expect<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.220> plenty<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
as you'd expect there are also plenty of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.520 
as you'd expect there are also plenty of
different<00:01:51.060> stars<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.049> affect<00:01:52.380> your

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
different stars that can affect your

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
different stars that can affect your
line<00:01:52.799> drawing<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.670> flying<00:01:54.030> stars<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
line drawing there are flying stars that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200 
line drawing there are flying stars that
constantly<00:01:55.740> change<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.369> angles<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:57.119> are

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
constantly change your angles there are

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240

toward them they're even stars that can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
toward them they're even stars that can
destroy<00:02:01.439> enemies<00:02:01.920> those<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:02.759> called<00:02:02.969> ninja
