meteor shower in front of the planet now
my<00:00:08.800> meteors<00:00:09.190> are<00:00:09.520> in<00:00:09.820> the<00:00:10.060> foreground<00:00:10.300> and<00:00:10.660> my

my meteors are in the foreground and my

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.180 
my meteors are in the foreground and my
planet<00:00:11.140> is<00:00:11.230> in<00:00:11.380> the<00:00:11.470> background<00:00:11.650> so<00:00:12.040> we're

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
planet is in the background so we're

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.180 
planet is in the background so we're
going<00:00:12.340> to<00:00:12.490> make<00:00:12.670> it<00:00:12.820> look<00:00:13.030> like<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.920> it<00:00:15.070> has

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
going to make it look like like it has

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.980 
going to make it look like like it has
some<00:00:15.370> serious<00:00:15.640> perspective<00:00:16.359> by<00:00:16.539> making<00:00:16.869> our

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
some serious perspective by making our

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.589 
some serious perspective by making our
planet<00:00:17.289> kind<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.619> foggy<00:00:17.919> and<00:00:18.189> faraway<00:00:18.519> and<00:00:19.509> by

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
planet kind of foggy and faraway and by

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.370 
planet kind of foggy and faraway and by
making<00:00:19.900> our<00:00:20.019> meteors<00:00:20.320> kind<00:00:20.560> of<00:00:20.650> sharp<00:00:22.380> strong

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
making our meteors kind of sharp strong

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.710 
making our meteors kind of sharp strong
colors<00:00:23.800> so<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.699> make<00:00:24.880> our<00:00:25.029> planet<00:00:25.269> I'm<00:00:25.480> just

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
colors so to make our planet I'm just

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.269 
colors so to make our planet I'm just
gonna<00:00:25.839> use<00:00:26.019> a<00:00:26.050> little<00:00:26.199> Montana<00:00:26.769> blue<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.220> I'm

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
gonna use a little Montana blue and I'm

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.589 
gonna use a little Montana blue and I'm
going<00:00:27.400> to<00:00:27.429> use<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.579> little<00:00:27.789> bit<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:28.029> a<00:00:28.089> molotov

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
going to use a little bit of a molotov

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.739 
going to use a little bit of a molotov
soft<00:00:29.560> white<00:00:29.890> it's<00:00:30.220> it's<00:00:30.640> transparent<00:00:31.599> white

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
soft white it's it's transparent white

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.630 
soft white it's it's transparent white
now<00:00:32.410> you<00:00:32.470> could<00:00:32.680> use<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.830> color<00:00:33.130> place<00:00:33.370> white

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
now you could use a color place white

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.860 
now you could use a color place white
that<00:00:34.180> would<00:00:34.240> be<00:00:34.360> fine

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
that would be fine

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.300 
that would be fine
or<00:00:35.200> you<00:00:35.350> could<00:00:35.500> just<00:00:35.530> use<00:00:35.800> just<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.160> small

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
or you could just use just a small

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.190 
or you could just use just a small
amount<00:00:36.670> of<00:00:36.850> here<00:00:37.090> your<00:00:37.600> regular<00:00:37.990> white

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
amount of here your regular white

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.050 
amount of here your regular white
painter's<00:00:38.920> touch<00:00:39.130> or<00:00:39.370> Kryolan<00:00:39.730> or<00:00:39.850> whatever

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
painter's touch or Kryolan or whatever

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.820 
painter's touch or Kryolan or whatever
but<00:00:40.240> the<00:00:40.330> idea<00:00:40.510> is<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.720> we<00:00:40.840> we<00:00:41.380> want<00:00:41.590> this

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
but the idea is that we we want this

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.750 
but the idea is that we we want this
planet<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.310> be<00:00:42.340> kind<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.670> soft<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.210> fuzzy<00:00:44.760> now

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
planet to be kind of soft and fuzzy now

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.950 
planet to be kind of soft and fuzzy now
I'm<00:00:45.820> just<00:00:45.940> gonna<00:00:46.030> try<00:00:46.300> something<00:00:46.660> new<00:00:46.780> for

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
I'm just gonna try something new for

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'm just gonna try something new for
kicks<00:00:47.200> I'm<00:00:47.410> gonna<00:00:47.560> try<00:00:47.740> blending<00:00:48.040> in<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
kicks I'm gonna try blending in the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720 
kicks I'm gonna try blending in the
paint<00:00:49.930> with<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> sponge<00:00:50.560> no<00:00:51.250> since<00:00:51.490> I'm<00:00:51.610> working

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
paint with a sponge no since I'm working

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.780 
paint with a sponge no since I'm working
on<00:00:51.940> black<00:00:52.150> poster<00:00:52.540> board<00:00:53.130> as<00:00:54.130> I<00:00:54.310> blend<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:54.760> that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
on black poster board as I blend in that

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.640 
on black poster board as I blend in that
blue<00:00:55.150> paint<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.630> just<00:00:55.660> gets<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.290> know<00:00:56.320> fades

blue paint it just gets you know fades

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.590 
blue paint it just gets you know fades
into<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:56.980> black<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:58.030> then<00:00:58.150> I<00:00:58.210> could<00:00:58.329> put<00:00:58.420> some

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
into the black and then I could put some

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.360 
into the black and then I could put some
spray<00:00:58.840> over<00:00:59.230> that<00:00:59.380> but<00:00:59.920> I'm<00:01:00.070> just<00:01:00.220> trying

meteors are gonna go and make sure that
there<00:03:18.329> are<00:03:18.389> some<00:03:18.510> big<00:03:18.690> ones<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.169> there's<00:03:19.319> some

little ones put the majority of your

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.210 
little ones put the majority of your
meteors<00:03:27.290> in<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.799> place<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.189> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
meteors in the in a place in the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.259 
meteors in the in a place in the
painting<00:03:29.579> where<00:03:29.669> you're<00:03:29.760> gonna<00:03:29.849> see<00:03:30.090> them

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
know put them in front of the planet

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.619 
know put them in front of the planet
that's<00:03:33.870> what<00:03:33.989> we<00:03:34.079> prepared<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:35.449> and<00:03:36.449> just

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629

just with your finger dab it on the side

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.869 
just with your finger dab it on the side
of<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.500> meteors<00:04:04.799> which<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.159> facing<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.640> Sun

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
of the meteors which is facing the Sun

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.339 
of the meteors which is facing the Sun
because<00:04:06.269> that's<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.569> course<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> side<00:04:07.170> that

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
because that's of course the side that

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.979 
because that's of course the side that
it's<00:04:07.439> getting<00:04:07.560> lit<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.599> ones<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.900> are

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
it's getting lit and the ones that are

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.119 
it's getting lit and the ones that are
closer<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:10.530> Sun<00:04:10.680> are<00:04:10.829> gonna<00:04:10.920> have<00:04:11.099> a

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
closer to the Sun are gonna have a

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.879 
closer to the Sun are gonna have a
little<00:04:11.280> bit<00:04:11.430> more<00:04:11.519> highlight<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.769> you're

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
little bit more highlight so you're

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.500 
little bit more highlight so you're
creating<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.400> bit<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.760> shape<00:04:15.030> you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
creating a little bit of a shape you

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.689 
creating a little bit of a shape you
don't<00:04:15.659> need<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.930> actually<00:04:16.079> create<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.889> lot<00:04:17.549> of

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
don't need to actually create a lot of

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.749 
don't need to actually create a lot of
detail<00:04:18.060> here<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.810> little<00:04:19.019> bit<00:04:19.139> of<00:04:19.199> a<00:04:19.289> shape

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
detail here just a little bit of a shape

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.009 
detail here just a little bit of a shape
in<00:04:20.759> highlighting<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.479> side<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.870> those

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
in highlighting the side of those

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.420 
in highlighting the side of those
meteors<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:22.410> facing<00:04:22.949> towards<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.220> Sun

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
meteors that's facing towards the Sun

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.439 
meteors that's facing towards the Sun
and<00:04:23.490> when<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.849> blend<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.240> with<00:04:24.270> your

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
and when you blend it in with your

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.659 
and when you blend it in with your
finger<00:04:24.780> you'll<00:04:24.960> get<00:04:25.139> some<00:04:25.320> gray<00:04:25.560> in<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.490> too

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
finger you'll get some gray in there too

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.939 
finger you'll get some gray in there too
so<00:04:26.940> it'll<00:04:27.090> start<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.539> start<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.560> look<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.860> little

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
so it'll start to start to look a little

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.270 
so it'll start to start to look a little
bit<00:04:29.130> more<00:04:29.310> complex<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:30.030> real<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:32.160> then<00:04:32.250> you

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
bit more complex and real and then you

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.029 
bit more complex and real and then you
can<00:04:32.490> add<00:04:32.639> some<00:04:32.940> little<00:04:33.060> touches<00:04:33.509> of<00:04:33.539> green

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
can add some little touches of green

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.350 
can add some little touches of green
touches<00:04:35.039> of<00:04:35.310> blue<00:04:35.580> here<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:35.970> there<00:04:36.210> the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
touches of blue here and there the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.490 
touches of blue here and there the
farther<00:04:36.630> away<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:37.020> you're<00:04:37.169> getting<00:04:37.320> from

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
farther away that you're getting from

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.050 
farther away that you're getting from
the<00:04:37.530> Sun<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.009> more<00:04:38.130> blue<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.550> green<00:04:38.759> you<00:04:38.940> want

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the Sun the more blue and green you want

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.850 
the Sun the more blue and green you want
to<00:04:39.210> add<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:39.599> a<00:04:39.660> highlight<00:04:39.990> because<00:04:40.680> it's

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
to add it's a highlight because it's

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.409 
to add it's a highlight because it's
getting<00:04:41.130> darker<00:04:43.639> I'm<00:04:44.639> just<00:04:44.910> dabbing<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.330> out

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
getting darker I'm just dabbing it out

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.820 
getting darker I'm just dabbing it out
with<00:04:45.509> my<00:04:45.630> fingers<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.960> little<00:04:46.199> bit<00:04:46.289> of<00:04:46.380> blue<00:04:46.590> but

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
with my fingers a little bit of blue but

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.610 
with my fingers a little bit of blue but
always<00:04:46.979> on<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.970> side<00:04:48.150> that's<00:04:48.360> facing<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.780> Sun

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.140 

and<00:04:52.620> just<00:04:52.860> blend<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.460> in<00:04:53.520> with<00:04:53.580> my<00:04:53.820> fingers

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
and just blend it in with my fingers

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.000 
and just blend it in with my fingers
until<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.479> looks<00:04:54.750> like<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.960> rock<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.470> me<00:04:58.010> and

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
until it looks like a rock to me and
