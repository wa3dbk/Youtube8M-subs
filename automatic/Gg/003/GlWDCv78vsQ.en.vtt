00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
ourselves and it is a nice way to start

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380 
ourselves and it is a nice way to start
the<00:00:51.989> day<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.920> an<00:00:53.070> inward<00:00:53.789> turning

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the day right and it's an inward turning

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.080 
the day right and it's an inward turning
quality<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.949> evening<00:00:56.579> we've<00:00:56.820> got

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
quality but this evening we've got

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
quality but this evening we've got
blast-off<00:00:57.960> energy<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> moon<00:00:59.190> going

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
blast-off energy we have the moon going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
blast-off energy we have the moon going
into<00:00:59.879> leo<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> happens<00:01:00.930> every<00:01:01.170> month

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
into leo now that happens every month

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.080 
into leo now that happens every month
that's<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.859> too<00:01:02.129> dramatic<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.940> does

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that's not too dramatic but it does

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
that's not too dramatic but it does
shift<00:01:03.359> us<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.899> cancer<00:01:04.229> reticence<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
shift us from that cancer reticence to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.270 
shift us from that cancer reticence to
the<00:01:05.729> drama<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.540> Leo<00:01:06.810> expression<00:01:07.799> yeah<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the drama of Leo expression yeah and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
the drama of Leo expression yeah and
Leos<00:01:09.270> key<00:01:09.689> ruling<00:01:10.110> planet<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> Sun<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
Leos key ruling planet the Sun is in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240 
Leos key ruling planet the Sun is in
play<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> big<00:01:12.540> way<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
play in a big way right and I think that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
play in a big way right and I think that
will<00:01:14.400> feel<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> throughout<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.600> day<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
will feel that throughout the day it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.800 
will feel that throughout the day it
won't<00:01:16.080> take<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.770> moon<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.340> into<00:01:17.729> leo<00:01:17.970> later

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
won't take the moon going into leo later

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.070 
won't take the moon going into leo later
in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> day<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.950> feel<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.490> sun's<00:01:21.080> opposition

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
in the day to feel the sun's opposition

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.890 
in the day to feel the sun's opposition
to<00:01:22.320> Jupiter<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.250> Sun<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.700> Jupiter<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:24.150> what

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
to Jupiter the Sun and Jupiter are what

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.160 
to Jupiter the Sun and Jupiter are what
ninety-nine<00:01:25.530> percent<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:26.909> over<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and the sun's opposition to Jupiter is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.740 
and the sun's opposition to Jupiter is
like<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> tug-of-war<00:01:35.130> between<00:01:35.820> these<00:01:36.210> huge

and do something well and I think how we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.120 
and do something well and I think how we
can<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.329> work<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:58.890> our
