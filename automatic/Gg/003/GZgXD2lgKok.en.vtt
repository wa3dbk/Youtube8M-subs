00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
so guys it's not trying to hear again am

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.339 
so guys it's not trying to hear again am
I<00:00:06.590> getting<00:00:06.710> to<00:00:06.889> you<00:00:06.979> yet<00:00:07.660> we<00:00:08.660> introduced<00:00:09.139> a

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
I getting to you yet we introduced a

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.220 
I getting to you yet we introduced a
concept<00:00:09.410> of<00:00:10.250> anti-rotation<00:00:10.910> in<00:00:11.360> earlier

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
concept of anti-rotation in earlier

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.530 
concept of anti-rotation in earlier
video<00:00:12.500> and<00:00:12.800> exercise<00:00:13.790> that<00:00:13.970> we<00:00:14.090> do<00:00:14.240> is<00:00:14.360> call

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
video and exercise that we do is call

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.980 
video and exercise that we do is call
Pusha<00:00:14.750> ways<00:00:14.990> so<00:00:15.740> from<00:00:16.039> an<00:00:16.129> athletic<00:00:16.219> stance

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
Pusha ways so from an athletic stance

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.149 
Pusha ways so from an athletic stance
just<00:00:17.990> pushing<00:00:18.320> a<00:00:18.380> band<00:00:18.589> away<00:00:18.829> from<00:00:19.039> your

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:19.159 
just pushing a band away from your

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.009 
just pushing a band away from your
opponent<00:00:19.189> towards<00:00:19.849> you<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.570> essentially

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
opponent towards you so essentially

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.259 
opponent towards you so essentially
turning<00:00:21.349> the<00:00:21.560> tension<00:00:21.919> on<00:00:22.039> here<00:00:22.339> and<00:00:22.519> turning

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
turning the tension on here and turning

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.099 
turning the tension on here and turning
it<00:00:23.359> off<00:00:23.769> so<00:00:24.769> I<00:00:24.829> want<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.039> build<00:00:25.189> off<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:25.339> today

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
it off so I want to build off that today

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.929 
it off so I want to build off that today
one<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.199> main<00:00:27.349> reasons<00:00:27.710> is<00:00:27.769> because<00:00:27.859> a<00:00:28.399> lot

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
one of the main reasons is because a lot

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.279 
one of the main reasons is because a lot
of<00:00:28.970> times<00:00:29.179> we<00:00:29.329> look<00:00:29.480> for<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:29.749> one<00:00:29.929> exercise

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
of times we look for that one exercise

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.679 
of times we look for that one exercise
to<00:00:30.439> really<00:00:30.769> have<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.039> drastic<00:00:31.550> effect<00:00:31.640> on<00:00:32.419> our

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
to really have a drastic effect on our

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.569 
to really have a drastic effect on our
training<00:00:33.140> in<00:00:33.290> even<00:00:33.769> though<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:33.949> existed<00:00:34.399> it's

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
training in even though it existed it's

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.130 
training in even though it existed it's
really<00:00:34.850> really<00:00:35.149> rare<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.359> find<00:00:35.600> them<00:00:35.899> really

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
really really rare to find them really

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.630 
really really rare to find them really
one<00:00:36.530> pearl<00:00:37.519> of<00:00:38.449> an<00:00:38.600> exercise<00:00:39.019> if<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.199> will<00:00:39.640> so

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
one pearl of an exercise if you will so

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.419 
one pearl of an exercise if you will so
what<00:00:40.910> works<00:00:41.120> really<00:00:41.390> well<00:00:41.539> is<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.679> walk<00:00:43.280> the

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
what works really well is to walk the

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:44.560 
what works really well is to walk the
whole<00:00:43.550> sequence<00:00:43.969> of<00:00:44.210> different<00:00:44.480> movies

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
whole sequence of different movies

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.329 
whole sequence of different movies
together<00:00:44.899> all<00:00:45.679> right<00:00:45.859> so<00:00:46.039> we're<00:00:46.160> going<00:00:46.250> to

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
together all right so we're going to

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.369 
together all right so we're going to
keep<00:00:46.489> rotation<00:00:47.179> in<00:00:47.239> mind<00:00:47.420> today<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.289> we're

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
keep rotation in mind today and we're

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.660 
keep rotation in mind today and we're
going<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.559> throw<00:00:48.649> three<00:00:48.980> different<00:00:49.309> movements

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
going to throw three different movements

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.200 
going to throw three different movements
laro<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.839> varying<00:00:51.289> intensity<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:52.429> will<00:00:52.730> have

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
laro a varying intensity that will have

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.360 
laro a varying intensity that will have
an<00:00:53.359> overall<00:00:53.660> damping<00:00:54.140> effect<00:00:54.260> on<00:00:54.679> all<00:00:55.219> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
an overall damping effect on all the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.079 
an overall damping effect on all the
exercises<00:00:56.620> as<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.679> group<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:58.309> if<00:00:58.609> I'll<00:00:58.730> do<00:00:58.969> them

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
exercises as a group so if I'll do them

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.489 
exercises as a group so if I'll do them
individually<00:00:59.239> they<00:00:59.719> might<00:00:59.870> not<00:00:59.960> be<00:01:00.109> bad<00:01:00.289> they

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
individually they might not be bad they

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.110 
individually they might not be bad they
will<00:01:00.589> probably<00:01:00.859> be<00:01:00.920> effective<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:01.909> when<00:01:02.059> you

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
will probably be effective but when you

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.880 
will probably be effective but when you
do<00:01:02.239> them<00:01:02.390> all<00:01:02.539> in<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.690> row<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:03.469> end<00:01:03.589> up<00:01:03.649> creating

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
do them all in a row you end up creating

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.160 
do them all in a row you end up creating
a<00:01:04.100> pre<00:01:04.370> fatiguing<00:01:04.850> effect<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.720> ends<00:01:06.110> up

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
a pre fatiguing effect that ends up

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.920 
a pre fatiguing effect that ends up
really<00:01:06.560> intensifying<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.940> latter<00:01:08.150> exercises

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
really intensifying the latter exercises

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.420 
really intensifying the latter exercises
that's<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:09.680> let's<00:01:09.830> mess<00:01:09.980> around<00:01:10.010> this<00:01:10.370> a

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
that's so let's mess around this a

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.610 
that's so let's mess around this a
little<00:01:10.580> bit<00:01:10.870> and<00:01:11.870> I'm<00:01:11.990> gonna<00:01:12.080> start<00:01:12.320> with<00:01:12.380> one

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
little bit and I'm gonna start with one

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.430 
little bit and I'm gonna start with one
with<00:01:13.280> just<00:01:13.460> actually<00:01:13.730> an<00:01:13.970> active<00:01:14.390> chop<00:01:14.660> where

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
with just actually an active chop where

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.510 
with just actually an active chop where
I'm<00:01:15.530> going<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.710> get<00:01:15.830> into<00:01:16.010> my<00:01:16.130> push<00:01:16.340> away

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
I'm going to get into my push away

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.730 
I'm going to get into my push away
stands<00:01:16.880> here<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.390> i<00:01:18.020> already<00:01:18.260> have<00:01:18.470> tension

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
stands here and i already have tension

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.590 
stands here and i already have tension
here<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.280> now<00:01:19.760> from<00:01:20.000> here<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.330> i'm<00:01:20.420> going<00:01:20.540> to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
here and now from here what i'm going to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.650 
here and now from here what i'm going to
do<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.990> I'm<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.590> going<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.860> start<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.480> fire<00:01:23.480> up

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
do is I'm just going to start to fire up

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.200 
do is I'm just going to start to fire up
the<00:01:23.750> core<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.170> obliques<00:01:24.610> this<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.820> limit<00:01:26.180> to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
the core the obliques this is a limit to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.450 
the core the obliques this is a limit to
just<00:01:26.420> my<00:01:26.600> front<00:01:26.900> core<00:01:27.170> since<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:27.920> am<00:01:27.950> rotating

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
just my front core since I am rotating

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.610 
just my front core since I am rotating
I'm<00:01:29.180> going<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.540> some<00:01:29.750> side<00:01:30.020> court<00:01:30.380> and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
I'm going to have some side court and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.570 
I'm going to have some side court and
also<00:01:31.040> back<00:01:31.640> core<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.420> due<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.320> the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
also back core going on due to the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.190 
also back core going on due to the
diagonal<00:01:35.380> orientation<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.500> obliques<00:01:38.200> all

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
diagonal orientation of the obliques all

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.260 
diagonal orientation of the obliques all
right<00:01:39.380> I'm<00:01:40.370> even<00:01:40.640> going<00:01:40.730> to<00:01:40.790> emphasize<00:01:41.240> a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
right I'm even going to emphasize a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.090 
right I'm even going to emphasize a
couple<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.780> nice<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.170> breakers<00:01:42.620> once<00:01:42.800> i<00:01:42.950> get

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
couple of nice I breakers once i get

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.630 
couple of nice I breakers once i get
back<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.520> tension<00:01:43.820> here<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.100> my<00:01:46.100> court<00:01:46.460> is

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
back to this tension here so my court is

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.060 
back to this tension here so my court is
through<00:01:46.910> constant<00:01:47.390> tension<00:01:47.600> here<00:01:48.040> alright<00:01:49.040> i

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
through constant tension here alright i

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.010 
through constant tension here alright i
do<00:01:49.220> more<00:01:49.460> than<00:01:49.610> 10<00:01:49.790> reps<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.120> just<00:01:50.810> shoot<00:01:50.990> for

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
do more than 10 reps but just shoot for

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.760 
do more than 10 reps but just shoot for
10<00:01:51.320> reps<00:01:51.550> once<00:01:52.550> i<00:01:52.700> get<00:01:52.940> 10<00:01:53.150> go<00:01:54.110> into<00:01:54.320> exercise

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
10 reps once i get 10 go into exercise

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.770 
10 reps once i get 10 go into exercise
to<00:01:55.070> which<00:01:55.370> I'm<00:01:55.520> going<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.700> go<00:01:55.820> into<00:01:55.970> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
to which I'm going to go into the

to which I'm going to go into the
pushaway<00:01:57.170> switch<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:58.280> guys<00:01:58.460> already<00:01:59.330> know

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
pushaway switch you guys already know

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.840 
pushaway switch you guys already know
this<00:01:59.720> one<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.040> little<00:02:01.250> bit<00:02:01.340> harder<00:02:01.700> now

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
this one it's a little bit harder now

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.370 
this one it's a little bit harder now
because<00:02:01.880> I'm<00:02:02.540> already<00:02:02.780> starting<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.230> cook<00:02:03.320> a

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
because I'm already starting to cook a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:12.670 
because I'm already starting to cook a
little<00:02:03.560> bit<00:02:05.860> making<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.010> harder

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.170 

last<00:02:13.680> but<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:13.890> least<00:02:14.010> one<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.670> my<00:02:14.760> favorites

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
last but not least one of my favorites

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.420 
last but not least one of my favorites
walk<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> arms<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> upper<00:02:16.890> body<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.220> now

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
walk the arms in the upper body and now

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.000 
walk the arms in the upper body and now
from<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:17.670> introduce<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> lower<00:02:19.740> body

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
from here introduce the lower body

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
from here introduce the lower body
movement<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:24.150> about<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.660> being

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
movement so now think about this being

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.830 
movement so now think about this being
essentially<00:02:25.770> an<00:02:25.830> exercise<00:02:26.280> where<00:02:26.840> every

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
essentially an exercise where every

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.800 
essentially an exercise where every
muscle<00:02:28.020> from<00:02:28.610> my<00:02:29.610> thumbnail<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.270> my<00:02:30.390> toe<00:02:30.450> now

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
muscle from my thumbnail to my toe now

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.230 
muscle from my thumbnail to my toe now
everything<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.320> between<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.620> working<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:33.030> has

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
everything in between is working it has

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.810 
everything in between is working it has
to<00:02:33.420> doesn't<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> choice<00:02:34.820> all

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
to doesn't really have a choice all

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.450 
to doesn't really have a choice all
right<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.690> lot<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.960> times

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
right just like a lot of times

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.430 
right just like a lot of times
athletically<00:02:38.460> speaking<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.930> I'm<00:02:40.140> out<00:02:40.260> there

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
athletically speaking if I'm out there

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.460 
athletically speaking if I'm out there
doing<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.800> run<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.100> glades<00:02:42.230> my<00:02:43.230> entire

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
doing a run in the glades my entire

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.060 
doing a run in the glades my entire
bodies<00:02:43.950> active<00:02:44.160> moving<00:02:44.840> I'm<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:46.260> focusing<00:02:46.860> on

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
bodies active moving I'm not focusing on

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.070 
bodies active moving I'm not focusing on
which<00:02:47.580> muscle<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.030> contracting<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.750> which<00:02:48.900> is

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
which muscle is contracting and which is

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470 
which muscle is contracting and which is
not<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:50.250> focusing<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> task<00:02:51.090> at<00:02:51.420> hand

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
not I'm focusing on the task at hand

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.650 
not I'm focusing on the task at hand
which<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.190> picking<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.310> line<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:54.150> avoid<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
which is picking a line and avoid the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.530 
which is picking a line and avoid the
trees<00:02:55.340> all<00:02:56.340> right<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
trees all right so this is going to be a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.770 
trees all right so this is going to be a
really<00:02:57.960> nice<00:02:58.110> dynamic<00:02:58.410> movement<00:02:59.690> adding<00:03:00.690> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
really nice dynamic movement adding a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.070 
really nice dynamic movement adding a
lot<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.110> different<00:03:01.140> things<00:03:02.780> beneficial<00:03:03.780> not

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
lot of different things beneficial not

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.980 
lot of different things beneficial not
for<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.470> obviously<00:03:04.830> snowboarding<00:03:05.400> skiing

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
for just obviously snowboarding skiing

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.220 

money<00:03:13.410> really<00:03:13.800> really<00:03:14.100> good<00:03:14.300> now<00:03:15.300> another

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
money really really good now another

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.530 
money really really good now another
important<00:03:16.680> thing<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.830> think<00:03:16.890> about<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.540> by

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
important thing to think about is by

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.150 
important thing to think about is by
doing<00:03:18.600> exercises<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.620> together<00:03:19.830> I'm

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
doing exercises like this together I'm

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.310 
doing exercises like this together I'm
really<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> chance<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.880> focus<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:22.290> area

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
really get a chance to focus on one area

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.380 
really get a chance to focus on one area
especially<00:03:22.980> with<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.550> series<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.240> just

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
especially with this series that we just

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.900 
especially with this series that we just
did<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.750> focused<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.260> my<00:03:25.950> core<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.459> was<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.640> big

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
did it focused on my core it was a big

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.410 
did it focused on my core it was a big
core<00:03:27.209> emphasis<00:03:27.630> now<00:03:28.530> if<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.610> pre<00:03:29.880> fatigue<00:03:30.240> all

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
core emphasis now if I pre fatigue all

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.510 
core emphasis now if I pre fatigue all
those<00:03:30.540> muscles<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.200> then<00:03:31.410> do<00:03:31.980> an<00:03:32.100> exercise

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
those muscles and then do an exercise

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.730 
those muscles and then do an exercise
that's<00:03:32.580> harder<00:03:33.150> than<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.330> previous<00:03:33.720> one<00:03:33.930> it

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
that's harder than the previous one it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.380 
that's harder than the previous one it
actually<00:03:34.950> makes<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.490> task<00:03:35.760> even<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.270> much

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
actually makes that task even that much

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.750 
actually makes that task even that much
harder<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> lot<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.920> times<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.400> second

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
harder so a lot of times in the second

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.010 
harder so a lot of times in the second
half<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.120> day<00:03:39.240> when<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:39.510> start<00:03:39.750> getting<00:03:39.840> a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
half of the day when we start getting a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.680 
half of the day when we start getting a
little<00:03:40.050> fatigued<00:03:41.030> well<00:03:42.030> interesting<00:03:42.330> that

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
little fatigued well interesting that

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.790 
little fatigued well interesting that
usually<00:03:43.140> that's<00:03:43.320> where<00:03:43.470> most<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.740> the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
usually that's where most of the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.130 
usually that's where most of the
injuries<00:03:44.010> occur<00:03:44.400> when<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.510> slopes<00:03:45.780> people

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
injuries occur when on the slopes people

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.330 
injuries occur when on the slopes people
start<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.470> get<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.650> bit<00:03:46.800> higher<00:03:47.100> and

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
start to get a little bit higher and

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.130 
start to get a little bit higher and
you're<00:03:47.910> still<00:03:48.120> pushing<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.050> going

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
you're still pushing is so this is going

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.800 
you're still pushing is so this is going
to<00:03:49.200> transfer<00:03:49.830> really<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.430> nicely<00:03:50.810> giving

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
to transfer really really nicely giving
