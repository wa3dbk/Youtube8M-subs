 can see in the title I will be 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.139
 doing a super casual day outfit 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.080
 because today is already night but I was 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.089
 during the day that I went shopping with 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.259
 my family and that I feel weird like that 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.710
 summer 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.480
 anyway I'm going to show you what I have 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.640
 is super casual because I was 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.540
 stores all day and I wanted to be 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.880
 I have some like a teacher but 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.100
 it's light feeling show is like 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.019
 lucky and I like it a lot because they are 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.539
 well versatile I have a lot of this 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.179
 kind of shirts that are like teacher 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.730
 as well as that I released appointments I bought it in 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.890
 true a long time ago and it's black 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.629
 always as you can see I have these 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.679
 pants that also buy them if 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.749
 you are and they are or these are what I did because 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.230
 these pants were not like that they were from 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.230
 broad leg 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.989
 and I wanted it short of facts are 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 highways test but I have big no 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.320
 I know if you can see that they are big 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.390
 then I have to put them on as well as 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.070
 that loose cited presupposes that they go more 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.770
 up and that I was more adjusted this 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.909
 but I 'm going to fix it later but 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.130
 I'm not putting it like that because I 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.659
 like how I also have left so 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.970
