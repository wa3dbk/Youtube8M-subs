today's<00:00:09.980> tutorial<00:00:10.190> will<00:00:10.820> be<00:00:10.850> about<00:00:10.970> data

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
today's tutorial will be about data

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.380 
today's tutorial will be about data
logging<00:00:11.750> on<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.230> kestrel<00:00:12.590> 4000<00:00:13.220> series<00:00:13.400> data
