00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.100
 Fill the empty spaces to complete the equation. 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.550
 Thus, we have 76 830, equal to 6 decimals 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.640
 plus [empty space] thousands plus 8 hundreds plus 3 tens. 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.130
 Let's think of 76 830. 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:28.020
 If we write 76 830 - I do it in different colors. 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.250
 We can record that as 70,000 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.810
 plus 6000-7 is the figure of ten thousandths. 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.510
 So, 7 tens of thousands, which is 70,000, plus - 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.842
 6 is the number of thousands, so that's it 

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:50.760
 6,000 or 6,000 plus 800. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.481
 Or we can say 8 hundreds. 

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:59.800
 800 plus 3 at 10, or 30. 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.680
 Then there are 0 units so we can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.050
 to write this as 0 if we want to. 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.249
 This here on the right is almost the same as 

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.042
 what they have written here on the right. 

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.670
 They have missed the scratch, 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.160
 so we can miss it too. 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.380
 Zero does not really affect the value. 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.155
 We have 3 tens. 

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.740
 We have 3 tens. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.340
 We have... 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.950
 Let me paint here to see. 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.280
 We have 8 hundred. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.260
 We have 800. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.500
 But here we have to think a bit. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.010
 There are an unknown number of thousands, 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.400
 here we have 6,000. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.413
 So we'll have to think a little here. 

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:35.010
 And then it comes to six tens of thousands, which is 60,000. 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.035
 Here we have 70,000. 

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:43.210
 So we have to work on these two places here. 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.070
 They have 6 tens of thousands, which is the same as 60,000. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.690
 And we have 70,000. 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.860
 That is, they actually took 10,000 from here 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.314
 and regrouped them elsewhere. 

00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:53.980
 And since these two places are equal, 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.188
 must have regrouped the thousands. 

00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:57.430
 Let's try to do it. 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.710
 We get 10,000 out of 70,000. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.480
 There are 60,000 left. 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.790
 So it happens 6. 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.190
 And then here we regroup at the place of the thousands. 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.320
 That is, we add 10,000 to the thousands. 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.560
 How many thousands then? 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.140
 Well, 10,000 plus 6,000. 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.830
 There will be 16,000. 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 This is going to happen here. 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.000
 So now the writing here looks exactly like this, 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.490
 which they gave us up here. 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.780
 These are six decimals plus 16 thousand 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.250
 plus eight hundred plus three tenths. 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.110
 And we're ready.
