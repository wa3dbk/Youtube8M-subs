have my own idea though so this is how
it<00:00:34.950> worked<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:37.340> DFT<00:00:38.340> by<00:00:38.520> moving<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.969> ivy<00:00:39.329> now

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it worked out DFT by moving to ivy now

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
it worked out DFT by moving to ivy now
we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> ability<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:41.520> feedback

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
from a simple big board presence to a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
from a simple big board presence to a
community<00:00:47.370> site<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.690> guys<00:00:48.930> are
