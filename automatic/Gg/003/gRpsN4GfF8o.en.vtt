00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
outer or something but generally I'm

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.610 
outer or something but generally I'm
using<00:00:40.880> my<00:00:41.090> key<00:00:41.300> points<00:00:41.690> from<00:00:41.810> the<00:00:41.900> Dicers<00:00:42.350> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
using my key points from the Dicers and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.290 
using my key points from the Dicers and
then<00:00:42.980> I<00:00:43.010> used<00:00:43.310> my<00:00:43.900> DDJ<00:00:44.900> sp1<00:00:46.090> throughout<00:00:47.090> that

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
then I used my DDJ sp1 throughout that

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.630 
then I used my DDJ sp1 throughout that
control<00:00:47.750> nothing<00:00:48.620> into<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.160> whole<00:00:49.280> effects

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
control nothing into the whole effects

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.430 
control nothing into the whole effects
think<00:00:49.910> there's<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.180> lot<00:00:50.330> of<00:00:50.450> times<00:00:50.660> for<00:00:50.900> me<00:00:51.080> echo

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
think there's a lot of times for me echo

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.500 
think there's a lot of times for me echo
flanger<00:00:52.160> maybe<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.460> little<00:00:52.580> bit<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:52.850> reverb<00:00:53.000> and

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
flanger maybe a little bit of reverb and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.230 
flanger maybe a little bit of reverb and
I'm<00:00:54.050> good<00:00:54.320> cuz<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:55.070> tend<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.640> think<00:00:55.820> less<00:00:56.060> is

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
I'm good cuz I tend to think less is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.560 
I'm good cuz I tend to think less is
more<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.440> that's<00:00:57.680> just<00:00:57.890> kind<00:00:58.130> of<00:00:58.370> that's<00:00:59.330> my

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
more but that's just kind of that's my

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.350 
more but that's just kind of that's my
workflow<00:00:59.990> and<00:01:00.760> someone<00:01:01.760> was<00:01:01.880> asking<00:01:02.000> about

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
workflow and someone was asking about

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.630 
workflow and someone was asking about
the<00:01:02.510> DJ<00:01:02.780> sp1<00:01:03.560> and<00:01:03.890> really<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:06.640> no

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
the DJ sp1 and really that is no

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.680 
the DJ sp1 and really that is no
different<00:01:08.140> than<00:01:09.140> what<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:16.270> Dicers<00:01:17.270> provides

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
different than what the Dicers provides

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:26.110 
different than what the Dicers provides
sim<00:01:18.020> for<00:01:18.410> controls<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.610> after<00:01:25.790> going<00:01:25.970> over

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
sim for controls of so after going over

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.400 
sim for controls of so after going over
to<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.300> hot<00:01:26.450> cue<00:01:26.750> same<00:01:27.140> thing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.980 

and<00:01:30.410> then<00:01:31.270> did<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:34.120> yeah<00:01:35.120> of<00:01:35.240> course<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
and then did that yeah of course the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.290 
and then did that yeah of course the
library<00:01:36.440> control<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.220> Denon<00:01:37.550> using<00:01:38.120> the

library control with the Denon using the
scroll<00:01:38.600> button<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.200> can<00:01:39.850> shift<00:01:40.850> back<00:01:41.060> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
scroll button and you can shift back and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.470

forth<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.720> can<00:01:41.750> love<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> or<00:01:42.650> be<00:01:42.830> all<00:01:43.610> that

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
forth you can love to a or be all that

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
the sp1 is pretty much the same as what

you<00:02:43.850> would<00:02:44.660> expect<00:02:45.050> from<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:47.739> very

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
you would expect from that it is a very

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.460 
you would expect from that it is a very
very<00:02:50.270> good<00:02:50.480> controller<00:02:50.959> it's<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.260> little

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
very good controller it's a little

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800 
very good controller it's a little
expensive<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.310> that's<00:02:53.120> that's<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.600> kind<00:02:53.780> of

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
expensive but that's that's just kind of

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.240 
expensive but that's that's just kind of
what<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.260> mean<00:02:54.590> you're<00:02:54.709> paying<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
what it is I mean you're paying for the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.699 
what it is I mean you're paying for the
Pioneer<00:02:55.640> name<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.870> definitely<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.530> same

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
Pioneer name it definitely the same

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.940 
Pioneer name it definitely the same

they show up inside of Serato and set

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.710 
they show up inside of Serato and set

actually<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:12.019> fine<00:03:12.200> because<00:03:12.470> now<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:12.769> think

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
actually it's fine because now I think

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.979 
actually it's fine because now I think
about<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:14.030> doesn't<00:03:14.390> show<00:03:14.570> in<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.750> MIDI

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
about it it doesn't show in the MIDI

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.750 
about it it doesn't show in the MIDI
device<00:03:15.320> list<00:03:15.680> but<00:03:16.250> they're<00:03:16.430> definitely

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
device list but they're definitely

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.940 
device list but they're definitely
natively<00:03:17.450> supported<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:18.910> based<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.950> I'm

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
natively supported so based on that I'm

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.770 
natively supported so based on that I'm
sure<00:03:22.160> what's<00:03:22.489> sailing<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.120> guess<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.450> can<00:03:23.570> map

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
sure what's sailing I guess you can map

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.350 
sure what's sailing I guess you can map
your<00:03:23.989> own<00:03:24.110> stuff<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.470> they<00:03:25.400> don't<00:03:25.700> show<00:03:26.090> in

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
your own stuff but they don't show in

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.100 
your own stuff but they don't show in
the<00:03:26.480> list<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.650> I'm<00:03:27.890> again<00:03:28.400> I'm<00:03:28.430> using

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the big thing with the velocity on the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.940 
the big thing with the velocity on the
sampler<00:03:34.270> pad<00:03:36.780> when<00:03:37.780> velocity<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.440> enabled<00:03:38.860> we

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
sampler pad when velocity is enabled we

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.590 
sampler pad when velocity is enabled we
hold<00:03:39.130> shift<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.670> press<00:03:39.700> velocities<00:03:40.390> at<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
sampler six samples six sample decks so

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.420 
sampler six samples six sample decks so
the<00:03:46.780> harder<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.260> hit<00:03:47.320> it<00:03:50.160> their<00:03:51.160> turn

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the harder you hit it their turn

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:14.820 
the harder you hit it their turn
velocity<00:03:51.910> off<00:03:54.060> if<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.180> have<00:03:55.300> a<00:03:55.360> velocity<00:04:13.830> it's

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
velocity off if you have a velocity it's

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.600 
velocity off if you have a velocity it's
good<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:15.880> there<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.270> have<00:04:16.330> it<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:17.290> Denon<00:04:17.770> HC

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
good so there you have it the Denon HC

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.520
