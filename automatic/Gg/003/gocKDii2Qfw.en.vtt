hello well I can either solder it that's

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.590 
hello well I can either solder it that's
my<00:03:25.290> main<00:03:26.290> idea<00:03:26.530> or<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.489> kind<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.910> like<00:03:28.090> tangle

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
my main idea or just kind of like tangle

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.040 
my main idea or just kind of like tangle
it<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.840> there<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:30.180> noticed<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.330> because<00:03:31.390> when<00:03:31.959> I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
it in there I noticed it because when I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.830 
it in there I noticed it because when I
first<00:03:32.260> wired<00:03:32.590> him<00:03:32.769> up<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.100> date<00:03:34.090> didn't<00:03:34.600> work

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
first wired him up I date didn't work

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.570 
first wired him up I date didn't work
and<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.200> thought<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.410> was<00:03:35.560> wiring<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.190> wrong<00:03:36.430> with

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
and I thought I was wiring it wrong with

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.790 
and I thought I was wiring it wrong with
something<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.680> then

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
something and then

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.370 
something and then
would<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.580> shook<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:39.940> or<00:03:40.840> try<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.110> again

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
would I just shook it or try it again

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.870 
would I just shook it or try it again
and<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:42.280> worked

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
and it worked

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.540 
and it worked
so<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.390> heard<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.930> tapping<00:03:44.860> noise<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.310> it's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
so I heard like a tapping noise and it's

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.270 
so I heard like a tapping noise and it's
too<00:03:45.790> late<00:03:45.940> why<00:03:46.120> were<00:03:46.270> hating<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.720> come

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
too late why were hating to come

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.510 
too late why were hating to come
so<00:03:48.280> yeah<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.380> think<00:03:50.860> I'm<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:51.040> gonna<00:03:51.160> fix

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
so yeah I'm I think I'm just gonna fix

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.040 
so yeah I'm I think I'm just gonna fix
it<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.730> think<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:52.060> too<00:03:52.180> much<00:03:52.330> hassle<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.870> get<00:03:52.990> a

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
it I think it's too much hassle to get a

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.370 
it I think it's too much hassle to get a
