make<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> Polish<00:01:39.780> last<00:01:40.020> longer<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.350> she's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
make the Polish last longer so she's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.940 
make the Polish last longer so she's
kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.920> any<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.280> gel<00:01:41.490> manicure<00:01:42.950> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
kind of like any like a gel manicure so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.080 
kind of like any like a gel manicure so
I<00:01:43.979> picked<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:44.970> was

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I picked this up and I think it was

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.219 
I picked this up and I think it was
$5.99<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:46.880> Sally's<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> paid<00:01:48.509> whatever<00:01:48.780> like

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
$5.99 at Sally's so I paid whatever like

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.690 
$5.99 at Sally's so I paid whatever like
ninety<00:01:49.590> nine<00:01:49.710> cents<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.520> well<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
ninety nine cents and then some well I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.090 
ninety nine cents and then some well I
bought<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:50.970> other<00:01:51.060> things<00:01:51.299> too<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.979> it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
bought some other things too but so it's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.569 
bought some other things too but so it's
$5.99

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
$5.99

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.690 
$5.99
I<00:01:53.670> believe<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.600> 39<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:56.399> went

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
I believe I think it was 39 and I went

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
I believe I think it was 39 and I went
home<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.030> tried<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.509> tried<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> couple

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
home and I tried it and I tried a couple

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
home and I tried it and I tried a couple
different<00:01:58.200> ways<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.009> first<00:01:59.040> time<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.430> tried<00:01:59.670> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
different ways the first time I tried it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.490 
different ways the first time I tried it
I<00:01:59.969> used<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.630> instruction<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> instruction

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
I used the instruction the instruction

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.240 
I used the instruction the instruction
said<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.610> paint<00:02:03.540> your<00:02:03.950> natural<00:02:04.950> nail<00:02:05.100> your

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
said to paint your natural nail your

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.609 
said to paint your natural nail your
bare<00:02:05.520> nail<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.170> coats<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.500> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
bare nail with one or two coats of this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
bare nail with one or two coats of this
and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> nail<00:02:09.179> polish<00:02:09.330> on

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
and then you can put a nail polish on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.809 
and then you can put a nail polish on
top<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.050> once<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.470> dry<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.340> tried<00:02:11.730> it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
top of that once it's dry so I tried it

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.070 
top of that once it's dry so I tried it
that<00:02:11.940> way<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> first<00:02:12.360> time<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that way the first time and it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.810 
that way the first time and it
didn't<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.500> very<00:02:13.530> much<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:14.100> didn't<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.460> didn't

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
didn't do very much it didn't I didn't

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.710 
didn't do very much it didn't I didn't
feel<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.120> strengthening<00:02:15.480> my<00:02:15.600> name

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
feel like it was strengthening my name

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.090 
feel like it was strengthening my name
is<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:15.930> much<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.500> wasn't<00:02:16.680> really<00:02:16.860> making

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
is very much and it wasn't really making

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.490 
is very much and it wasn't really making
a<00:02:17.310> nail<00:02:17.430> polish<00:02:17.580> last<00:02:18.240> longer<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.230> then<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> was

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
a nail polish last longer so then I was

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.870 
a nail polish last longer so then I was
like<00:02:19.590> okay<00:02:19.770> well<00:02:19.890> maybe<00:02:19.950> I'll<00:02:20.370> try<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:20.850> a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
like okay well maybe I'll try it as a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.580 
like okay well maybe I'll try it as a
topcoat<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.480> doesn't<00:02:21.750> say<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.080> can<00:02:22.290> but

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
topcoat it doesn't say that you can but

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
topcoat it doesn't say that you can but
I<00:02:22.890> mean<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.430> clear<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.910> what<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.090> you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
I mean it's clear like what are you

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.240 
I mean it's clear like what are you
gonna<00:02:24.240> do<00:02:24.360> maybe<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.170> said<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.650> figured<00:02:25.950> maybe<00:02:26.100> if

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
gonna do maybe I said I figured maybe if

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
gonna do maybe I said I figured maybe if
I<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.970> gel<00:02:27.180> layer<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.510> top

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
I you know put like a gel layer on top

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.100 
I you know put like a gel layer on top
of<00:02:27.810> my<00:02:28.020> nail<00:02:28.200> polish<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> would<00:02:28.770> stay<00:02:28.950> longer

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
of my nail polish it would stay longer

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.170 
of my nail polish it would stay longer
and<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.100> tried<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.580> way<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.910> mean<00:02:33.060> it's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and so I tried that way and I mean it's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.430 
and so I tried that way and I mean it's
good<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.510> good<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> topcoat<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.230> worked

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
good it's good as the topcoat it worked

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500 
good it's good as the topcoat it worked
but<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.100> still<00:02:35.640> didn't<00:02:35.850> make<00:02:35.940> my<00:02:36.090> nail<00:02:36.210> polish

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
but it still didn't make my nail polish

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.200 
but it still didn't make my nail polish
lasts<00:02:36.750> any<00:02:37.170> longer<00:02:37.310> um<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.000> was<00:02:39.030> not

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
lasts any longer um but it was not

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.580 
lasts any longer um but it was not
robust<00:02:39.630> because<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.930> mean<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.140> wasn't<00:02:40.290> doing

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
robust because I mean it wasn't doing

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.110 
robust because I mean it wasn't doing
anything<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:41.100> another<00:02:41.340> topcoat<00:02:41.820> wasn't

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
anything that another topcoat wasn't

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.420 
anything that another topcoat wasn't
doing<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.960> then<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.070> know<00:02:44.160> let<00:02:44.370> me

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
coat with maybe that'll work maybe it'll

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.000
