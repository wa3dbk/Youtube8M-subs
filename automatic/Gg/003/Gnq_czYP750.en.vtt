sew two pieces of fabric together so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:50.840 
sew two pieces of fabric together so
we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.450> again<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:49.850> there

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
we're going to do that again and there

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this mess that you're going to have to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
this mess that you're going to have to
deal<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.769> one<00:01:04.769> way<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:10.070> well

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
deal with one way or the other well

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.059 
deal with one way or the other well
there<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.780> different<00:01:13.439> ways<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.920> doing<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
there are different ways of doing that

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:23.529 
there are different ways of doing that
one<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.469> take<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> lighter<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
one is that you can take a lighter and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:30.039 
one is that you can take a lighter and
you<00:01:24.539> can<00:01:24.749> sear<00:01:25.759> all<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.090> those<00:01:27.240> threads<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
you can sear all of those threads but I

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.609 
you can sear all of those threads but I
mean<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:32.249> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> take<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.170> only

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
mean you really want to take the only

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.319 
mean you really want to take the only
one<00:01:34.770> getting<00:01:35.189> involved<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.109> kind<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
one getting involved in that kind of

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:50.100 
one getting involved in that kind of
yeah<00:01:42.049> whoa<00:01:43.969> whoo

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.920 

not<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.100> best<00:01:51.670> idea<00:01:52.090> I've<00:01:52.990> ever<00:01:53.020> had<00:01:57.480> and<00:01:58.480> set

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
not the best idea I've ever had and set

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.050 
not the best idea I've ever had and set
the<00:01:59.110> machine<00:01:59.940> for<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.000> zig-zag<00:02:01.450> stitch<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
the machine for a zig-zag stitch and you

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:29.210 
the machine for a zig-zag stitch and you
can<00:02:04.270> go<00:02:04.480> over<00:02:04.810> those<00:02:04.990> raw<00:02:05.380> edges<00:02:24.959> but<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:28.150> know

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
can go over those raw edges but you know

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.930 
can go over those raw edges but you know
that's<00:02:30.220> not<00:02:30.580> real<00:02:30.970> pretty<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:33.340> still<00:02:33.610> kind

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
that's not real pretty it's still kind

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.660 
that's not real pretty it's still kind
of<00:02:34.060> ugly<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.280> still<00:02:36.610> going<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.000> fray<00:02:37.270> now

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
of ugly and it's still going to fray now

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.440 
of ugly and it's still going to fray now
professional<00:02:39.870> swords<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:42.640> come<00:02:42.970> up<00:02:43.180> with<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
professional swords have come up with a

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.510 
professional swords have come up with a
solution<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.209> what's<00:02:47.050> called

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
solution and that is what's called

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.860 
solution and that is what's called
pinking<00:02:48.520> shears<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:51.550> can<00:02:51.790> cut<00:02:52.540> that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
pinking shears and you can cut that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:08.640 
pinking shears and you can cut that
extra<00:02:53.620> fabric<00:02:53.860> off<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.360> pinking<00:02:58.840> shears

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.300 

and<00:03:09.650> now<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:11.120> will<00:03:11.360> revel<00:03:14.020> there<00:03:15.020> is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
and now you will revel there is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.050 
and now you will revel there is
something<00:03:16.310> else<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:16.910> we<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:17.660> do<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:19.060> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
something else that we can do and that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:29.100 
something else that we can do and that
is<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:22.300> we<00:03:23.300> can<00:03:23.540> cut<00:03:23.960> that<00:03:24.310> extra<00:03:25.310> fabric<00:03:25.580> off

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.070 

that<00:03:30.110> way<00:03:30.410> there<00:03:31.340> won't<00:03:31.580> be<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.910> whole<00:03:32.360> lot<00:03:32.390> to

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
that way there won't be a whole lot to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.650 
that way there won't be a whole lot to
Ravel

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.450 

so<00:03:41.260> we'll<00:03:41.560> cut<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.100> extra<00:03:42.640> fabric<00:03:42.940> off<00:03:44.460> down

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
so we'll cut that extra fabric off down

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.650 
so we'll cut that extra fabric off down
to<00:03:45.910> 0<00:03:46.740> about<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.770> quarter<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.340> an<00:03:48.610> inch<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:49.270> where

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
to 0 about a quarter of an inch of where

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.610 
to 0 about a quarter of an inch of where
that<00:03:49.870> seam<00:03:50.260> line<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.840> turn<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.320> inside

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
that seam line is you turn that inside

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:10.650 
that seam line is you turn that inside
out<00:03:58.800> then<00:04:02.940> let's<00:04:03.960> stitch<00:04:04.960> it<00:04:05.400> again<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.760> will

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
out then let's stitch it again and will

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:21.300 
out then let's stitch it again and will
stitch<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:13.740> so<00:04:14.740> that<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.940> miss<00:04:19.420> we<00:04:20.410> will<00:04:20.950> stitch

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
stitch it so that we miss we will stitch

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.840 
stitch it so that we miss we will stitch
it<00:04:22.080> right<00:04:23.220> along<00:04:24.780> where<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:25.990> cut<00:04:26.430> but<00:04:27.430> we'll<00:04:27.610> do

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
it right along where we cut but we'll do

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.180 
it right along where we cut but we'll do
it<00:04:27.910> with<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> straight<00:04:28.450> stitch<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:29.620> fix<00:04:29.980> it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
it with a straight stitch to fix it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:05:06.559 
it with a straight stitch to fix it
right<00:04:30.400> across<00:04:30.700> Europe<00:04:31.210> right<00:04:31.480> along

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.609 

and<00:05:07.169> now<00:05:07.580> let's<00:05:08.580> turn<00:05:08.849> it<00:05:09.029> inside<00:05:09.509> out<00:05:10.550> again

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:12.619 
and now let's turn it inside out again

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:18.589 
and now let's turn it inside out again
look<00:05:13.619> at<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:15.830> look<00:05:16.830> at<00:05:17.009> that<00:05:17.240> we've<00:05:18.240> got<00:05:18.569> a

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
look at that look at that we've got a

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:27.139 
look at that look at that we've got a
clean<00:05:19.249> seam<00:05:20.249> on<00:05:21.709> this<00:05:22.709> side<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:25.169> then<00:05:26.039> on<00:05:26.339> the

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:27.149 
clean seam on this side and then on the

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:34.579 
clean seam on this side and then on the
inside<00:05:29.869> everything<00:05:30.869> is<00:05:31.229> all<00:05:32.659> caught<00:05:33.659> up<00:05:33.990> and

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
inside everything is all caught up and

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:41.149 
inside everything is all caught up and
bound<00:05:34.949> off<00:05:35.279> and<00:05:35.759> it<00:05:36.509> can<00:05:36.869> travel<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:40.159> is

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
bound off and it can travel that is

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:47.529 
bound off and it can travel that is
called<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:42.740> French<00:05:43.789> seam<00:05:44.959> and<00:05:46.309> it<00:05:47.309> was

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
called a French seam and it was

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.540 
called a French seam and it was
developed<00:05:48.889> just<00:05:49.889> exactly<00:05:50.749> for<00:05:51.749> this<00:05:51.779> purpose

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
developed just exactly for this purpose

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.709 
developed just exactly for this purpose
to<00:05:53.550> have<00:05:53.759> a<00:05:53.789> nice<00:05:54.419> clean<00:05:57.349> team<00:05:58.349> on<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.860> outside

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
to have a nice clean team on the outside

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.549 
to have a nice clean team on the outside
and<00:06:00.719> that<00:06:01.019> little<00:06:01.589> binder<00:06:02.629> binding<00:06:03.629> rich<00:06:03.930> on

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:04.559 
and that little binder binding rich on

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:10.870 
and that little binder binding rich on
the<00:06:05.189> inside

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:23.400
