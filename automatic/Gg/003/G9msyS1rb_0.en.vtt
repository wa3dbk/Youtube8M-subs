00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
like like I said earlier I like the C

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.869 
like like I said earlier I like the C
shape<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.030> use<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.420> here<00:02:52.720> contour<00:02:53.409> gauge

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.039 

see<00:02:57.879> it's<00:02:58.000> looking<00:02:58.269> nice<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.599> round<00:02:58.840> just

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
see it's looking nice and round just

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.940 
see it's looking nice and round just
like<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.409> C<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:01.510> you've<00:03:01.690> got<00:03:01.840> C<00:03:02.170> shapes<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.769> got

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
like a C now you've got C shapes you got

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.660 
like a C now you've got C shapes you got
D<00:03:03.190> shapes<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.660> C<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.080> lot<00:03:05.319> more<00:03:05.500> rounded<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
D shapes the C is a lot more rounded the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.880 
D shapes the C is a lot more rounded the
D<00:03:06.849> is<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> little<00:03:07.330> bit<00:03:07.420> flatter<00:03:07.720> at<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.530> bottom

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
D is a little bit flatter at the bottom

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.550 
D is a little bit flatter at the bottom
you<00:03:09.519> can<00:03:09.549> also<00:03:09.700> go<00:03:10.150> with<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.330> V<00:03:10.660> like<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.379> used

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
you can also go with a V like they used

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.449 
you can also go with a V like they used
to<00:03:11.709> do<00:03:11.829> in<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.010> 50s<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.760> old-school<00:03:13.379> V<00:03:14.459> check

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
to do in the 50s the old-school V check

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.600 
to do in the 50s the old-school V check
and<00:03:15.700> see<00:03:15.849> where<00:03:16.000> I'm<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:16.299> it's<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.049> great<00:03:17.260> guide

contour<00:03:18.610> gauge<00:03:19.590> yeah<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:22.030> got<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.239> lot<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.599> we

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
contour gauge yeah we got a lot of we

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.930 
contour gauge yeah we got a lot of we
got<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.870> lot<00:03:23.049> of<00:03:23.079> meat<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.349> remove<00:03:23.829> here<00:03:24.099> to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
got a lot of meat to remove here to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.250 
got a lot of meat to remove here to
bring<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.239> down<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.510> where<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.840> want<00:03:26.079> it<00:03:26.200> so
