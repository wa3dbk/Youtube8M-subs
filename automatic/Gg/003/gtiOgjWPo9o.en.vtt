 Hello everyone and welcome to products 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.500
 home and family I am Lorraine and today we are going to 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.650
 prepare a multi-use disinfectant 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.599
 very economical home and easy to prepare 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.289
 for the preparation of our 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.370
 disinfectant we will need 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.940
 hot water baking soda 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.390
 liquid soap 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.480
 vinegar alcohol antiseptic aroma and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.000
 vegetable dye as a first step let's go 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 to dilute the sodium bicarbonate in the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 hot water then let's add the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
 vinegar in small quantities to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
 prevent the mixture from overflowing 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.000
 recipient as you can notice the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.489
 baking soda and vinegar have a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.340
 chemical reaction once we have 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 finished adding the vinegar let's 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 place the antiseptic alcohol and then 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.800
 we are going to place the liquid soap of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.170
 any kind can be soap shampoo 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.509
 for hands 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 soap to wash clothes any soap 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.580
 liquid that you have at home what 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.520
 can you add in this case I'm 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.030
 using a little bit of shampoo that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.979
 we had prepared in previous videos 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.470
 If you want to know how to prepare yourself a little 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 I leave the link at the end of 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.860
 this video and finally we're going to place 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.380
 the vegetable dye that is optional and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.520
 the aroma I have chosen a pretty aroma 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.920
 strong to eliminate the smell of vinegar 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.770
 but they can use to replace the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 essential oils once we have 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.409
 mixed all the ingredients we have 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.470
 our ready-made multi-use disinfectant 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.780
 to be used this disinfectant is not 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.259
 recommended for cleaning wooden floors 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.869
 nor marble surfaces well that has 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.049
