00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.210
 damn thefts is nice to know 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.669
 nowadays dogs are considered members of the family 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.559
 although they have helped humans with specific jobs for millennia 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 the dogs live harmoniously alongside people many times as the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.570
 man's best friends the status of family member but may require 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.630
 that a dog follows certain patterns of behavior but how they are 

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:29.730
 animals with their own habits this requires that their owners chess train to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.879
 that they behave appropriately in human society 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.039
 in fact it is a conditioning the move happened in the certain box 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:38.789
 tasks 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.639
 the title that we want it to do to the main commands a 

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:48.040
 in the question of obedience, his set sits down and someone 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 the canine training being thus the operant conditioning 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.650
 the first scientist to define this concept was frederic skinner who 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.910
 studied the work of the physiologist course doctor ivan todorovic on the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.370
 animal behavior 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.120
 the revolutionary study of dread dogs learned that a stimulus in the case 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.740
 teaching meant it was time to get food starting with saliva and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 ate two things that are naturally associated with the return of his 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.350
 new third component when ringing the bell before the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.310
 after some tests the dogs learned to associate the signal with the act of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
 were fed and began to salivate at the sound of the bell predicting the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.690
 presence of the race even though I was not there at that time as the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.430
 dogs naturally salivate when receiving food the commendation is a non-stimulus 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.289
 conditioning is not necessary special extranet conditioning ' 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.230
 to make the dog salivate by the commendation what is an unconditioned response 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.910
 on the other hand the ringing bell does not usually cause the felipe dogs 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.920
 it is necessary to condition them to associate the siena with the act of being 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.500
 fed so the simÃ£o is a conditioned stimulus to new reaction 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 of the dog is a reflex to the stimulus or is a conditioned response the face 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.240
 thefts explains how canine dressage works want to know more
