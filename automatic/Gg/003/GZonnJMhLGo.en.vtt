00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.310
 The trouble to use once is hearty soft 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.200

 Coloring agent 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.400
 Yellow paint 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.450
 Is it yellow 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.450

 Toothpick tooth brush is a brush 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.140
 Woodworking bond 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.020

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.300
 As much as possible, Kato is after Alice's number of whey and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 Such as rose pattern 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.220
 I think that it is good to prepare 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.730
 First of all hearty software 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.580
 We measure with spoonful 1 honorable old spoon 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.980
 With yellow spirits 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.840
 Yellow has been comfortable with coloring 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.380
 If you can color it, you can color it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.380
 To cup 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.720
 I will paint the bond with 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.260
 First to become 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.250
 I do not put a bond in the bottom of the box 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.429
 If you do 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.429
 With a toothpick not let toothbrush with a toothbrush 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.090
 I will try to go around the whole

 50 first there part 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.379
 Riding in the overall 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.569
 It could be spread out 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.569
 Now the problem with the parts around 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.170
 Of around 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.330
 While thinking of a cut 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.330
 I think that it is good to put in slowly 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.569
 When you do, parts around 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.079

 Main hall if we go over 4 or more 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.780
 Because the bond will stick out when you put the dough 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.700
 Minutes to paint 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.140
