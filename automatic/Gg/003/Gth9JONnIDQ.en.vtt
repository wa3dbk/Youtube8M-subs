00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 who russia already comes across inevitably 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 on those little yellow tankers the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 stand almost at every street corner 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 Here you can find something under 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 the Russian thirst quencher directly from 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.900
 the source tap 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 in moscow alone in summer will be far 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.619
 over a million liters of light 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.660
 alcoholic but healthy bitten out 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.260
 bread consumed and in the trade 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.540
 brought 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.430
 the production is then in the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.500
 breweries at hundreds hectoliters per 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 Day 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.100
 in the light of the summer heat shows 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.430
 russia tv how to make this delicious 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.039
 drink at home can produce 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 the basis for quaas is dry bread 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.309
 We will prepare this in thin slices 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.399
 cut in the oven at medium 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.410
 heat until it hurts the reported 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.719
 bread slices we crumble in now 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 big container and pour over 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.930
 boiling water 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.270
 the amount depends on the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.420
 amount in liters ultimately needed 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 We shall let our approach be 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 now covered for about 24 hours 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.500
 Then we add yeast in sugar 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.930
 attached as well as a mini branch 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.509
 to represent the whole thing to go twelve 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.490
 hours in a warm place actually 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.100
 our quasi almost finished 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 but admittedly he sees something else 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.229
 unappetizing that's why we saw the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.060
 liquid and clarify so from the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.560
 ingredients 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 Now we feel it in bottles 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 and give each one some most bern or 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 optionally raisins with 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.000
 However, they should be the bottles for the time being 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 not close too tight yet 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.520
 since the circle honored now is only 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.649
 still a little patience asked and after 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 a rest of four days at one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.729
 Well chilled art then just stays with us 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.729
 still a midsummer big 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.190
 there
