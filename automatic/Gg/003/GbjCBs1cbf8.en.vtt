00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.740
 the new ford focus it is a real one 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.220
 athlete with his performance 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.509
 values ​​of his traction and steering precision 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.759
 he asks further from exotic 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.649
 automobiles out pretty big words 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.930
 by ford in the press release look 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.040
 We'll do fluff on the cheek 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.040
 want to paint or it's true 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.289
 305 ps and 440 newton meters he had 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.309
 to offer 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.200
 quite a robe for one 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.350
 front-wheel drive 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.520
 the first impression of the new ford focus 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.930
 it puts all this here 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.150
 crazy number that is not this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.740
 Expected front scratches at the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.740
 accelerate out licking out 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.930
 but that it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.700
 great story 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.740
 usually that front wheel drive 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 theme is always so close comes from the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.800
 corner out is all about a lot 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.220
 goes in smoke on this classic 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.229
 understeer that at least here on 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.620
 not to the French maritime Alps 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.620
 feel 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.850
 so that the 19 inches at the front 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.520
 Do not dissolve in smoke, there's friwo 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.680
 knuckles a front axle like in wrc 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.330
 rallye focus combines the whole 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 with a mechanical locking differential 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.010
 The thing goes to Frau Strauss is a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.170
 that's just fine for that 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.510
 feedback for the bike has something of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.930
 me is Triebler to grip level at mc 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.100
 it then the per meter but not in shape 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 of spinning wheels 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.230
 if she gets really cubic then that will do 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.780
 a fun thing 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.390
 in combination with the chassis the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.550
 Soundscape of the gas going to the tourbus 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.780
 Expresses in the corner and again ans 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.780
 gas occupied car 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.710
 I will now nothing 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.750
 say because I 'm just now 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.310
 drive beauty was the thing here 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.310
 beat down nice 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.300
 the rs does not just look like one 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:38.250
 relict from long forgotten times he 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.250
 Sounds like saying something 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.909
 now just have to listen again 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.909
 gas 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.230
 a car can be 100 200 300 kilometers 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.230
 drive and only gas again and again 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.690
 it is just sooo cool so cool 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.690
 you just have to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.650
 40 years old means that he already is 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.040
 By the way, for all sports and has one 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.830
 Damn long story behind this 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.580
 it all started 1970 starts ford 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.720
 with the escort rs 1600 in rally sport 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.750
 and is also on the race track 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.480
 successful in 1973, the export appears 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.450
 as rs road version homologation 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.520
 model for the rally-wm rs200 with 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.950
 mid-engine and 370 ps 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.400
 The cosworth came in the early nineties 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.799
 with a thick wing 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.959
 discreetly and rarely from the first focus rs 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.959
 arise 4,500 copies 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.160
 the explosiveness is also at 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.540
 latest rs model ford only 1000 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.980
 Cars are for the German market 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.900
 its price determined 33,900 euros for it 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.970
 you get a bit in the injection 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.800
 spaces doped athlete the turbo 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.569
 but does not need epo but air 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.269
 That's why the mouth of the focus is wide 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.220
 torn 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.419
 a full 5 cm is the focus tank sill 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.419
 Doping has gone wide 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.090
 the wing provides the necessary 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.940
 contact pressure at 263 km / h peak 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.130
 inside normal series up to the 280 km h 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.480
 Thanks to retarus, you have enough speed 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.800
 page stop for the daily 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:45.090
 Special exam hall sports in view 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.979
 plugged 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.800
 ford has been in rallying for 40 years 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.550
 active in 2007 they are for the last time 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.550
 become world champion 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:08.050
 are you sure 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:09.340
 The car has a volume which is ps 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.259
 but factory drivers before the rally 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.490
 World Cup and if that one 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.180
 can drive with it he has 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.490
 At least if a passenger Mikko 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.169
 Hirvonen from Finland is up-to-date 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.479
 second in the rallye-wm behind the 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.479
 French loeb his car a focus wrc 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:33.029
 nico how much rallye is in really 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.619
 in the new focus rs a whole lot 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.389
 Just have a look at the car from 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:38.429
 outside I mean the back of the big one 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.729
 spoiler and the responsiveness of the 

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.729
 motors 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.749
 if you have the car here with ours 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.639
 rallyauto compares so the 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.819
 Driving characteristics on asphalt are very 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.819
 similar 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.180
 okay I'll do the rallye 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.860
 Let's write down now, too 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.870
 Rally pace and then we look 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:09.370
 times whether the letter puts look if 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.730
 you still come with me after I say 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.730
 D rather not 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.990
 You should say something all the time 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.580
 nico we have to think like here 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.610
 Do that as a rally driver that is 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:47.300
 damn tight but you know you're going 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:52.509
 freedom enough so if so 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.509
 Driver around incredibly wide enough 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.250
 nico you drive really good but let 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.080
 tell us about the rally 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.979
 What about sebastian loeb? 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.979
 Do you want to beat him this year 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:15.990
 I do not want to talk about that 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.990
 probably the wrong topic patrick 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:23.080
 the initial question was the ford focus 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:24.639
 He is an athlete and hello you have 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.059
 the pictures are not seen the thing is 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.949
 an absolute thoroughbred athlete 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.380
 Thoroughbred also exists in addition to poison green 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:34.840
 white and blue 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.490
 The car makes so much bunk driving 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.050
 that now 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.289
 simply nothing more just to say a 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:45.300
 let a few meters burn properly 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:45.300
 april then everyone can burn
