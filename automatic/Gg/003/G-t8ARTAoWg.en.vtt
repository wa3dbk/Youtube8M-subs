bit so that gives you an idea of what

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.509 
bit so that gives you an idea of what
they<00:00:24.660> look<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:24.960> installed<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.070> installed

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
they look like installed I installed

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
they look like installed I installed
them<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:27.599> low<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.019> possible<00:00:30.500> without

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
them as low as possible without

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
them as low as possible without
interfering<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.450> Cobra<00:00:35.480> dragster<00:00:36.480> pipes

here that gives you an idea

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.670 
here that gives you an idea
I<00:00:39.420> guess<00:00:39.690> I'll<00:00:39.840> walk<00:00:39.960> over<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> um<00:00:49.020> we'll

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
I guess I'll walk over here so um we'll

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.540 
I guess I'll walk over here so um we'll
get<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.160> closer<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
get in a little closer here and that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
get in a little closer here and that
gives<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.110> see

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
gives you I don't know if you can see

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.069 
gives you I don't know if you can see
inside<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.489> um<00:00:57.180> let<00:00:57.989> me<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.410> here

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
inside there at all um let me see here

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.939 
inside there at all um let me see here
gives<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> an<00:01:01.829> idea<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:03.710> what's<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gives you some of an idea of what's in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.929 
gives you some of an idea of what's in
there<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:08.340> fairly<00:01:09.650> fairly<00:01:10.650> thin<00:01:11.280> feeling

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there it's fairly fairly thin feeling

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.780 
there it's fairly fairly thin feeling
plastic<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.720> mean<00:01:12.869> everything<00:01:13.170> feels

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
plastic I mean everything feels

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.100 
plastic I mean everything feels
relatively<00:01:14.790> cheaply<00:01:15.060> made<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> mean<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
relatively cheaply made that I mean it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.899 
relatively cheaply made that I mean it
is<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.460> $300<00:01:18.180> saddlebag<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.170> 200<00:01:19.909> 200

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
is you know a $300 saddlebag or 200 200

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.429 
is you know a $300 saddlebag or 200 200
some<00:01:21.119> odd<00:01:21.210> dollars<00:01:21.420> saddlebag

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
some odd dollars saddlebag

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.550 
some odd dollars saddlebag
um<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.610> mounted<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.030> pretty<00:01:24.540> nicely<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.170> think

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
um they mounted up pretty nicely I think

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.899 
um they mounted up pretty nicely I think
it<00:01:26.369> took<00:01:26.610> me<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:28.020> couple<00:01:28.710> hours<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> get

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it took me a couple hours I think to get

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
it took me a couple hours I think to get
everything<00:01:30.180> mounted<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> wanted<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
everything mounted but I wanted to you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700 
everything mounted but I wanted to you
know<00:01:32.540> make<00:01:33.540> sure<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:33.900> measurements<00:01:34.590> were

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
know make sure all my measurements were

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.700 
know make sure all my measurements were
correct<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.189> got<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.900> pretty<00:01:36.900> close<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
correct I got them pretty close to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.550 
correct I got them pretty close to
identical<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.549> both<00:01:38.579> sides<00:01:39.090> mom<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.350> comes

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
identical on both sides mom and it comes

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
identical on both sides mom and it comes
with<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:41.180> mounting<00:01:42.180> brackets<00:01:42.659> which

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
with these mounting brackets which

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.740 
with these mounting brackets which
aren't<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> best<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:45.329> worked<00:01:45.540> pretty

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
aren't the best but it worked pretty

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.830 
aren't the best but it worked pretty
well<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.759> figured<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> price<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> bags

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
well I figured for the price of the bags

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.429 
well I figured for the price of the bags
what<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> heck<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.509> worth<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.869> shot

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
what the heck it was worth a shot

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.429 
what the heck it was worth a shot
can<00:01:52.860> always<00:01:53.070> replace<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.549> later<00:01:54.350> there's<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
can always replace them later there's a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
can always replace them later there's a
shot<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> back<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.399> bike<00:01:56.689> I'll<00:01:57.689> get

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
shot of the back of the bike I'll get

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.100 
shot of the back of the bike I'll get
that<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.049> focus<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:59.689> then<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> gives<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that and focus there then it gives you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
that and focus there then it gives you
an<00:02:01.200> idea<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> looks<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:04.939> don't

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
an idea what that looks like I don't

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
an idea what that looks like I don't
know<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.329> should<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.600> showing<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:06.990> license

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
know if I should be showing my license

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
know if I should be showing my license
plate<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.590> guess<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> good<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> find

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
plate I guess it's a good way to find

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.420 
plate I guess it's a good way to find
out<00:02:09.959> who<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.229> really

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
out who I really

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.160 
out who I really
suppose<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.700> gives<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.180> an<00:02:14.269> idea<00:02:14.360> overall

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
suppose that gives you an idea overall

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.690 
suppose that gives you an idea overall
I'm<00:02:15.260> pretty<00:02:15.349> happy<00:02:15.500> I've<00:02:15.860> only<00:02:16.010> ridden<00:02:16.340> for
