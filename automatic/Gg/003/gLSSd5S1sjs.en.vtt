 not very often abroad young people 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.770
 who come to us and who come 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.789
 discover our culture our young and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.189
 then our our organizations 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.630
 among the present nations the china and 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.360
 Taiwan did not fail in their 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.220
 reputation far above the lot 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.170
 the two Asian countries have left 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.880
 that crumbs to their opponents and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.799
 especially in the team classification 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 where as well as among girls that 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.450
 in boys the republic of china 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.399
 took the titles but France has 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.899
 does better than resist by taking the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.000
 third place among boys in 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.880
 national team as well as the ain la 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.170
 competition schools of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.780
 good results in a discipline 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.000
 more commonly known as ping pong and 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.379
 which remains very technical it's not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.819
 vulgar in the ping pong because as soon 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.500
 that we leave the borders of France and 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.750
 from the French intellectual milieu we want 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 to say absolutely table tennis we speak 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.170
 than ping abroad we speak ping 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.310
 in chemistry by ping it's a word 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.170
 international ping has 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.420
 international we want a little bit 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.680
 make it a little bit more 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 intellectuals have table tennis 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 like that but it's something that 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 brings our young people together and who really is 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 a sport that is practiced on all 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.100
 continents 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.319
 unfortunately he shows us 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.489
 continuing from south america we 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.450
 lack in Africa too for this 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.150
 fully sense of it's really a 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.310
 success but we managed to gather a 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.109
 clearly the world's best in 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.450
 the act in the discipline beautiful event 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.459
 so these global unss that was 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.910
