00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
 and personal beauty is another video of the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.589
 channel fotolog studio 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.949
 This video is very special, I'll be there. 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.310
 talking about the best of the best the best 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.099
 fixed lens of what is to 24 millimeters 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:36.840
 with 1.4 l 2 mr 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:40.410
 here it is a very big lens for 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.390
 she so the construction is excellent is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.379
 totally made of metal 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 what is it like to be jealous she has undressed? 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.920
 rubber back here and it's very curious 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.670
 also this rear element of it 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 well great element for it to have its 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.930
 1.4 is the very large element and has to 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.490
 be very careful also when you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.140
 mounted on the wrong body because 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 this is very expensive 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 so let's go to situations like this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.880
 lens has three elements in ten minutes 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.189
 two of them being the Felix and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.770
 two ultra low dispersed elements or 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.850
 be just those elements to correct 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 to chromatic aberrations on the lens has 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 a lot of things to talk about her so she is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.530
 a very good lens 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.210
 lit 1.4 help this lens excellent 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.450
 that I will tell you if you 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.420
 have been made even though they are not 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.390
 croke this lens is more versatile 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 more than one frame the quality of it and the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.570
 sharpness is more noticeable 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 I used a marriage with these 24 1.4 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.540
 it was pretty much the same when using 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.390
 50 mm slightly smaller than the cut 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.119
 it's a concept but it's still pretty good anyway 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.259
 this lens then if you are in 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.620
 a frame 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.470
 she is very good because I go 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.200
 very good and the quality also the sharpness 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.099
 1.4 itself is very good 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.739
 I'm going to post a picture for you, beautiful and 1.4 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.060
 and also the sharpness of it testing in f 18 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.370
 ef 11 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.790
 is it gets the photos to the side 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.790
 you will see 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.180
 a lot of good is simply that she 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.099
 lightweight it weighs approximately 600 grams 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.849
 in my 3 she is worried 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.580
 on the front that points to why the 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.200
 as it gives 13 p is well levinho am 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.000
 recording now with so then 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.709
 Did not show very well. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.220
 and another very good thing her sm she 24 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:10.540
 1.4 books a very large opening but 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.079
 it is not a slow SM like 85.2 that it 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.660
 died well for kassin and I found him well 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.319
 smart even if she has a little 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.609
 slow it can have a quality of 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.609
 very good focus 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.520
 is well stamped even on the five of 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.280
 also known to have a slow focus 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.740
 She is very fast even in the seven of then. 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.350
 Do not even talk too fast even though 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.050
 The sec is already a camera but it was the sporting 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.720
 where it would only do if used in the 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.180
 advertisement at night to do sportline 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.830
 You also have a picture near your 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.140
 subject is very good that this 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.590
 brightness ensures great photos with 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.200
 quality and may also decrease because 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.310
 you will not pass 1.4 on high 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.120
 speed plus or minus 250 and 125 so 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.239
 say 3,200 so can I speak to 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.370
 You're the lens, that's it, folks. 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.940
 So what with her pictures? 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.940
 bye
