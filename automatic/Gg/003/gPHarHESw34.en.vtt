00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
mine is going to be made out of stone

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.990 
mine is going to be made out of stone
and<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.830> big<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.730> wide

and it can be as big as you want as wide
this<00:00:54.300> way<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.830> far<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.190> 10<00:00:57.030> blocks<00:00:57.270> or<00:00:57.570> 11

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
this way and as far as 10 blocks or 11

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.009 
this way and as far as 10 blocks or 11
blocks<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> those<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.839> then<00:01:00.839> you're

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
blocks at one of those and then you're

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.030 
blocks at one of those and then you're
going<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.170> place<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.379> sticky<00:01:01.710> pistons

going to place your sticky pistons

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.460 
going to place your sticky pistons
facing<00:01:02.460> inside<00:01:02.580> again<00:01:03.030> except<00:01:03.900> for<00:01:04.050> one<00:01:04.230> block

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
facing inside again except for one block

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.780 
facing inside again except for one block
away<00:01:05.390> now<00:01:06.390> let's<00:01:06.750> dig<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.409> i'm<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
away now let's dig it out i'm going to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
away now let's dig it out i'm going to
use<00:01:10.430> worldedit<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:13.250> because<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.460> much

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
use worldedit for this because it's much

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.140 
use worldedit for this because it's much
much<00:01:15.120> easier<00:01:16.370> let's<00:01:17.370> let's<00:01:17.610> take<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.909> out

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
much easier let's let's take this out

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
much easier let's let's take this out
and<00:01:21.320> now<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.440> you're<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.800> do<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> find

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and now what you're going to do is find

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.520 
and now what you're going to do is find
where<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.000> pistons<00:01:24.390> are<00:01:24.890> place<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.130> block

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
where your pistons are place a block

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.170 
where your pistons are place a block
like<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.800> almost<00:01:29.010> diagonal<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.969> and<00:01:32.180> then

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
like that almost diagonal of it and then

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
like that almost diagonal of it and then
place<00:01:33.630> redstone<00:01:33.899> torches<00:01:34.820> facing<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:37.189> mean

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
place redstone torches facing in I mean

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.899 
place redstone torches facing in I mean
facing<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.380> below<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.860> piston<00:01:41.549> if

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
facing just right below the piston if

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
facing just right below the piston if
that<00:01:42.090> makes<00:01:42.299> sense<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> same<00:01:44.009> on

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that makes sense and then do the same on

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.709 
that makes sense and then do the same on
the<00:01:44.369> other<00:01:44.399> side

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.059 

now<00:01:52.719> connect<00:01:53.439> these<00:01:53.679> two<00:01:54.069> together<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:56.069> place

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
now connect these two together and place

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:05.010 
now connect these two together and place
redstone<00:01:57.670> all<00:01:58.149> around<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:04.630> what<00:02:04.869> you're

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
redstone all around now what you're

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.580 
redstone all around now what you're
going<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.229> need<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.499> do<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.799> connect<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.579> so<00:02:07.590> go

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
going to need to do is connect it so go

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.170 
going to need to do is connect it so go
one<00:02:09.099> away<00:02:10.030> from<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:12.459> block<00:02:12.670> away<00:02:12.730> from<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
one away from it one block away from the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
one away from it one block away from the
torch<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.280> place<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:15.489> glowstone<00:02:15.910> an<00:02:16.180> odd

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
torch and place your glowstone an odd

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.479 
torch and place your glowstone an odd
diagonal<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.360> zigzag<00:02:19.930> like<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.769> then

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
diagonal or a zigzag like that and then

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.839 
diagonal or a zigzag like that and then
now<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.530> because<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:27.280> stone<00:02:27.519> can<00:02:27.700> go

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
now like this because that stone can go

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.930 
now like this because that stone can go
through<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.150> place<00:02:29.110> your<00:02:29.319> redstone<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:30.280> top<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
through it place your redstone on top of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.520 
through it place your redstone on top of
all<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> glow<00:02:31.329> stone<00:02:31.540> blocks<00:02:34.769> like<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
all the glow stone blocks like this and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.699 
all the glow stone blocks like this and
down<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.310> same<00:02:39.579> below<00:02:41.160> now<00:02:42.160> let's<00:02:43.440> put<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
down the same below now let's put the

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.930 
down the same below now let's put the
court<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.519> blocks<00:02:45.819> right<00:02:46.030> here<00:02:47.609> place<00:02:48.609> your

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
court the blocks right here place your

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.369 
court the blocks right here place your
redstone<00:02:49.690> right<00:02:49.959> there<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:52.200> then<00:02:53.200> you're

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
redstone right there and then you're

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.309 
redstone right there and then you're
going<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> same<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.280> other<00:02:54.310> side

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
going to do the same on the other side

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.070 
going to do the same on the other side
now<00:02:56.319> let's<00:02:56.889> do<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.519> again

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.020
