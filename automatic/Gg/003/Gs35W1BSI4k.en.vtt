00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.550
 Hello friends with you and you and 921 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.699
 american premium heavy tank 8 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.019
 level m 6 and 21 so it is called 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.019
 probably unfortunately only 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.539
 chess players who are there and 2 and 4 give 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.089
 all the other guys call him a goose 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.279
 so here on the streets of ensk and indeed in 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.620
 the whole street of this tank has arrived 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 finally his feast in patch 93 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 developers took and apnuli promised 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 promised and finally finally on the street not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.039
 priority drivers are very rare 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.100
 prem tank m60 one finally happened 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.890
 terrible changed not god knows how 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 of course, but much more generally added 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 he does not have the right to lower his bar 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 the level of fighting now he stepped into the camp 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 premium or waterman who fall 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.429
 only in the eight and nine but only in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 these battles are more accurate than in these but in this 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.860
 in top only in top top guest 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 feels like a heavy tank here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.800
 typical scene I met let's say so 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 ordinary masoderzhaschayuschie in guy 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.140
 opposite him and dissecting him such as 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 times places where all frontal armor 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 our goose one millimeter will fall 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.840
 with you the minimum increase my 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
 thanks to being able to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 thanks to the absent about how different 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.530
 tilting it feels like it 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.230
 as it is less well that is 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.480
 rolling it in patch 93 i really 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.060
 I felt that a third of cases when you 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.850
 just closed my eyes and waited when 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.990
 end this nightmare called fight 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.170
 10 levels where well 1 well two well three times from 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 strength even on somebody's homework and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.440
 dismember just offensively and generally in 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.120
 All places hurt because 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.300
 armor penetration tiny again 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.480
 I repeat level 10 overexposure is very 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.400
 microsdhc takes 32 long 10 seconds 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.909
 you need to wait until the charge stand projectile but 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.520
 incredible she has here 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.960
 felt like the past way 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.149
 again about all these technical details 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.069
 I even made a separate video here on 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.989
 he is obliged to reference you 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.030
 see if you have not seen before well 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.920
 in this video although you explain 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.709
 tell explain what you are now 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.239
 feelings about the clipped level here 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.480
 you only get to the eight to 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.299
 what became nines was what 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.849
 if earlier we guilt the geese suffered in two 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.879
 thirds of cases, well, that is, as there 66 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.310
 percent and 66 ad infinitum 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.810
 now in 50 percent of cases we suffer 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.910
 because still fighting with nines 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.829
 nothing good does 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.590
 We meet and if in front of any 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.500
 let's say stronger e75 or less 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.260
 strong but also quite good for example t-54 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.390
 the fact that what the other fuck grandmother 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.060
 punch there only with gold and even then 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.819
 lucky but Golda shoot certainly it 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.730
 the machines are much better than this goose then 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.940
 I still have misery 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.220
 although the whole mass has become less 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.220
 16 percent if so here decompose 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.620
 mathematically burn subjectively less 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.190
 gone still i find it there 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.130
 worst among all right in level 8 and 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.829
 it's just that it's probably even categorical 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.079
 but he has no armor for serious 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.200
 he has no armor for the third 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.849
 in the forehead where not at all in the tower but 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.370
 Only in the mask but see what size 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.980
 this mask around she is surrounded by armor 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.200
 towers that breaks through with all sorts of different 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.930
 he has no armor options 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.620
 vs french mx-5 table vs 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.040
 any good tyazha pestechki eighth 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.109
 level and beta just the trouble here is 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.329
 feeling that he has become of course a likeness 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.950
 so that's how apt-5 if thats even more 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.040
 less strong but he knows that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.109
 turret with a radio operator ahead riding 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.120
 is such a tidbit for 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.639
 the rest here he is whole and tasty 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.620
 a piece and the same no 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.410
 mobility is the same no armor 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.290
 boards by the way is also a separate song for 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.000
 a goose that does not allow him to tank 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.100
 diamond because it is worth only 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.840
 turn up the opponent diamond and you 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.269
 substitute your 40 min 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.010
 board which makes its way with any 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.370
 surrounded by the layouts of whatever there 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.799
 was 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.750
 the projectile is charged in short this tank 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.880
 so here it is one of those rare, like 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.520
 like is-7 when his diamond does not put 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.010
 need acne here but only forehead but how am I 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.860
 you have already explained a hundred times 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.960
 loose short friends if 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.040
 the day will come when wargaming will start 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.830
 sell goose 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.010
 my advice to you is to take care of yourself from this 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.050
 if you do not save the deal at least 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.479
 pay with a titanium chair to a 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.370
 maybe at least a titanium plate 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.590
 so as not to burn your chair in through 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.900
 boida every fight because she 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.630
 still he is very slow he is very 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.190
 loose and big and like someone can 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.560
 seem like I'm pumping up 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.880
 and again some strange mood 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.550
 biased staying pipe if you are pro 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.130
 armor damage take fcm if you 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.720
 need speed and armor so take out 6 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.490
 if you need anything else 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.910
 consider any other options 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.530
 but the goose does not climb into any gate 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.720
 Perhaps he of course and farms on bebashki 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.180
 and this is probably its integral part but 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.100
 there is a whole lot more comfortable 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.550
 options here's the thing 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.560
 that is, about some kind of pleasure 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.850
 associated with the farm here for sure I 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.570
 I can not put any 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.110
 interconnection 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.660
 really suffering suffering even perhaps 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.520
 but not even this is probably the only fight 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.130
 happened in the evening when we are there and 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.280
 catalyst on this geese single fight 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.289
 where at least something could be shown 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.180
 but this is how I evolved 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.729
 circumstances that just me allies 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.349
 left here and the warrior left the Spaniard 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.639
 what 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.169
 to knock with them for more 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.560
 case guaranteed to master there 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.860
 waited 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.020
 in short his friends certainly apnuli 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.630
 good is it definitely good 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.419
 Do I think it is enough? 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.919
 enough because still 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.840
 uncomfortable car but a little less 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.490
 percentage of cases and everything is on it 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.810
 actually thanks for watching 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.800
 subscribe to my channel to new 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.800
 See you all for now
