you<00:04:54.090> traveling<00:04:54.570> because<00:04:54.660> it's<00:04:54.870> not<00:04:55.050> liquid<00:04:55.380> so

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
you traveling because it's not liquid so

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.560 
you traveling because it's not liquid so
it<00:04:56.190> doesn't<00:04:56.340> take<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> lot<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.820> space<00:04:57.210> out<00:04:57.420> but

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
it doesn't take a lot of space out but

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.960 
it doesn't take a lot of space out but
you<00:04:57.630> have<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.900> worry<00:04:58.080> about<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.470> 311<00:04:58.860> role<00:04:59.280> but

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
you have to worry about the 311 role but

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.720 
you have to worry about the 311 role but
actually<00:05:00.840> this<00:05:01.290> one<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:01.830> much<00:05:01.980> better<00:05:02.160> it

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
actually this one is so much better it

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.850 
actually this one is so much better it
is<00:05:02.820> more<00:05:03.000> pricey<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.540> course<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.140> I<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.620> feel

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
is more pricey of course but I just feel

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.160 
is more pricey of course but I just feel
like<00:05:05.100> it<00:05:05.400> works<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.330> actually<00:05:06.600> does<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.810> job

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
like it works that actually does the job

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.200 
like it works that actually does the job
it<00:05:07.770> doesn't<00:05:08.040> give<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.220> as<00:05:08.310> much<00:05:08.430> volume<00:05:08.700> that

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
it doesn't give you as much volume that

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.180 
it doesn't give you as much volume that
one<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.660> used<00:05:09.930> more<00:05:10.170> for<00:05:10.350> volume<00:05:10.740> than<00:05:10.980> just

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190
