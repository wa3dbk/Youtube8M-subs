me as a person and an artist and I think

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.460 
me as a person and an artist and I think
it's<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:54.089> helped<00:00:54.330> me<00:00:54.480> grow<00:00:55.019> into

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
it's really helped me grow into

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.500 
it's really helped me grow into
something<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.610> would<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> never<00:00:57.150> become

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
something that I would have never become

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.070 
something that I would have never become
if<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.080> stayed<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.710> Texas<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> east<00:01:03.720> side<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
if I stayed in in Texas the east side is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.479 
if I stayed in in Texas the east side is
very<00:01:04.350> therapeutic<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.339> it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
very therapeutic and I think it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
very therapeutic and I think it's
because<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.390> much<00:01:06.510> life<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.110> plant

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
because there is so much life here plant

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.090 
because there is so much life here plant
life<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.130> animal<00:01:08.850> life<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:10.620> that's<00:01:10.830> one

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
life on animal life and that that's one

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
life on animal life and that that's one
of<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.280> things<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.940> really<00:01:12.360> love<00:01:12.510> about
