on<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
on then you have a

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.699 
on then you have a
your<00:02:13.239> headphone<00:02:13.629> jack<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.290> nice

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
your headphone jack right there nice

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.119 
your headphone jack right there nice
he'll<00:02:15.370> cut<00:02:15.670> out<00:02:15.819> right<00:02:16.000> there<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:17.590> think

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
he'll cut out right there and I think

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.130 
he'll cut out right there and I think
they<00:02:18.400> did<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> very<00:02:18.849> good<00:02:18.970> job<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.540> obviously

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
they did a very good job but obviously

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.000 
they did a very good job but obviously
like<00:02:20.440> most<00:02:20.680> phone<00:02:21.040> cases<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:23.010> stereo

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
like most phone cases that the stereo

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.949 
like most phone cases that the stereo
jacks<00:02:24.280> won't<00:02:24.550> fit<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.090> there<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.269> mean<00:02:25.569> like

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
jacks won't fit in there I mean like

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.869 
jacks won't fit in there I mean like
your<00:02:26.140> big<00:02:26.349> DJ<00:02:26.620> headphones<00:02:27.190> those<00:02:27.610> don't<00:02:27.819> fit

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
your big DJ headphones those don't fit

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.309 
your big DJ headphones those don't fit
in<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.459> sensor<00:02:30.459> then<00:02:30.970> you're<00:02:31.360> this

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
in here and then sensor then you're this

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.770 
in here and then sensor then you're this
since<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> cutouts<00:02:33.760> bigger<00:02:34.060> right<00:02:34.269> here<00:02:34.540> it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
since the cutouts bigger right here it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.339 
since the cutouts bigger right here it's
compatible<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.860> iPhone<00:02:36.310> 4<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.730> 4s

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4s

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.930 
compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4s
since<00:02:38.349> another<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.860> us<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.519> right<00:02:39.730> there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
since another for us is like right there

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.309 
since another for us is like right there
and<00:02:40.180> then<00:02:40.900> easy<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.860> press<00:02:42.129> for<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.489> volume

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and then easy to press for the volume

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.199 
and then easy to press for the volume
then<00:02:44.319> at<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.590> bottom<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.190> guess<00:02:45.549> some<00:02:45.910> docs

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
then at the bottom I guess some docs

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.960 
then at the bottom I guess some docs
might<00:02:46.720> not<00:02:46.959> work<00:02:47.200> with<00:02:47.380> this<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:48.370> since<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.849> is

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
might not work with this but since it is

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.569 
might not work with this but since it is
very<00:02:49.269> thin<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:50.140> silicone<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.040> guess<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.459> might

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
very thin the silicone I guess it might

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.250 
very thin the silicone I guess it might
work<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.940> don't<00:02:52.180> really<00:02:52.299> have<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.569> doc<00:02:52.870> right<00:02:53.110> now

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
work I don't really have a doc right now

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.940 
work I don't really have a doc right now
because<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.370> just<00:02:54.430> got<00:02:54.760> my<00:02:54.880> iphone<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.739> yep<00:02:56.739> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
because I just got my iphone so yep and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.690 
because I just got my iphone so yep and
then<00:02:57.130> nice<00:02:57.670> cutouts<00:02:58.180> for<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.450> speakers<00:02:58.900> and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
then nice cutouts for the speakers and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.520 
then nice cutouts for the speakers and
now<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.030> camera<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.989> camera<00:03:02.200> does

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
now to the camera the camera does

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.650 
now to the camera the camera does
doesn't<00:03:03.459> really<00:03:03.790> have<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> problem<00:03:04.299> with<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
doesn't really have a problem with the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.589 
doesn't really have a problem with the
flashback<00:03:05.610> sometimes<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.849> does<00:03:07.030> since<00:03:07.360> I

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
flashback sometimes it does since I

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.289 
flashback sometimes it does since I
guess<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.290> could<00:03:08.440> see<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.829> it's<00:03:09.760> sort<00:03:10.180> of

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
guess if you could see that it's sort of

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.729 
guess if you could see that it's sort of
thick<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.829> my<00:03:12.099> flashes<00:03:12.940> were<00:03:13.269> just

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
thick and so my flashes were just

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.809 
thick and so my flashes were just
sometimes<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.950> works<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.280> sometimes<00:03:15.370> it

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
sometimes it works and sometimes it

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.690 
sometimes it works and sometimes it
don't<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:17.040> don't<00:03:18.040> know<00:03:18.130> how<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> explain

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
don't like I don't know how to explain

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.410 
don't like I don't know how to explain
it<00:03:18.790> really<00:03:19.299> but<00:03:20.459> yeah<00:03:21.459> it's<00:03:21.489> pretty<00:03:21.910> good<00:03:22.180> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
it really but yeah it's pretty good and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140 
it really but yeah it's pretty good and
then<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.769> also<00:03:24.010> has<00:03:24.340> pretty<00:03:24.670> good<00:03:24.850> drop

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
then it also has pretty good drop

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.240 
then it also has pretty good drop
protection<00:03:25.389> I'll<00:03:26.109> get<00:03:26.500> start<00:03:26.859> off<00:03:26.980> with<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
protection I'll get start off with the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.340 
protection I'll get start off with the
good<00:03:27.370> things<00:03:27.579> about<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.940> case<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:28.389> very<00:03:29.139> good

good things about this case as very good

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
case is that my stepmom actually has the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.440 
case is that my stepmom actually has the
same<00:03:44.109> case<00:03:44.350> but<00:03:44.590> she<00:03:44.739> added<00:03:44.859> in<00:03:45.069> pink<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.579> the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
same case but she added in pink and the

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.479 
same case but she added in pink and the
silicone<00:03:46.959> case<00:03:47.200> whenever<00:03:47.410> she<00:03:47.739> put<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.220> it

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
silicone case whenever she put it on it

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.819 
silicone case whenever she put it on it
kind<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.269> ripped<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.959> silicone<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.590> mean<00:03:50.739> the

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
kind of ripped the silicone I mean the

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.559 
kind of ripped the silicone I mean the
hard<00:03:51.040> case<00:03:51.250> ownership<00:03:51.609> at<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.940> hard<00:03:52.150> part<00:03:52.389> on

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
hard case ownership at the hard part on

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.309 
hard case ownership at the hard part on
the<00:03:53.470> silicon<00:03:53.950> ripped<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.959> she<00:03:55.959> had<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.170> get<00:03:56.290> a

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
the silicon ripped and she had to get a

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.819 
the silicon ripped and she had to get a
new<00:03:56.349> one<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.700> was<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.209> downside<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.410> but

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
new one so that was a downside to it but

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.339 
new one so that was a downside to it but
overall<00:04:00.549> this<00:04:00.819> case<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.239> really<00:04:01.480> good<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.900> would

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
overall this case is really good I would

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.839 
overall this case is really good I would
highly<00:04:02.680> recommend<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:03.250> if<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.459> don't<00:04:03.579> want<00:04:03.670> to

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
highly recommend it if you don't want to

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.589 
highly recommend it if you don't want to
spend<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.239> much<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.750> case<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:06.209> yeah<00:04:07.209> so

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
spend that much on a case and yeah so

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.099 
spend that much on a case and yeah so
that's<00:04:08.319> it<00:04:08.500> for<00:04:08.560> this<00:04:08.829> review<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:10.109> incipio
