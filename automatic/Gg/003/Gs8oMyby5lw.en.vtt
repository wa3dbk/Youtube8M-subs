00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 it is not today that sedans please and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.850
 very much the Brazilian consumer may 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.730
 was why Ford decided 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.389
 extend the family of compact ka with 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.950
 three-volume body is the most expensive 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.900
 1.5 that the period now stands at 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.810
 test for you 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.020
 recalls the first generation of ford ka Ã© 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.130
 a daring drawing hatch and bring the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 chapada 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.650
 but in a country like Brazil where the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.929
 butt is national preference 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 the new car could not keep this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.989
 image has changed so much that it has 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.079
 rear of the body 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 sedan and a product in question is the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 the compact sedan that uses the same 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 new party platform 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 so let's see what he has more 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.440
 the sedan has the same front of the new hatch 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.989
 from which nothing is to do with the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 first car our all to do with the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 current family fucking lines 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.700
 is a sturdy-looking sedan that looks 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 small on the outside but inside not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.870
 disappoint in the space is ideal 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 for four occupants traveling with 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.270
 relative comfort but it's an ass that the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.220
 car that won will even cater to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.070
 Brazilian family yearnings 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.740
 because it's the trunk is not the biggest 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.440
 category but leads quietly to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.800
 a small family's luggage position 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.560
 is very good the controls are 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.710
 very well located facilitating the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.710
 access 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.660
 The suitcase or internal finish is made with 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.970
 good quality materials and 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.730
 panel instruments are easy to 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.740
 what comes most equipped with 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.710
 series with air-conditioning direction 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.670
 electric front power windows 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.030
 electric remote control locks 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.550
 my connection and system warning the samu 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.160
 in the event of an accident with 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.180
 air bags and fuel cut 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.100
 this version of the LS and LT line and point 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.230
 still electronic controls of 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.870
 stability and traction that guarantee 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.480
 more safety in curves and floors 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.960
 slippery departure assistant in 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.580
 ramp sync system and alloy wheels 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.340
 ring 15 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.610
 is a well equipped car and still comes with 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.520
 Efficient Mechanical Assembly Motor 1.5 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.190
 has good bearing at low rotations and 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.060
 guarantees good starts and resumes of 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.540
 velocity 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.880
 the exchange with soft and precise couplings 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.400
 it counts on marches well staggered everything 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.950
 to provide good performance and 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.380
 satisfactory fuel consumption 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.590
 suspensions ensure safety in 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.190
 curves but it leaves a car a little hard 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.050
 on uneven floors and the brakes 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.330
 acted efficiently 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.780
 But since everything is not perfect, I will. 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.510
 show now that the most income 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.480
 the steering wheel has height adjustment but 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.290
 is not set in distance on the door 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.720
 bags 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.840
 hawk hooks and nets to learn 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.110
 objects and feels the lack of finishing 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.790
 on the inside of the lid that looks like 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.470
 will collapse when closed without speaking 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.680
 that the rear parking sensor 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.720
 that is missing in the model like this and the 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.810
 electric mirrors 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.470
 are offered only as 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.470
 accessories 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.299
 it really is these are absences that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.819
 could have been avoided, right? 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.200
 but talking about prices the guy more starts 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.790
 with version s 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.980

 with engine 1.0 and 42.890 with 1.5 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.959
 already the sl version goes from forty-two 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.299

 myth to 47 thousand four hundred and ninety 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.789
 with 1.5 and only the notes that the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.489
 ideal for the car plus a newsletter 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.520
 balanced with a rainfall of 8 to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.710
 performance and safety and 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.100
 stability finish and internal space 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.860
 comfort bags won 17 and the bill was 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.889
 closed with an additional 18 for the cost 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.889
 benefit
