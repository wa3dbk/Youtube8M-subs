learned in this type of setting as you
can<00:00:13.860> tell<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> background<00:00:14.969> they're

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
can tell in the background they're

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.120 
can tell in the background they're
spinning<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:16.020> type<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.289> disaster<00:00:17.100> and

spinning some type of disaster and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.640 
spinning some type of disaster and
actually<00:00:17.670> what<00:00:17.880> happened<00:00:18.390> was<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> wood<00:00:19.410> pile

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
actually what happened was a wood pile

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
actually what happened was a wood pile
caught<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.189> fire<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.609> burned<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.300> wood<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
caught on fire and burned up wood and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.529 
caught on fire and burned up wood and
pots<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.830> bunch<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.130> other<00:00:23.340> materials<00:00:24.060> in

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
pots and a bunch of other materials in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
pots and a bunch of other materials in
doing<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.680> affected<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.340> tree<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
doing so it affected this tree it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.330 
doing so it affected this tree it
actually<00:00:27.480> burned<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.560> leaves<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:29.130> why

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
actually burned the leaves as why

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
actually burned the leaves as why
they're<00:00:29.519> crunchy<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.660> fall<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.529> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
they're crunchy this is not fall this is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
they're crunchy this is not fall this is
this<00:00:31.859> premature<00:00:32.460> aging<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> speak<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
this premature aging so to speak of the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500 
this premature aging so to speak of the
tree<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:35.340> most<00:00:35.550> people<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.329> this

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
tree now most people would look at this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
tree now most people would look at this
tree<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.230> automatically<00:00:38.040> assume<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
tree and just automatically assume it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.630 
tree and just automatically assume it
was<00:00:38.730> dead<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.390> level<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> ground<00:00:40.770> but

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
was dead and level it to the ground but

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
was dead and level it to the ground but
I'm<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> teach<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.540> sure<00:00:42.780> far<00:00:43.110> away

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
I'm going to teach you is sure far away

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.770 
I'm going to teach you is sure far away
to<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:44.010> your<00:00:44.460> tree<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> alive<00:00:45.360> whether

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to see if your tree is alive whether

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
to see if your tree is alive whether
it's<00:00:45.989> gone<00:00:46.170> through<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> disaster<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.340> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's gone through a disaster like this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.209 
it's gone through a disaster like this
or<00:00:47.969> whether<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.200> looking<00:00:49.530> sickly<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
or whether it's looking sickly and you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.010 
or whether it's looking sickly and you
want<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.640> parts<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> renew

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
want to see parts that you need to renew

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689 
want to see parts that you need to renew
that<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.350> dead<00:00:52.649> versus<00:00:53.070> parts<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> are

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that are dead versus parts that are

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.479 
that are dead versus parts that are
alive<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> easiest<00:00:55.410> way<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> tell<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
alive now the easiest way to tell if the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
alive now the easiest way to tell if the
tree<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.000> still<00:00:57.149> alive<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> scratch

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
tree is still alive is to do a scratch

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119 
tree is still alive is to do a scratch
test<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> consists<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.530> taking

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
test and what that consists of is taking

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.179 
test and what that consists of is taking
your<00:01:02.309> thumbnail<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.199> scraping<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> bark<00:01:04.619> now

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
your thumbnail and scraping the bark now

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
your thumbnail and scraping the bark now
this<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> Kirk<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> tree<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:06.840> doing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
this is a Kirk the tree and you're doing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.670 
this is a Kirk the tree and you're doing
it<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.409> small<00:01:07.830> areas<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.500> going

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it in small areas and you're just going

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.600 
it in small areas and you're just going
to<00:01:10.770> move<00:01:10.979> remove<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.420> top<00:01:12.689> layer<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.049> bark<00:01:13.619> if

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to move remove the top layer of bark if

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.179 
to move remove the top layer of bark if
it's<00:01:14.939> green<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.810> sometimes<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
it's green and sometimes it will be a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.060 
it's green and sometimes it will be a
really<00:01:17.460> bright<00:01:18.360> green<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.049> sometimes<00:01:19.860> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
really bright green and sometimes it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
really bright green and sometimes it
will<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.670> dull<00:01:20.970> green<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:22.110> means

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
will be more of a dull green that means

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
will be more of a dull green that means
the<00:01:22.560> tree<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.920> still<00:01:23.130> alive<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> dark

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the tree is still alive if it's a dark

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.950 
the tree is still alive if it's a dark
brown<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> tan<00:01:26.250> color<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.420> continue<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
brown or a tan color and you continue to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
brown or a tan color and you continue to
scratch<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> can't<00:01:29.100> find<00:01:29.460> any<00:01:29.820> green

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
scratch and you can't find any green

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.219 
scratch and you can't find any green
areas<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.110> means<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.680> branch<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.640> dead

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
areas that means that branch is dead

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
areas that means that branch is dead
before<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> take<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.799> any<00:01:35.130> tree<00:01:35.700> because

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
before you take down any tree because

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.899 
before you take down any tree because
trees<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.960> important<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> ecosystem

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
trees are so important to the ecosystem

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.370 
trees are so important to the ecosystem
make<00:01:38.909> sure<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> check<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.869> several

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
make sure that you check in several

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.160 
make sure that you check in several
locations<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.310> check<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> trunk<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.960> make

locations and check the trunk to make

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
locations and check the trunk to make
sure<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.649> yes<00:01:43.920> indeed<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.700> tree<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> dead

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
sure that yes indeed that tree is dead

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.110 
sure that yes indeed that tree is dead
before<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.350> remove<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.430> regardless<00:01:47.880> if

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
before you remove it so regardless if
