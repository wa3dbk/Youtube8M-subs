00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.019
 foot evidence do your thing a couple 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 use the parser before going on 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.369
 convince board to sail soar 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.009
 head over and keep you afloat 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.060
 remember those two things that help 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.390
 go to the board 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.989
 mast inclination to wind and increment 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.060
 lifting force when straightening the arms and 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:41.180
 closing the sail on while raising the sail 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.180
 need to let him pull you on the board 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.400
 with fresh wind you don't want to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.060
 sail pulled you into position over 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.250
 board 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.510
 carts are weighed in opposition to the outside 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.690
 let's see how we stand against thrust 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.650
 sail your chin up head thrown back 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.159
 from the sail the shoulders are far above the water and the body 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:10.189
 straight leg straight 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.189
 straightened and pushed against the force of the sail 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.479
 when leaving the water you want to sail 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:23.369
 dragged you you are not trying 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:26.579
 confront him you give in to him 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.729
 increase traction bend your back leg 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:35.280
 with 2 there is no body closer to the blackboard and you 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:40.259
 easier to lift stretch your arms and give geek 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.539
 rise high above your head it will give 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.359
 sail to gain more wind to lift 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.539
 put your chin down and bend at the waist 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:52.079
 forward with this body position a couple with 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.149
 easily raise you to the board if 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.590
 pull the boom down and lean back 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.969
 back then this sail task will be 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.969
 almost impossible 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.300
 with a light wind you have to take out 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.640
 sail maximum pull mother 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.990
 what is more to the wind and maximally 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.990
 lift the sail over the board 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.830
 light wind is needed completely 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.070
 straighten your front arm and more 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.150
 closing the sail it will turn the wind in 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.959
 large sail surface and take your time 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.330
 straighten with very little wind 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 it is important that the front hand is immediately 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 ahead from trapcode and this will help 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.470
 put the mother what's next ahead and right 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470
 above the board 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.610
 when you need big traction in the weak 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.920
 the wind guide the board more into the whip it 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.010
 will help the couple the essence of pulling more forward 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.049
 overdose waldos and will result 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.049
 catapult in the middle of the exit from the water 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:21.500
 such cleaning through the nose of the board ate completely 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.870
 not funny when leaving water in strong 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.330
 the wind bring the board more to the wind and 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.330
 make very careful movements of the sail 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.110
 this will allow him to gradually increase his cravings.
