nights at Freddy's 2 and it says

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.560

something<00:00:18.630> borrowed<00:00:19.080> something<00:00:19.439> new<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> I'm

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
something borrowed something new so I'm

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.810 
something borrowed something new so I'm
assuming<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.170> everything<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> outside

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
assuming that everything on the outside

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.240 
assuming that everything on the outside
is<00:00:24.269> new<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.960> they<00:00:25.140> ripped<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> mainframe

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
is new but they ripped out the mainframe

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.380 
is new but they ripped out the mainframe
from<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> original<00:00:26.970> body<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.330> they

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
from the original body and they

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.630 
from the original body and they
implement<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.349> into<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> new<00:00:28.949> body<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.490> it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
implement that into the new body so it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.630 
implement that into the new body so it's
basically<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> same<00:00:30.390> thing<00:00:31.369> just<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
basically the same thing just with a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060 
basically the same thing just with a
completely<00:00:33.390> different<00:00:33.570> exterior<00:00:34.170> shell<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
completely different exterior shell so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
completely different exterior shell so
but<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> core<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.760> still<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> same<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
but the core is still the same so you

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.840 
but the core is still the same so you
could<00:00:37.050> notice<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.469> lot<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> differences<00:00:38.399> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
could notice a lot of differences on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
could notice a lot of differences on
this<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.379> it's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> completely<00:00:40.710> different

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
this one it's a completely different

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
this one it's a completely different
color<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.600> resembles<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
color now and it actually resembles a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.600 
color now and it actually resembles a
bunny<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:43.620> although<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> looks<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:44.460> more

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
bunny now although it looks a bit more

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.569 
bunny now although it looks a bit more
childlike<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
childlike so as you can see there's a

childlike so as you can see there's a
white<00:00:47.760> belly<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.410> it's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.620> light<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
light shade of blue but the original

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.450 
light shade of blue but the original
bonnie<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:53.030> purple<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:55.110> sort<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> purplish

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
bonnie was purple and a sort of purplish

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.010 
bonnie was purple and a sort of purplish
/<00:00:56.850> white<00:00:57.300> shade<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.989> color<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> belly<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
as you can see the new bonnie has green

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560 
as you can see the new bonnie has green
eyes<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.979> some<00:01:04.979> red<00:01:05.159> cheeks<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.850> yeah<00:01:06.180> it's

version of a bunny I'm assuming - trying
to<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> more<00:01:12.030> kid-friendly<00:01:14.180> but<00:01:15.320> yeah<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to make it more kid-friendly but yeah I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289 
to make it more kid-friendly but yeah I
mean<00:01:16.500> since<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> grand<00:01:17.520> new<00:01:17.670> reopening

personally I think I like the design of
the<00:01:25.770> old<00:01:26.009> bonnie<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.369> a
