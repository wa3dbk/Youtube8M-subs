00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
mode it actually beats it now the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.970 
mode it actually beats it now the
durability<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.640> 10<00:00:53.969> off<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.860> opinion

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
durability is 10 off but in my opinion

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.639 
durability is 10 off but in my opinion
this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.520> definitely<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.809> best<00:00:58.410> type<00:00:58.620> of

and that will upgrade it so you know I
don't<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.470> they're<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
don't know if they're all going to be

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
don't know if they're all going to be
called<00:01:23.360> s31<00:01:24.360> v<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.080> depending<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.590> what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
called s31 v you know depending on what

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
called s31 v you know depending on what
the<00:01:25.799> sparrow<00:01:26.070> name<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> compare

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the sparrow name is but when you compare

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.580 
the sparrow name is but when you compare
it<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.470> better<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:30.299> definitely<00:01:30.960> think

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it it's better and I definitely think

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.520 
it it's better and I definitely think
that<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.009> better<00:01:32.189> because<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.500> have

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that it's better because it doesn't have

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
that it's better because it doesn't have
that<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:35.400> breaker<00:01:35.759> effect<00:01:36.299> where<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that time breaker effect where if you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.890 
that time breaker effect where if you
hold<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:38.520> boost<00:01:38.790> too<00:01:39.060> long<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.540> blows<00:01:39.869> up

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
hold in the boost too long it blows up

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
hold in the boost too long it blows up
because<00:01:40.500> i<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:40.979> me<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because i know for me that's really

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.780 
because i know for me that's really
annoying<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.070> only<00:01:44.250> faster

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
annoying and this one is not only faster

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
annoying and this one is not only faster
but<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> doesn't<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.630> which<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.409> great

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
but it doesn't have that which is great

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
but it doesn't have that which is great
and<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.149> pretty<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.509> everything<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and it's it's pretty much everything in

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
and it's it's pretty much everything in
a<00:01:49.229> sparrow<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
a sparrow you would want but there you
