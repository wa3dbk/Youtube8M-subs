00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
that I really like to do before I stand

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.870 
that I really like to do before I stand
before<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.380> do<00:02:14.440> any<00:02:14.650> kind<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.890> leg<00:02:15.040> movements<00:02:15.430> is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
before I do any kind of leg movements is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.050 
before I do any kind of leg movements is
to<00:02:16.329> loosen<00:02:16.630> up<00:02:16.780> my<00:02:17.260> quas<00:02:17.500> mighty<00:02:17.890> ban<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.610> see

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
to loosen up my quas mighty ban so I see

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.000 
to loosen up my quas mighty ban so I see
a<00:02:19.090> lot<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.269> people<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.599> gym<00:02:19.810> who<00:02:20.590> don't

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
a lot of people in the gym who don't

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.229 
a lot of people in the gym who don't
know<00:02:21.099> what<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.489> or<00:02:21.670> who<00:02:21.760> don't<00:02:21.880> use<00:02:22.090> this

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
know what this is or who don't use this

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.620 
know what this is or who don't use this
or<00:02:22.420> do<00:02:22.780> use<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.709> when<00:02:24.040> they<00:02:24.130> warm<00:02:24.400> up<00:02:24.630> they

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
or do use it and when they warm up they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
or do use it and when they warm up they
they<00:02:26.079> stay<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.560> one<00:02:26.769> place<00:02:26.980> for<00:02:27.250> too<00:02:27.310> long<00:02:27.519> so

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
they stay in one place for too long so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.229 
they stay in one place for too long so
what<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.819> mean<00:02:27.970> by<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:30.030> active<00:02:31.030> like

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
what I mean by that is active like

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.330 
what I mean by that is active like
dynamic<00:02:31.450> stretching<00:02:32.110> versus<00:02:32.799> static<00:02:33.040> so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
dynamic stretching versus static so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.539 
dynamic stretching versus static so
static<00:02:33.579> ism<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> hold<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.390> stretch<00:02:34.660> or<00:02:35.549> some

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
static ism you hold a stretch or some

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.240 
static ism you hold a stretch or some
type<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.849> pressure<00:02:37.030> point<00:02:37.360> release<00:02:37.599> for<00:02:38.250> 45

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
type of pressure point release for 45

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.849 
type of pressure point release for 45
seconds<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:39.879> at<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.299> most<00:02:40.510> right<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
seconds right at the most right so the

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.710 
seconds right at the most right so the
way<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.519> before<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.790> warm<00:02:43.060> up<00:02:43.180> excuse

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
way that I do it before I warm up excuse

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.440 
way that I do it before I warm up excuse
me<00:02:43.810> as<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.200> warm<00:02:44.440> up<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.799> squat<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:46.209> do

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
me as I warm up for the squat is I do

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.720 
me as I warm up for the squat is I do
quick<00:02:47.170> pass<00:02:47.410> throughs<00:02:47.769> right<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.489> release

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
quick pass throughs right to release

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.520 
quick pass throughs right to release
tension<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.480> fully<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.170> stretch

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
tension but not to fully like stretch

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.140 
tension but not to fully like stretch
the<00:02:50.709> muscle<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.190> when<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.730> muscle<00:02:52.000> fully

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the muscle because when the muscle fully

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.580 
the muscle because when the muscle fully
like<00:02:52.299> stretches<00:02:52.690> relax<00:02:53.079> it's<00:02:53.319> going<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.500> be

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
like stretches relax it's going to be

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.420 
like stretches relax it's going to be
less<00:02:54.510> active<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.049> movement<00:02:56.410> okay<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:56.799> for

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
less active for the movement okay so for

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.580 
less active for the movement okay so for
example<00:02:57.930> I'll<00:02:58.930> show<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.139> guys<00:02:59.230> kind<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.500> like

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
example I'll show you guys kind of like

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.259 
example I'll show you guys kind of like
when<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.280> see<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.519> lot<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.700> people<00:03:00.819> doing<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
when I see a lot of people doing and

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.819 
when I see a lot of people doing and
what<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.480> wouldn't<00:03:01.959> necessarily<00:03:02.079> recommend<00:03:02.380> to

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
what I wouldn't necessarily recommend to

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.020 
what I wouldn't necessarily recommend to
do<00:03:02.920> when<00:03:03.040> your<00:03:03.160> foot<00:03:03.400> when<00:03:03.549> your<00:03:03.670> foam<00:03:03.850> rolling

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
do when your foot when your foam rolling

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.650 
do when your foot when your foam rolling
is<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.900> sit<00:03:05.139> in<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.410> spot<00:03:06.030> or<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.180> if<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.329> sit<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.569> a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
is to sit in a spot or so if I sit in a

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.229 
is to sit in a spot or so if I sit in a
spot<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:07.989> put<00:03:08.139> my<00:03:08.230> weight<00:03:08.349> on<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:09.000> right<00:03:10.000> for

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
spot and I put my weight on it right for

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.330 
spot and I put my weight on it right for
this<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.450> 45<00:03:10.840> seconds<00:03:11.290> you're<00:03:11.709> slowly<00:03:12.040> like

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
this to 45 seconds you're slowly like

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.770 
this to 45 seconds you're slowly like
releasing<00:03:12.849> tension<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.329> muscle<00:03:13.630> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
releasing tension in the muscle and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.390 
releasing tension in the muscle and
that's<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.440> could<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> good<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.040> bad<00:03:15.160> thing

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
that's it could be a good in a bad thing

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.430 
that's it could be a good in a bad thing
it's<00:03:15.549> not<00:03:16.060> enough<00:03:16.359> tension<00:03:16.599> could<00:03:17.079> be<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> bad

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
it's not enough tension could be a bad

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.170 
it's not enough tension could be a bad
thing<00:03:17.470> too<00:03:18.040> much<00:03:18.280> tension<00:03:18.579> could<00:03:18.880> be<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> bad

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
thing too much tension could be a bad

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.250 
thing too much tension could be a bad
