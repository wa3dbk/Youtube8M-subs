 bread is the amount you want 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.970
 I will do it today with 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.320
 four loaves since with ten then well 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.000
 that it did not reach me because it was a lot 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.820
 then we are going to do it with four 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.950
 loaves the bark is removed 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.310
 and the bark is left so a little bit 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.350
 the bark is removed 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.170
 it's easier if done with a knife 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.210
 Sure but 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.940
 Well I do not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.240
 I decided to use it because I always use 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.520
 hands is more didactic more father 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.479
 then the bark is removed with the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.030
 bold thing how hard it is said and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.030
 here we have our 4 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.550
 after this what is going to be done with 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.480
 the loaves 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.640
 It is much more 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.490
 is going to take the vessel 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.490
 and must pass to crumble bread 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.220
 of bread for bread one by one is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.220
 crumble 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.780
 and it starts 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 A.M 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.290
 beat like this you can not use the blender 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.530
 or with your hands until it is hard 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.349
 I say until it is as if it were for 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.420
 friend and that's more or less how you owe them 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.160
 to stay is this way by the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.260
 quantity of breads that we use but 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.870
 even so for a small craft 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.959
 it works then we are going to add 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.769
 one and a half tablespoons of glycerin and one 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.769

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.330
 half a tablespoon of vinegar if you do not 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.190

 moldable and non-sticky dough 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:33.170
