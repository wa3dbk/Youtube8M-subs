00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 jacquard two colors did not go to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.670
 take the 4 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.830
 the drawings placed or whatever 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.250
 at the beginning it is good to take a moment 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.250
 the hand on how they say about the two 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.980
 colors is simpler tourism wire tensioner 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.290
 because you must never wear them 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.500
 cross a slightly more yarn 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.010
 Often this second case we are 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 with three garments 228 and one gray 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.979
 slightly more up to indicate the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.760
 situation we set the 38 update 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.760
 the car 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 we delete step control what is the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.870
 gate with there tells me no sign 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.190
 point number 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.510
 I say thank you for putting so much on 38 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:15.250
 ends with the yellow ball will be on 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.710
 track 4 thank and say ok selector 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.620
 always one because we are working with 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.480
 all designs on all floors 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:28.810
 revised we place there are needles or 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.450
 selecting one for 1 for the most 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.120
 fast a future for 6 of samplers 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 tension for the moment I do not know is one 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.210
 sampling might not be good if 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.850
 these are let's say the tension 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.690
 good enough to work with 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.550
 short comb we don't end up supporting 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.960
 nothing happens because clearly 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.229
 even if he doesn't take some needle it 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.229
 will take after we see two pieces 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.340
 here they are served with me 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.110
 put it does nothing to raise streams 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.330
 all the years that I was not the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.060
 meta work we had put in position a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.530
 this steps that 9 with two steps 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.540
 very simple there are considerable delays 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.880
 hassles in the sampling in the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:35.520
 sample face turns also because he can 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.520
 happen as we lose needles here 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.590
 so it's not a problem 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.690
 I bring the car beyond the sensor is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.830
 this is the only step you need 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.730
 always remember about the spots 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.500
 electronics want to knob sensor 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.500
 command k psi 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.850
 help yourself if the thread gets loose 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.460
 we select that at this point it is good 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.550
 check on the cart and cart yes 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.980
 by two he tells us that he is a contractor 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.840
 corresponds to the first mc key ie 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620
 multicolor play what we need 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.030
 do us 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.890
 if the permits but both would be for l 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.360
 is about to injure a laser 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.120
 in short, I do not speak English but I do point lace 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.330
 so basically we are able to 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.500
 being able to manage both keys then a 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.780
 we serve pink meat first we have to 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.450
 position and now I'll show you 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.420
 because those who always do not find it 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.910
 hard you don't have to open enough 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.390
 only and spin to check only 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.810
 that up to school keep it down with one 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.610
 hand and this is the only uncomfortable thing to 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.360
 this cart will take only one 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.209
 so take this at the beginning 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.760
 point the selection machine 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.290
 we point to the left not left 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.910
 still the thread 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.560
 I'm moving to see better 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.380
 who worked on the first lap 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 so it remains for those ahead in the brother 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.970
 and dangling thread 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:31.020
 I believe it is a very short board has 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.470
 played at 8 laps so let 's see 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.470
 repeats 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:05:00.750
 the car clearly selects all 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:05:00.750
 civilians arrive to have final tour 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.220
 this point when you have finished the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.130
 sampling what to remove 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.130
 take it strung forward 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.870
 break if the cart hid like this after 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.410
 of which he supervised the china on 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.920
 command knob of the let's say 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:31.270
 automatic card selection 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:39.310
 as you have seen he succeeded in the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:42.720
 button and play useless colors are 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.720
 two then highlights well 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.070
 I always take the gestures more for granted 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.080
 normal that I do automatically sorry 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:58.330
 for a while, even the second on standstill 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.260
 we can so the cart and without yarn 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:10.140
 so empty it as friends is 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:10.140
 parade and job cuts here it is 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:23.710
 He was in a hurry to do this is 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.290
 what is called reverse with i 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.430
 children who are a bit slow but then in the 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:33.880
 ironing this is not excessive e 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:38.560
 this is the real network design 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:44.710
 as elastic as a venue and this is the 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:48.580
 the same identical design of centuries of 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:53.889
 above if inverted color ie gray 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:57.669
 under instead of white and white of 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.320
 contrast that is in sin b had a 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.449
 completely different design then 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.090
 when you do sampler have fun 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.789
 do this too 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:10.630
 recapitulating this tremendous sacal like 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:14.280
 they often told me to place copper and 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:22.740
 I don't show them because they can escape 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:24.360
 then reposition athens come to head 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.700
 Gremese 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.860
 the first key we made was there 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.310
 clearly positioning the second 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.289
 pilato 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.800
 this was only to remember i 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.800
 steps
