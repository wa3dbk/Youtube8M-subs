00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.070
 Hello, good afternoon guys and girls 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.170
 Welcome to my channel again and good 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.519
 yesterday we taught how to download the 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.360
 sniper elite version 3 and translate everything 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.060
 the whole Castilian game and what 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.429
 promised is debt here we have a crack 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.070
 a patch to create as a patch like 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.929
 you want to call to play online and go to 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.660
 be the first tutorial that there is in 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.110
 youtube to be able to play online and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.720
 that there is nothing nothing at all of nothing and 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 good luck sag orc because I have 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 seen in a blog of hers 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.940
 and that and downloaded and here I bring it to 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.949
 all of you fine how to install it very 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.949
 easy we give to open the rap 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.130
 and this is very easy, let's go to the game 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.820
 team 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.190
 the local disk program files 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.060
 sniper elite and we put the folder here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.420
 ok very easy first what are we going to do 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.420
 take this and pass it to click 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.530
 well let's give it to perform in the seven 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.530
 conflicts move and replace continue 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.930
 and as you see be replaced if you want 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 backup because the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.550
 backups do what you're going to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.740
 replace with anything we go to the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.280
 vile folder 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.970
 we copy this 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.970
 and the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.610
 we also replace continue 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.510
 well once this is done 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.430
 if we give it here it will not work or be 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.530
 It's not like the other version 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.710
 that is the same version but the other 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.690
 crack if he let us open those here and 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.000
 right now it will not let us open the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.770
 from here that we are going to do then for it 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 We are going to sting, I recommend you to do 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.060
 One account 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.770
 because as I catch you they can handle us 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.709
 or fuck the account and if you have things 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.260
 bought or whatever it is because it's going to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.209
 make a fat bitch well after 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.959
 have gotten the craft we close jump and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.959
 we open steam 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.050
 he said it 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.770
 let's go to games 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.650
 and then you have to add the game that 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.450
 you destine us the library you are looking for 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.080
 here I think I have already added it 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.840
 but just added 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.080
 you look for it here 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.080
 and the one that is you give to add well 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.450
 ok let's go to games 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.150
 to see how it was that no 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.050
 of the library of games and as you see 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.020
 here it is 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.010
 and we give it to play and it will open 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.480
 the screen 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.580
 to play 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.370
 I'm going to put the frap right now 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.180
 give to play so that you see inside the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.569
 game as comfortable 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.490
 As you said, do not use your account and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.520
 make one to play 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.800
 a greeting comment a link that if so 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.800
 if it has helped you and even other friends 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.400
 good after having given him in the play 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.600
 in the steam as we enter the game and 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.870
 we give to multiplayer 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.300
 you remember whoever has seen my life 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.980
 previous one was charging loading 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:50.069
 loading and good and as you see here then 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.219
 we have a few servers 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.579
 and you can update to see if you can 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.200
 update is worth updating before 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.989
 when you must update before 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.050
 it was like this and it did not collect data now 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.300
 yes collects data 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.940
 and well let's see enter a game 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.570
 to prove in this same that there is no 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.570
 many people 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.170
 if they expect more players 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.170
 what is this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.970
 Well, it's not what it was like, you see here 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.090

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.470
 and how it is loading here is for the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.110
 departure and good, well I said that 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.070

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.610
 to see how this goes 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.000
 white white heifer as you can see 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.000
 we are in multiplayer 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.470

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.470
 where the bad guys will be here 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.060
 to get me a tsar sniper 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.060

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.080

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.659
 at the end of the game finishing the part 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:59.169
 Well, as you have seen, it works 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:02.310
