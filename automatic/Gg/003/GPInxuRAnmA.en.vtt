00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
foundation face I'm applying the shade

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.290 
foundation face I'm applying the shade
stick<00:00:27.550> as<00:00:27.790> a<00:00:27.849> base<00:00:28.270> for<00:00:28.750> my<00:00:29.079> eyeshadows<00:00:30.300> so

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
stick as a base for my eyeshadows so

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.600 
stick as a base for my eyeshadows so
it's<00:00:31.480> really<00:00:31.720> creamy<00:00:32.169> and<00:00:32.410> it<00:00:32.710> just<00:00:32.950> glides<00:00:33.130> on

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
and it really helps the eyeshadow to

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.720 
and it really helps the eyeshadow to
hold<00:00:36.340> all<00:00:36.640> day<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:37.300> it<00:00:37.870> won't<00:00:38.079> budge<00:00:38.469> and<00:00:38.890> it's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
on the inner two-thirds of my eyelids

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.190 
on the inner two-thirds of my eyelids
just<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:25.960> top<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.650> blue<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.780> as<00:01:28.900> you<00:01:29.050> can

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
just on top of that blue and as you can

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200 
just on top of that blue and as you can
see<00:01:29.230> it's<00:01:29.560> really<00:01:29.800> brightened<00:01:30.550> up<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.790> blue

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
see it's really brightened up the blue

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
see it's really brightened up the blue
and<00:01:31.510> changed<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.380> color<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:33.240> lighting

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and changed the color of it lighting

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.040 
and changed the color of it lighting
then<00:01:36.430> I'm<00:01:36.550> taking<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:37.030> dark<00:01:37.330> gray<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:37.960> I'm

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
then I'm taking the dark gray and I'm

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.280 
then I'm taking the dark gray and I'm
putting<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.410> on<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.560> outer<00:01:38.950> third<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.730> my<00:01:40.060> eye

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
putting it on the outer third of my eye

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.230 
putting it on the outer third of my eye
so<00:01:41.290> from<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:41.740> corner<00:01:42.250> I'm<00:01:42.640> just<00:01:42.850> trying<00:01:43.180> to

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
so from that corner I'm just trying to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.140 
so from that corner I'm just trying to
blend<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.160> not<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.790> harsh<00:01:46.270> line<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
blend it in so it's not a harsh line and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.680 
blend it in so it's not a harsh line and
it<00:01:49.150> really<00:01:49.420> helps<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.870> shape<00:01:50.260> your<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.570> give<00:01:52.570> it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
it really helps to shape your I give it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.890 
it really helps to shape your I give it
a<00:01:52.750> bit<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:52.930> depth<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.770> perception

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
a bit of depth and perception

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.160 
a bit of depth and perception
then<00:01:56.770> I'm<00:01:56.890> taking<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.400> Mac<00:01:57.700> 226<00:01:58.510> brush<00:01:58.840> and

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
then I'm taking this Mac 226 brush and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.260 
then I'm taking this Mac 226 brush and
I'm<00:01:59.650> just<00:01:59.710> going<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.130> use<00:02:00.370> windshield<00:02:01.030> wiper

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
I'm just going to use windshield wiper

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.380 
I'm just going to use windshield wiper
motions<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.020> blend<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.560> into<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.280> crease<00:02:03.640> so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
motions to blend it into the crease so

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.390 
motions to blend it into the crease so
i'm<00:02:04.510> not<00:02:04.690> using<00:02:04.900> very<00:02:05.260> much<00:02:05.500> pressure<00:02:05.860> but

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
i'm not using very much pressure but

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.609 
i'm not using very much pressure but
lightly<00:02:06.700> sweeping<00:02:07.480> back<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.080> forth<00:02:08.290> back<00:02:08.590> and

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
lightly sweeping back and forth back and

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.520 
lightly sweeping back and forth back and
forth<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:10.030> really<00:02:10.330> helps<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.869> blend<00:02:11.200> out

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
forth and it really helps to blend out

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.370

the stark white color I'm just going to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
both my eyes and this helps to brighten

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.949 
both my eyes and this helps to brighten
up<00:03:03.040> your<00:03:03.100> eyes<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:04.269> apply<00:03:04.630> some

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
up your eyes and then apply some

up your eyes and then apply some
underneath<00:03:05.500> your<00:03:05.709> brow<00:03:05.980> blending<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.090> all<00:03:07.239> the

way down to your crease from both eyes

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.890 
way down to your crease from both eyes
now<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.680> looks<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.160> little<00:03:12.370> harsh<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.540> white

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
now this looks a little harsh and white

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.350 
now this looks a little harsh and white
but<00:03:14.680> we're<00:03:15.160> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.489> fix<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.820> in<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> minute

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
but we're going to fix that in a minute

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.949

and<00:03:16.660> i'll<00:03:16.810> show<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.050> how<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.470> do<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> I'm

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
and i'll show you how to do that so I'm

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.840 
and i'll show you how to do that so I'm
taking<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.410> little<00:03:20.650> piece<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:21.040> cotton<00:03:21.220> wool<00:03:21.580> and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.009 
i'm just going to swipe off any excess
white<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.330> doesn't<00:03:25.840> look<00:03:25.989> as<00:03:26.290> stark<00:03:28.019> using

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
white so it doesn't look as stark using

then just repeating that on the other
side<00:03:50.920> using<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.910> volumizing<00:03:52.450> mascara<00:03:52.720> first

I'm just going to apply that to my
lashes<00:03:57.420> looking<00:03:58.420> down<00:03:58.660> into

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
lashes looking down into

lashes looking down into
small<00:03:59.739> mirror<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.400> find<00:04:00.819> it<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.030> lot<00:04:01.180> easier<00:04:01.360> that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
small mirror I find it a lot easier that

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.890 
small mirror I find it a lot easier that
way<00:04:01.870> because<00:04:02.380> we<00:04:02.860> won't<00:04:03.040> get<00:04:03.400> any<00:04:03.700> mascara<00:04:04.569> on

your eyelids where you've just worked on
