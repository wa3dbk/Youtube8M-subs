00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello how are you welcome to this your 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.879
 channel your android staff and in this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.420
 occasion we will analyze in depth 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.980
 what is telegram an alternative to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.980
 messaging we begin 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.199
 very well in this section we can see 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.779
 that there are several applications that meet 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.849
 with the messaging or applications that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.469
 meet the requirement to contact 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 with our loved ones or friends 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:37.199
 among them is the whatsapp the hangout 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.820
 they are line among others but if we go 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.460
 to buy a little more what is the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.300
 whatsapp with the telegram and then we're going to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 give what are some points of view or 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.750
 some improvements that telegram has 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 regarding whatsapp since I think it's 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.179
 better than whatsapp only that then for the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 moment whatsapp is more popular and has 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.690
 more community behind her first that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.300
 nothing is free for a few moments 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.840
 or for a while whatsapp was charging 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.390
 and currently after a while 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.340
 started charging 13 pesos per year 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.320
 then telegram is currently 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 free does not have any kind of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.420
 advertising and I think it 's a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.369
 small advantage for those people 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.380
 that they can not pay for applications 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.329
 this application because it uses less data 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 then as regards use 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.689
 with the 3g will spend us 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 much less amount of bytes at the moment 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 of doing the shipments has more networks 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.100
 around the world so according to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.950
 he says it's much faster than 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.750
 other other messaging systems are 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 keep in the cloud then if we 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.929
 we change device or even if 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.119
 we change to another operating system 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.280
 messaging and messages as well as 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.770
 contacts are going to be maintained in our 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
 cellular is a weapon way in a way 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 precise to be able to keep in touch 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 with those people another very point 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.700
 important is that it is a multiplatform 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.310
 in a real way because then you can 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 use on android in ios and there's also 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.539
 versions for computers like mac and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.730
 in windows I currently use a 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.190
 then in regards to the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.200
 cross-platform is a real cross- platform 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.900
 not like other applications that you have 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.099
 that install other programs to be able 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 use them is open source 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.510
 then for the people who are 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.459
 developers will like it a little 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.610
 what is this point with respect to other 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.730
 applications according to what is said and according to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.909
 it seems it is much safer than the watch 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.090
 has an encryption of greater security and 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.830
 also out there they said they were 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.709
 they offered $ 200,000 to the person 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.720
 able to hack this application which 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.450
 Well, I think it says a lot that if it's 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.739
 very secure the encryption is different and 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.330
 all conversations are going to 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.970
 keep safe are going to be deleted by 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.519
 completely they will not be shared and also 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.950
 have options of what is messages 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.420
 encrypted and self- erased that when 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.030
 I sent them to be deleted and they are not going to 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.099
 save anywhere else in if it's 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.790
 fast is fluid here in the settings 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.750
 we can activate the animations the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.579
 notifications and the sounds that 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.879
 we want you to have when we receive a 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.040
 notification an alert regarding that 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.440
 we can also what is to include in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.200
 groups more than 200 people we can 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.420
 send attachments of any 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.879
 type there is no restriction on telegram 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.950
 also allows what is a gigabyte to 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.500
 send any document any 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.540
 file for shipping here in the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.370
 alerts is if we want you to alert us 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.980
 the preview of the vibration message 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.760
 the sound we want it to sound when 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.220
 they come to us 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.569
 message the group notifications in 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.220
 the application the sounds of the 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.310
 application at the moment that a person 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.010
 You can see our message or not 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.500
 answer we can also reset 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.970
 all the previous configurations and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.459
 blocked users we can block 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.120
 users to avoid talks 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.099
 annoying 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.349
 the background of the chat, you can also 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.750
 change and it's coming with images 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.299
 predetermined that if you want you can 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.569
 change in a way as simple as 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.310
 is to select one and be able to change it 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.400
 automatically finish other sessions 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.859
 we can close the messages on 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.500
 size of the text sending with a mind 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.370
 then there are several options that have 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.190
 here then this phone we can create a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.530
 new group we can choose people 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.630
 which is in our contacts we can 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.060
 add as many people 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.490
 possible to see our contacts and all the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.710
 people who are on telegram as I say 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.199
 Well, one small disadvantage is that it is 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.400
 evolving but it is an application that 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.190
 is growing enormously then I 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.009
 I would not hesitate to use it or give it a 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.400
 opportunity to use this 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.800
 application we can look for some person 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.600
 here for example is very fast there 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.030
 files that are sent in a way 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.560
 very easy very easy and for 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.360
 example here I'm working on a 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.440
 project called start nitti group 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.979
 which is like a group of friends that 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.889
 we have the same goal that is to do 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.930
 what we like that in general is the 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.490
 technology fix phones to 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.650
 maintenance computers 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.990
 update then is a project that 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.110
 we are carrying out we are five 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.090
 six people and good because that's a 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.520
 group that I am in is very fast 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.370
 very versatile is multiplatform I think that 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.250
 it is something very good has the 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.930
 same characteristic and the same fund or 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.199
 the same scheme that had whatsapp 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.259
 same and icons or same account with 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.240
 the icons and a very similar interface or 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.650
 equal to whatsapp 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.449
 I think this is good since those who 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.720
 they were used to this application 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.930
 they do not go 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.420
 what to do more than open the application and 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.740
 to be able to automatically enjoy it 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.380
 I think it's a great alternative 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.210
 Regarding whatsapp I think they should give 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.740
 an opportunity is free I'm going to 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.450
 leave the link below in the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.710
 description so that you go to 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.080
 download telegram 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.240
 and this application will continue to grow 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.820
 it's a simple recommendation little by little 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.310
 is going to adapt to what are the 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.080
 tastes of the people themselves but good 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.700
 this has been all I hope you have 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.980

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.920
