can see I've done that already so once
you've<00:00:36.690> done<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> start<00:00:37.739> up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you've done that you need to start up

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.400 
you've done that you need to start up
your<00:00:37.980> server<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.210> start<00:00:39.510> myself<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
your server so if I start myself up this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
your server so if I start myself up this
will<00:00:40.649> generate<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.100> config<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.210> server

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
will generate a config for that server

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.490 
will generate a config for that server
so<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.140> running<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so that's going to be running in the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
so that's going to be running in the
background<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.730> I'll<00:00:44.910> ignore<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.300> for

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
background and then I'll ignore that for

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
background and then I'll ignore that for
now<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> our<00:00:47.610> plugin<00:00:48.000> folder<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
now so if we go to our plugin folder you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
now so if we go to our plugin folder you
can<00:00:48.570> watch<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.989> config<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.680> generated<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.489> there

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
can watch a config be generated so there

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
can watch a config be generated so there
you<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.850> you've<00:00:51.000> got<00:00:51.120> config<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.500> gives

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you go you've got config and it gives

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
you go you've got config and it gives
you<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.910> when<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> run<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.750> scoreboard

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you that now when you run a scoreboard

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
you that now when you run a scoreboard
for<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> first<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> will<00:00:56.370> generate<00:00:56.610> more

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
for the first time it will generate more

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.910 
for the first time it will generate more
config<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:57.870> we'll<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.199> into<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> sec<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
config which we'll look into a sec you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
config which we'll look into a sec you
don't<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.219> need<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.989> good

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
don't even need to see it but it's good

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
don't even need to see it but it's good
to<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> adds<00:01:02.010> at<00:01:02.430> how<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> stores<00:01:03.359> all

the<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> works<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> higher<00:01:26.100> number<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the way it works is the higher number is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.030 
the way it works is the higher number is
always<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.000> top<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> our

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
always on top so if we go on to our

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
always on top so if we go on to our
config<00:01:29.520> scoreboard<00:01:30.450> stats<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.079> any<00:01:31.350> edit<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
then what that'll do is will generate

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.609 
then what that'll do is will generate
another<00:01:54.210> config<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:55.079> look<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.560> for

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
another config which will look out for

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
another config which will look out for
kills<00:01:56.070> deaths<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.610> kill<00:01:56.759> streaks<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.750> we

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
kills deaths and kill streaks so if we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
kills deaths and kill streaks so if we
save<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.439> then<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> reload<00:01:59.009> I'll<00:01:59.549> show

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
save that and then do a reload I'll show

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.050 
save that and then do a reload I'll show
you<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.030> means

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
you what that means

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.950 
you what that means

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
isn't working on this version that's why

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.709 
isn't working on this version that's why
I'm<00:02:05.280> doing<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.579> force<00:02:05.820> reload<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.600> can

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
see I got a two new files generated you

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.760 
see I got a two new files generated you
don't<00:02:09.750> even<00:02:09.869> need<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> look<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
don't even need to look at these this is

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.370 
don't even need to look at these this is
just<00:02:10.800> how<00:02:11.099> they<00:02:11.250> store<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> information

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
just how they store the information

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.560 
just how they store the information
but<00:02:13.370> say<00:02:13.550> if<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.760> wanted<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.210> scoreboard

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
but say if you wanted to do a scoreboard

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.450 
but say if you wanted to do a scoreboard
reset<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.320> delete<00:02:15.560> them<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.860> files<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
reset you can delete them to files and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.610 
reset you can delete them to files and
then<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> will<00:02:17.150> delete<00:02:17.330> all<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.570> records<00:02:18.020> so

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
then it will delete all the records so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.740 
then it will delete all the records so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
we're going to focus on and the coughing

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.670 
we're going to focus on and the coughing
let's<00:03:05.060> plug<00:03:05.240> in<00:03:05.360> they<00:03:05.450> also<00:03:05.660> let<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.990> use<00:03:06.170> MCM

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
let's plug in they also let you use MCM

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.990 
let's plug in they also let you use MCM
oh<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:06.920> simple<00:03:07.250> client<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.760> bunch<00:03:07.910> of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
oh and simple client and a bunch of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.910 
oh and simple client and a bunch of
other<00:03:08.180> plugins<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.110> have<00:03:09.260> factions<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:09.800> our

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
other plugins so we have factions on our

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.470 
other plugins so we have factions on our
server<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.490> we<00:03:10.520> might<00:03:10.820> want<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.060> tell<00:03:11.300> them<00:03:11.450> how

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
server so we might want to tell them how

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.960 
server so we might want to tell them how
much<00:03:11.600> power<00:03:11.930> they<00:03:12.110> have<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.500> how<00:03:13.220> many<00:03:13.280> people

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
much power they have and how many people

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.590 
much power they have and how many people
are<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.420> lot<00:03:14.750> online<00:03:14.990> on<00:03:15.380> their<00:03:15.500> faction<00:03:16.600> so

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
are a lot online on their faction so

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.150 
are a lot online on their faction so
that's<00:03:17.750> like<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.900> cool<00:03:18.170> thing<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.440> can<00:03:18.590> do

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
that's like a cool thing you can do

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.800 
that's like a cool thing you can do
MCM<00:03:19.880> oh<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.120> going<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:20.300> be<00:03:20.360> obvious<00:03:20.630> what<00:03:20.720> you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
MCM oh it's going to be obvious what you

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.390 
MCM oh it's going to be obvious what you
can<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:20.990> with<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.260> sumo<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.800> display

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
can do with it and sumo you can display

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.250 
can do with it and sumo you can display
all<00:03:22.460> your<00:03:22.640> levels<00:03:23.030> your<00:03:23.270> max<00:03:23.480> level<00:03:23.690> it's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
all your levels your max level it's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.980 
all your levels your max level it's
pretty<00:03:24.470> cool<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.700> economy<00:03:26.240> okay<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.690> we're

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
pretty cool and economy okay so we're

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.200 
pretty cool and economy okay so we're
going<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.140> go<00:03:27.290> into<00:03:27.500> PvP<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.280> time<00:03:28.460> so<00:03:29.090> we

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
going to go into PvP this time so we

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.180 
going to go into PvP this time so we
want<00:03:29.450> them<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:30.200> see<00:03:30.530> how<00:03:30.680> many<00:03:30.740> kills<00:03:31.040> they

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
want them to see how many kills they

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.920 
want them to see how many kills they
have<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.970> all<00:03:32.210> we<00:03:32.300> have<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.450> do<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.780> just

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
have so all we have to do is just

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.380 
have so all we have to do is just
duplicate<00:03:33.440> one<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.650> these<00:03:33.850> replace<00:03:34.850> the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
duplicate one of these replace the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.450 
duplicate one of these replace the
inside<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.110> this<00:03:36.260> make<00:03:36.680> sure<00:03:36.710> you<00:03:37.040> keep<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
inside of this make sure you keep the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.610 
inside of this make sure you keep the
two<00:03:37.640> commas<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.240> outside<00:03:38.570> then<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.350> can

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
two commas on the outside then you can

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.520 
two commas on the outside then you can
rename<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.460> so<00:03:40.820> call<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.180> kills<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.660> then

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
rename it so call it kills and then

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.040 
rename it so call it kills and then
we're<00:03:42.680> going<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.860> have<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.130> def<00:03:43.370> displayed

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
we're going to have that def displayed

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.210 
we're going to have that def displayed
and<00:03:45.050> that's<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.470> same<00:03:45.650> again<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.100> just

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
and that's the same again you just

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.460 
and that's the same again you just
repeat<00:03:46.610> this<00:03:46.730> process<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.690> have<00:03:47.840> kills<00:03:48.110> we

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
repeat this process so we have kills we

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.060 
repeat this process so we have kills we
have<00:03:48.730> deaths<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.240> we'll<00:03:50.360> call<00:03:50.510> this<00:03:50.660> stuff

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
have deaths and we'll call this stuff

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.840 
have deaths and we'll call this stuff
and<00:03:52.600> then<00:03:53.600> we<00:03:53.900> were<00:03:53.990> going<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.440> kdr<00:03:55.100> so<00:03:55.790> if

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
and then we were going to have kdr so if

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
and then we were going to have kdr so if
we<00:03:55.970> close<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.630> make<00:03:56.870> another<00:03:57.080> one<00:03:57.260> we

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
we close that and make another one we

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.750 
we close that and make another one we
can<00:03:58.160> actually<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.550> type<00:03:58.760> KD<00:03:59.090> r<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:01.490> you

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
can actually just type KD r that you

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.190 
can actually just type KD r that you
might<00:04:02.150> be<00:04:02.240> easier<00:04:02.480> for<00:04:02.510> just<00:04:02.720> cooking<00:04:03.020> basics

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
might be easier for just cooking basics

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.310 
might be easier for just cooking basics
about<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.800> symbol<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:04.700> we<00:04:04.790> can<00:04:04.910> do<00:04:05.000> carrier

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
about that symbol so we can do carrier

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.830 
about that symbol so we can do carrier
by<00:04:06.320> default<00:04:06.800> kills<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.459> our<00:04:07.640> player<00:04:08.120> kills<00:04:08.450> if

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
by default kills it our player kills if

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.540 
by default kills it our player kills if
you<00:04:09.080> want<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.350> if<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.010> want<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.280> display

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
you want to if you want it to display

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.370 
you want to if you want it to display
how<00:04:10.730> many<00:04:10.850> mobs<00:04:11.090> are<00:04:11.300> killed<00:04:11.540> there's<00:04:12.020> a<00:04:12.140> mob

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
how many mobs are killed there's a mob

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.350 
how many mobs are killed there's a mob
there<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:12.860> can<00:04:12.980> also<00:04:13.130> do<00:04:13.550> kill<00:04:13.820> streak<00:04:14.150> and

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
there you can also do kill streak and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.180 
there you can also do kill streak and
current<00:04:14.720> kill<00:04:14.870> streak<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:15.800> that's<00:04:15.950> pretty

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
current kill streak so that's pretty

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.729 
current kill streak so that's pretty
cool<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:17.109> then<00:04:18.109> we're<00:04:18.260> going<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.440> call<00:04:18.620> this

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
cool and then we're going to call this

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.459 
cool and then we're going to call this
KD<00:04:19.160> our

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:20.469 
KD our

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.170 
KD our
the<00:04:21.469> kdr<00:04:21.859> system<00:04:22.189> is<00:04:22.280> pretty<00:04:22.430> goodness<00:04:23.030> you

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
the kdr system is pretty goodness you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.999 
the kdr system is pretty goodness you
need<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.539> have<00:04:23.719> I<00:04:23.990> think<00:04:24.229> more<00:04:24.439> than<00:04:24.469> a<00:04:24.740> couple

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
need to have I think more than a couple

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.429 
need to have I think more than a couple
of<00:04:25.129> kills<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.639> one<00:04:26.150> death<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.479> think<00:04:26.509> actually

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
of kills and one death I think actually

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.230 
of kills and one death I think actually
either<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.919> need<00:04:28.039> any<00:04:28.189> deaths<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:28.669> you

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
either if you need any deaths but you

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.429 
either if you need any deaths but you
need<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.389> couple<00:04:29.659> kills<00:04:29.960> for<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.289> register

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:30.439 
need a couple kills for it to register

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.730 
need a couple kills for it to register
so<00:04:31.129> now<00:04:31.279> this<00:04:31.669> should<00:04:31.729> hopefully<00:04:32.529> despite<00:04:33.529> all

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
so now this should hopefully despite all

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.290 
so now this should hopefully despite all
the<00:04:33.860> stuff<00:04:34.069> we<00:04:34.189> want<00:04:34.400> on<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.580> right<00:04:34.939> hand<00:04:35.090> side

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
the stuff we want on the right hand side

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.429 
the stuff we want on the right hand side
and<00:04:35.749> if<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:35.960> doesn't<00:04:36.110> we're<00:04:36.259> going<00:04:36.379> to

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:36.439 
and if it doesn't we're going to

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.170 
and if it doesn't we're going to
troubleshoot<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:36.949> okay<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.699> doesn't<00:04:37.789> it

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
troubleshoot it okay so it doesn't it

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279 
me we have zero dev so let's just make

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.619 
me we have zero dev so let's just make
sure<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.520> works<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:48.219> we<00:04:49.219> have<00:04:49.610> this<00:04:50.419> should

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
sure it works and we have this should

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.839 
sure it works and we have this should
turn<00:04:50.779> to<00:04:50.960> one<00:04:51.110> death<00:04:51.349> there<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.400> go<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.699> day

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
turn to one death there you go one day

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.149 
turn to one death there you go one day
now<00:04:53.419> if<00:04:53.599> you<00:04:53.719> think<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.409> think<00:04:54.590> that

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
now if you think that you think that

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.800 
now if you think that you think that
it's<00:04:55.279> a<00:04:55.340> bit<00:04:55.490> too<00:04:55.520> laggy<00:04:55.819> or<00:04:56.000> we<00:04:56.210> updated<00:04:56.569> it<00:04:56.750> to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
it's a bit too laggy or we updated it to

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.140 
it's a bit too laggy or we updated it to
you<00:04:56.930> quickly<00:04:57.169> you<00:04:57.860> can<00:04:58.009> also<00:04:58.159> change<00:04:58.580> how<00:04:58.789> fast

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
you quickly you can also change how fast

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.209 
you quickly you can also change how fast
it<00:04:59.449> updates<00:04:59.840> or<00:05:00.080> how<00:05:00.289> quickly<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.889> checks<00:05:01.129> the

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
it updates or how quickly it checks the

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.580 
it updates or how quickly it checks the
server<00:05:01.520> after<00:05:01.789> an<00:05:02.629> event<00:05:02.900> happens<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:03.439> that

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
server after an event happens so that

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.129 
server after an event happens so that
could<00:05:04.099> reduce<00:05:04.460> lag<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:05.389> if<00:05:05.479> we<00:05:05.599> go<00:05:05.779> onto<00:05:05.990> our

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
could reduce lag so if we go onto our

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.089 
could reduce lag so if we go onto our
plugin<00:05:06.590> folder<00:05:07.099> and<00:05:08.529> then<00:05:09.529> there<00:05:09.710> should<00:05:09.949> be<00:05:10.069> a

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
plugin folder and then there should be a

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.839 
plugin folder and then there should be a
way<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.340> disable<00:05:11.620> house<00:05:12.620> where<00:05:13.339> is<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.580> okay

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
way to disable house where is it okay

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.029 
way to disable house where is it okay
update<00:05:14.210> away<00:05:14.449> so<00:05:14.689> for<00:05:15.050> every<00:05:15.259> two<00:05:15.289> ticks<00:05:15.740> it's

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
update away so for every two ticks it's

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.670 
update away so for every two ticks it's
going<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.339> check<00:05:16.580> for<00:05:16.909> a<00:05:17.509> def<00:05:18.020> we're<00:05:18.439> going<00:05:18.620> to

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
going to check for a def we're going to

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.050 
going to check for a def we're going to
make<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.009> seven<00:05:19.339> ticks<00:05:19.550> because<00:05:19.789> we're<00:05:19.909> not

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
make it seven ticks because we're not

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.879 
make it seven ticks because we're not
too<00:05:20.180> fast<00:05:20.419> about<00:05:20.689> it<00:05:20.839> and<00:05:20.990> that's<00:05:21.499> just<00:05:21.770> like

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
too fast about it and that's just like

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.249 
too fast about it and that's just like
an<00:05:22.069> unnecessary<00:05:22.370> strain<00:05:23.029> I've<00:05:23.270> taken<00:05:23.539> off<00:05:23.719> so

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
an unnecessary strain I've taken off so

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.249 
an unnecessary strain I've taken off so
if<00:05:24.319> we<00:05:24.409> go<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.800> never<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:26.060> should<00:05:26.330> MVT

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
if we go to the never this should MVT

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.740 
if we go to the never this should MVT
