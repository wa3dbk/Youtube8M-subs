00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.850
 Hello everyone in this online class 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.640
 free we will learn about the 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.250
 sewing machines overlook or recloser 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.890
 In the market there are different types of 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.680
 sewing machines are the machines of 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.510
 automatic sewing that are perfect for 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.119
 beginners and for those who are 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.160
 they take sewing as a hobby is the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.290
 most common machine in the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.860
 homes today and it's the typical 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.110
 compact device made of plastic material 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.410
 that on the outside carries an arm 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.630
 extendable for easy transport 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.700
 with this type of machines can be 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.699
 make different types of seams 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.129
 stitches and also in the market there 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.820
 a wide variety of models brands and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.250
 see very affordable prices 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.010
 in the second category we would have the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.350
 industrial machines its cost is much 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.390
 major and the main function of this 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.329
 type of machines is sewing 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.250
 professional in clothing workshops or 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.890
 for those people who are dedicated 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.229
 in a professional way to sewing are 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.050
 very heavy and can not be transported 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.390
 easily because they carry a foot of 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.770
 machine or a table where you're going 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.770
 Embedded machine 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.460
 in a third general category are 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.680
 the specialized sewing machines that 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.259
 In addition to the normal sewing machine 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.960
 There are different types of machines 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.000
 sew that perform specific functions 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.030
 for example there is a machine that only 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.549
 make buttonhole in this group would enter 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 the or see it or remedial as it has 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.360
 called all life 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.310
 As I mentioned earlier, 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.620
 Main function of this machine is 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 finish or finish the seams in the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.480
 edge of the fabric and while 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.320
 sewing goes cutting the excess of 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.900
 cloth 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.460
 this is to refine the seams and to 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.630
 that the seams do not look very 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.090
 bulges on the outside of the garment 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.000
 if you are asking it, yes it is 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.549
 can join two fabrics with this kind of 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.979
 machine although I have to say no 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.370
 they replace the machines of 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.709
 sew conventional since they do not sew and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.019
 Zipper neither make eyelets nor pockets 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.450
 outside but they are some machines 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.000
 perfect to finish the seams 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.120
 open for the hems or for 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.430
 sewing stretch fabric or knit as 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.180
 makes a drastic point that is 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.959
 perfect for lycra stitching bikinis 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.959
 or knit sweaters 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.830
 the perfect threads that are used to 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.110
 these machines are a few spools of thread 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.510
 of silk which are the ones that are used 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.570
 all life and there are in various colors 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.330
 although modern machines use and 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.940
 the normals 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.250
 there are two types of machines overlock 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.250
 there are the industrial ones that are more 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.070
 costly and heavier are composed of a 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.170
 foot pedal or machine in addition to a 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.590
 table in which is embedded in the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.830
 machine and an oscar reel holder where 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.500
 go the threads are more directed to the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.140
 professional sewing overlooks 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.170
 automatic are lighter and less 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.840
 expensive are not so professional but 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.110
 they serve perfectly for tasks 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.940
 Daily household is the typical machine 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.120
 of sewing that you find in some 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.400
 Hello leader offers Overlook 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.400
 singer any of these would be worth 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.290
 to start we're going to turn on the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.480
 machine is placed the fabric under the foot of 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.880
 press cloth taking into account that in the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.310
 right of it have some blades 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.640
 that are going to be cutting as they go to 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.400
 go sewing the machines on what can 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.970
 finish only if we place three 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.980
 threads instead if we place four 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.980
 will perform a press punte while 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.650
 They are lowering the edge of the fabric 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.720
 function of the parallel seam ie 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.220
 of the seam of the iphes point that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.080
 performs and riveting at the same time is 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.680
 perfect for making bikinis 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.890
 knitted sweater and dedicated garments exist 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.560
 machines that like this one just re mesh and 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.660
 does not have the function of stitching this 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.100
 you will have to check it before 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.530
 buy it 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.320
 the threading and balancing of this type 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.300
 of machines is very complicated to have 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.770
 and many threads as a mechanism 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.250
 convoluted is very difficult that a 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.830
 machine celebrate equal to another as each 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.100
 model has its different form of 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.920
 thread what I recommend is to catch 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.100
 in the manual and follow step by step the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.100
 indications 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.009
 also to deny this type of machines 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.310
 It is usually done with this type of clamps 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.910
 that are perfect for handling threads 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.980
 inside the mechanism 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.770
 to balance the machine or the 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.760
 tensions we will have to go little by little 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.520
 regulating these wheels that are the 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.610
 censoras of the threads we have in the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.700
 loaders or in the spool holders of 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.610
 our machine feet here our class 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.400
 Today from now the classes 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.060
 We will share every Wednesday os
