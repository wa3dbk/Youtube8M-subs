00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.920
 effective to kill 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.259

 of play 2 lyon does not kill krauser but go 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.969
 You can kill sandler 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.170

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.500
 Energy 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.899
 'resident evil' was inspired by sweet home 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.620
 in the beta of the first game the walls 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.870
 they have resident evil 4 messages and it's going to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.360
 be exclusive for the cube but for the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.480
 commercial success they decided to do 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.410
 multi 'resident evil' was initially 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 thought to be a first person shooter 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.290
 with a downloadable level of resident 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.030
 classic games on the urban chaos map 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.489
 of the Resident Evil Mercenaries 6 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.610
 there are arcade machines and you can 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.570

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.900

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.150
