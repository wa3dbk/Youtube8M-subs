00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 who want to download them I leave them the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.390
 gravity box apk is also in the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.520
 official page of what the team is 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 be and good when they are in a module 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.429
 they will appear like that they are simply going to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.740
 come here they are going to put here the part 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.390
 modules and they will mark it as they see and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.399
 says the list of modules update 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.470
 Anita changes and needs to restart 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.450
 every time they activate a restart module in 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.100
 the phone and it's going to be activated 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.710
 as you see here I already have what is the hall 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.250
 or thames and the gravity box 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.799
 here in this section we can adjust what 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.930
 what is the transparency as you see here 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.289
 we can be transparent in all in 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.110
 all the applications and so on etcetera 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.900
 we can adjust what the buttons are 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.340
 let's see for example the battery 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.830
 Battery indicator here you can choose 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.319
 let's say I'm going to select the here and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.650
 the kit kat as they see and change 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.689
 let's go to the default 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.010
 circular with percentage as you see there 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:32.290
 leave the one you like the most 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.049
 we go back here we can configure 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.400
 what is the clock I put this for 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.620
 center the clock but as you can see 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.720
 there it appears to me I like that it goes here 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.189
 focused and good guys this is very 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.030
 set to your liking 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.549
 just like what is the timer game and 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.959
