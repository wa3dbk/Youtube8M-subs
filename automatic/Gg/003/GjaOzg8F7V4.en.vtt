00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
the phone and I'm going to basically run

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.550 
the phone and I'm going to basically run

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
the tool which we call yellow snow you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.740 
the tool which we call yellow snow you
won't<00:03:00.740> have<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.340> by<00:03:01.520> hand<00:03:01.790> maybe

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
won't have to do this by hand maybe

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
you with the city install so I'm going

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.300 
you with the city install so I'm going
to<00:03:08.270> run<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.720> watch<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.770> phone<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.130> should

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
to run it and watch the phone you should

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.820 
to run it and watch the phone you should
see<00:03:10.580> after<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.810> done<00:03:12.020> step<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.500> should<00:03:12.530> see

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
see after the done step you should see

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.560 
see after the done step you should see
the<00:03:12.920> bars<00:03:13.100> come<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.150> should<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
the bars come on and you should see the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.090 
the bars come on and you should see the
t-mobile<00:03:14.960> network<00:03:15.640> name<00:03:16.640> come<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.980> it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
t-mobile network name come on so it's

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.540 
t-mobile network name come on so it's
probing<00:03:20.950> seeing<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.160> vulnerable

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
probing seeing that is vulnerable

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.130 
probing seeing that is vulnerable
actually<00:03:22.970> doing<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.780> exploit<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:25.930> then<00:03:26.930> it's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
actually doing the exploit and then it's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.980 
actually doing the exploit and then it's
done<00:03:28.060> now<00:03:29.060> we<00:03:29.360> could<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.600> sit<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:29.870> and

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
done now we could just sit here and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.510 
done now we could just sit here and
watch<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.410> should<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.040> network<00:03:31.310> bars

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
watch we should see the network bars

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.880 
watch we should see the network bars
come<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.600> we<00:03:32.660> should<00:03:32.750> see<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.530> tmobile

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
come on and we should see to the tmobile

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.950 
come on and we should see to the tmobile
name<00:03:34.190> come<00:03:34.820> off<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:36.920> are<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.070> bars<00:03:37.960> there's

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
name come off here are the bars there's

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.270 
name come off here are the bars there's
edge<00:03:39.790> through<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.910> t-mobile<00:03:41.240> name<00:03:42.040> I'm<00:03:43.040> going

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
edge through the t-mobile name I'm going

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.180
