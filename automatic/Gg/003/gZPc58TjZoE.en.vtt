00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
camps and then we've got another one

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.880 
camps and then we've got another one
inside<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.969> our<00:00:48.539> clan<00:00:48.989> castle<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.559> we've<00:00:49.680> got

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
inside of our clan castle so we've got

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.689 
inside of our clan castle so we've got
12<00:00:50.399> dragons<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:52.590> raid<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> we

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
12 dragons to raid with all right and we

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.250 
12 dragons to raid with all right and we
got<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:53.910> lightning<00:00:54.360> spell<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> then<00:00:55.170> we've

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
got one lightning spell and then we've

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.430 
got one lightning spell and then we've
got<00:00:55.289> three<00:00:56.180> rage<00:00:57.180> spells<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.870> let's<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.260> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
got three rage spells so let's see we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.630 
got three rage spells so let's see we
can<00:00:58.559> find<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.949> base<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.609> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
can find a base if we can just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
can find a base if we can just
annihilate<00:01:00.449> Miami<00:01:01.410> crystal<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.160> now

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
annihilate Miami crystal one right now

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
annihilate Miami crystal one right now
so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> wouldn't<00:01:03.059> mind<00:01:03.180> staying<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so I wouldn't mind staying up in this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
so I wouldn't mind staying up in this
area<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.979> hopefully<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.240> completely

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
area so hopefully I can just completely

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350 
area so hopefully I can just completely
annihilate<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> base<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.220> um<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
annihilate a base but um why don't you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.289 
annihilate a base but um why don't you
guys<00:01:09.510> hold<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.020> tight<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.820> yeah<00:01:11.820> I'll<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.150> back

then we just want them to head straight
in<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.340> he<00:01:47.399> does<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:48.180> clan<00:01:48.420> castle

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
in now he does have some clan castle

in now he does have some clan castle
troops<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.320> why<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
troops which is why I have that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.219 
troops which is why I have that
lightning<00:01:50.189> spell<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:51.689> reason<00:01:51.720> they

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lightning spell and for some reason they

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
lightning spell and for some reason they
decided<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.710> walk<00:01:52.740> straight<00:01:53.460> through<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
decided to walk straight through it and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.350 
decided to walk straight through it and
away<00:01:54.860> from<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.430> there's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.820> multi-target

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
away from that so there's a multi-target

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
away from that so there's a multi-target
coming<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.860> ahead<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.310> drop

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
coming on I'm going to go ahead and drop

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.399 
coming on I'm going to go ahead and drop
off<00:01:59.850> these<00:02:00.030> other<00:02:00.240> dragons<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.290> at

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
off these other dragons right up here at

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.480 
off these other dragons right up here at
the<00:02:01.469> top<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.200> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.649> looks<00:02:05.369> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the top and I really want to looks like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.130 
the top and I really want to looks like
all<00:02:05.640> those<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> bottom<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.840> gone

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
all those down at the bottom are gone

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.469 
all those down at the bottom are gone
we're<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> rage<00:02:08.220> these<00:02:08.580> guys<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
we're going to rage these guys in here

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.979 
we're going to rage these guys in here
so<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.899> take<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.649> air<00:02:11.009> defense

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
so they can take out that air defense

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.290 
so they can take out that air defense
hopefully

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
hopefully

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.790 
hopefully
we'll<00:02:13.540> turn<00:02:13.720> right<00:02:13.960> there<00:02:14.110> take<00:02:14.380> on<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.650> air

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
defense and then go right there for that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.010 
defense and then go right there for that
