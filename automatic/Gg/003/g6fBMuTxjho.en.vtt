today<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:06.060> talking<00:00:06.240> about<00:00:06.480> NFC

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.869 

with<00:00:13.330> Windows<00:00:13.600> Phone<00:00:13.660> 8<00:00:14.020> Microsoft<00:00:14.760> put<00:00:15.760> out

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
with Windows Phone 8 Microsoft put out

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.560 
with Windows Phone 8 Microsoft put out
support<00:00:16.420> for<00:00:16.779> NFC<00:00:17.170> and<00:00:17.680> a<00:00:18.430> couple<00:00:18.640> OMS<00:00:19.360> have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
support for NFC and a couple OMS have

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.140 
support for NFC and a couple OMS have
taken<00:00:19.900> advantage<00:00:20.020> of<00:00:20.410> that<00:00:20.470> like<00:00:20.920> HTC<00:00:21.759> with

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
taken advantage of that like HTC with

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.679 
taken advantage of that like HTC with
the<00:00:22.450> 8x<00:00:23.170> here<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.640> what<00:00:24.790> can<00:00:24.880> we<00:00:25.000> do<00:00:25.180> with<00:00:25.300> NFC

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
the 8x here so what can we do with NFC

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.470 
the 8x here so what can we do with NFC
well<00:00:26.650> there's<00:00:26.800> a<00:00:26.890> couple<00:00:26.980> apps<00:00:27.340> that<00:00:27.970> will

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
well there's a couple apps that will

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.230 
well there's a couple apps that will
help<00:00:28.779> you<00:00:29.109> get<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.160> most<00:00:30.400> out<00:00:30.670> of<00:00:30.730> your<00:00:30.910> NFC

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
help you get the most out of your NFC

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.950 
help you get the most out of your NFC
experience<00:00:31.980> NFC<00:00:32.980> interactor<00:00:33.699> and<00:00:33.879> NFC<00:00:34.480> launch

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
experience NFC interactor and NFC launch

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.920 
experience NFC interactor and NFC launch
it<00:00:35.290> so<00:00:36.250> first<00:00:36.430> we'll<00:00:36.580> take<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.760> look<00:00:37.030> at<00:00:37.269> NFC

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
it so first we'll take a look at NFC

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.990 
it so first we'll take a look at NFC
interactor<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.870> NFC<00:00:41.140> interactor<00:00:41.979> you<00:00:42.670> can

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
interactor with NFC interactor you can

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.990 
interactor with NFC interactor you can
build<00:00:43.860> tags<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:46.260> NFC<00:00:47.260> tags<00:00:47.650> to<00:00:47.860> work<00:00:48.010> with<00:00:48.220> so

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
build tags for NFC tags to work with so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.030 
build tags for NFC tags to work with so
right<00:00:49.239> here<00:00:49.449> I<00:00:49.479> have<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.750> couple<00:00:50.140> NFC<00:00:50.620> stickers

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
right here I have a couple NFC stickers

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.950 
right here I have a couple NFC stickers
we'll<00:00:51.970> use<00:00:52.210> this<00:00:52.390> one<00:00:52.449> for<00:00:52.809> this

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
we'll use this one for this

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.469 
we'll use this one for this
demonstration<00:00:53.729> and<00:00:54.729> we'll<00:00:55.000> get<00:00:55.150> rid<00:00:55.269> of<00:00:55.330> that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
demonstration and we'll get rid of that

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.049 
demonstration and we'll get rid of that

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
so to make a tag what we're gonna do is

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.009 
so to make a tag what we're gonna do is
gonna<00:00:58.210> hit<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.449> plus<00:00:58.659> button

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
we're gonna look at is called NFC launch

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.339 
we're gonna look at is called NFC launch
it<00:02:29.689> now<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.829> very<00:02:34.159> similar<00:02:35.049> you<00:02:36.049> can

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
it now this one is very similar you can

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.759 
it now this one is very similar you can
choose<00:02:36.769> system<00:02:37.700> settings<00:02:38.180> for<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.319> so

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
choose system settings for it to do so

app now our music let's do a system app
this<00:03:38.540> time

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
this time

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:51.600 
this time
that's<00:03:39.859> do<00:03:41.290> cellular<00:03:42.290> settings<00:03:46.599> same<00:03:47.599> deal

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.040 

there<00:03:52.610> we<00:03:52.700> go<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.730> those<00:03:55.940> are<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.330> NFC<00:03:56.780> apps

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
there we go so those are the NFC apps

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.440 
there we go so those are the NFC apps
for<00:03:57.380> Windows<00:03:57.680> Phone<00:03:57.860> 8<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.850> only<00:03:59.240> real

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
for Windows Phone 8 the only real

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.060 
for Windows Phone 8 the only real
downside<00:03:59.720> is<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.940> can't<00:04:02.590> like<00:04:03.590> if<00:04:03.770> we<00:04:03.890> go

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
downside is that you can't like if we go

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.700 
downside is that you can't like if we go
into<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.880> NFC<00:04:05.330> launcher<00:04:06.050> here<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:08.530> we<00:04:09.530> do

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
into the NFC launcher here and we do

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.199 
into the NFC launcher here and we do
Wi-Fi<00:04:14.500> all<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.740> is<00:04:15.980> ever<00:04:16.190> going<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.580> do<00:04:16.820> is

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
Wi-Fi all this is ever going to do is

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.250 
Wi-Fi all this is ever going to do is
take<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.560> page<00:04:19.900> it's<00:04:20.900> gonna<00:04:21.019> take

take you to this page it's gonna take
you<00:04:21.410> right<00:04:21.440> here<00:04:21.820> now<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:23.090> would<00:04:23.210> be<00:04:23.240> nice<00:04:23.570> if

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
you right here now it would be nice if

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.040 
you right here now it would be nice if
you<00:04:24.710> could<00:04:25.040> tap<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.120> tag<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.960> would

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
you could tap the tag and then it would

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.780 
you could tap the tag and then it would
automatically<00:04:27.650> turn<00:04:28.070> off<00:04:28.460> Wi-Fi<00:04:29.650> without<00:04:30.790> you

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
automatically turn off Wi-Fi without you

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.850 
automatically turn off Wi-Fi without you
having<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.360> anything<00:04:32.600> but<00:04:33.530> with<00:04:33.680> this

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
having to do anything but with this

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.660 
having to do anything but with this
message<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.550> have<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.480> tap<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.170> have<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.340> click

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
message I have to tap it I have to click

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.970 
message I have to tap it I have to click
the<00:04:38.090> accept<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:39.200> then<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.410> have<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.800> click

the accept and then I have to click

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.150 
the accept and then I have to click
Wi-Fi<00:04:40.490> off<00:04:41.290> it's<00:04:42.290> not<00:04:42.530> really<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:42.980> much

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
Wi-Fi off it's not really that much

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.620 
Wi-Fi off it's not really that much
easier<00:04:43.550> because<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.540> can<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:45.650> let's<00:04:46.190> say<00:04:46.630> pin

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
easier because I can just let's say pin

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.590 
easier because I can just let's say pin
this<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.950> gets<00:04:49.070> me<00:04:49.280> there<00:04:49.460> same<00:04:50.300> amount<00:04:50.540> of

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
this and it gets me there same amount of

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.530 
this and it gets me there same amount of
time<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:52.040> that's<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.340> one<00:04:52.460> downside<00:04:52.880> with<00:04:53.090> NFC

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
time so that's the one downside with NFC

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.190 
time so that's the one downside with NFC
and<00:04:53.810> Windows<00:04:54.110> Phone<00:04:54.350> but<00:04:54.850> there<00:04:55.850> is<00:04:56.090> a

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
and Windows Phone but there is a

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.390 
and Windows Phone but there is a
functionality<00:04:57.200> built<00:04:57.320> in<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.860> use<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.220> it

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
functionality built in to use it it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.640 
functionality built in to use it it
works<00:04:58.700> with<00:04:58.970> most<00:04:59.390> of<00:04:59.570> your<00:04:59.690> standard<00:04:59.990> NFC
