doing in the galactic adventures is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.630 
doing in the galactic adventures is
making<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> terraforming<00:00:26.130> tools<00:00:26.369> available

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
making the terraforming tools available

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
making the terraforming tools available
to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> users<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.080> things<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.890> we

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to the users so these are things that we

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.740 
to the users so these are things that we
had<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.970> development<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> spore<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
had in the development of spore that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
had in the development of spore that
basically<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.320> technical<00:00:31.859> artist<00:00:32.219> had<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> do

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
basically a technical artist had to do

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
basically a technical artist had to do
scripting<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.989> we've<00:00:34.110> done<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.410> we

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
scripting to do what we've done is we

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
scripting to do what we've done is we
put<00:00:34.710> some<00:00:34.860> UI<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.340> front<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> made<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
put some UI in front of it and made it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.200 
put some UI in front of it and made it
so<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.840> players<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> really

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so that players can go in and really

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.670 
so that players can go in and really
terraform<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> planet<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.320> their<00:00:40.440> heart's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
terraform the planet to their heart's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920 
terraform the planet to their heart's
content<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.300> lay<00:00:42.899> down

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
content so I can go in and you lay down

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.819 
content so I can go in and you lay down
a<00:00:43.110> river<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:44.520> there's<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.510> river<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.050> then

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
a river and there's my river and then

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.380 
a river and there's my river and then
maybe<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> end<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.579> river<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.090> should

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
maybe at the end of that river I should

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
maybe at the end of that river I should
have<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> notion<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.170> sort<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.059> go

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
have a notion of some sort so I can go

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.939 
have a notion of some sort so I can go
do<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.410> ahead<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.559> make<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
do that and I can go ahead and make that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.819 
do that and I can go ahead and make that
a<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.610> bigger<00:00:53.879> ocean<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.510> decide<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.230> can

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a much bigger ocean if I decide to I can

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.160 
a much bigger ocean if I decide to I can
alter<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.610> atmosphere<00:00:57.300> level<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.960> i<00:00:57.989> can

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
alter the atmosphere level so i can

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
alter the atmosphere level so i can
change<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> atmosphere<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> planet<00:00:59.550> i

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
change the atmosphere of the planet i

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.450 
change the atmosphere of the planet i
can<00:01:00.629> even<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.930> things<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
can even do things like just go in and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.020 
can even do things like just go in and
change<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> color<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> live<00:01:03.510> terrain<00:01:05.030> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
change the color of the live terrain so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
change the color of the live terrain so
what<00:01:06.210> i<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.720> tell<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.350> story<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.860> can
