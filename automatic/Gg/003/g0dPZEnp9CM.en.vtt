protein shake or something like that so
to<00:07:05.220> get<00:07:05.400> bigger<00:07:05.670> I<00:07:05.910> wouldn't<00:07:06.180> worry<00:07:06.330> so<00:07:06.450> much

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
to get bigger I wouldn't worry so much

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.260 
to get bigger I wouldn't worry so much
about<00:07:06.750> the<00:07:07.080> prohormones<00:07:07.740> although<00:07:08.150> you<00:07:09.150> know

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
about the prohormones although you know

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.760 
about the prohormones although you know
that's<00:07:09.510> kind<00:07:09.720> of<00:07:09.780> up<00:07:10.140> for<00:07:10.350> debate<00:07:10.440> whether

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
that's kind of up for debate whether

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.170 
that's kind of up for debate whether
they're<00:07:11.010> effective<00:07:11.430> or<00:07:11.550> not<00:07:11.610> I<00:07:11.910> don't<00:07:12.060> really

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
they're effective or not I don't really

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.070 
they're effective or not I don't really
know<00:07:12.390> I<00:07:12.420> don't<00:07:12.480> really<00:07:12.630> try<00:07:12.960> them<00:07:13.170> um<00:07:14.510> but<00:07:15.510> I

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
know I don't really try them um but I

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.170 
know I don't really try them um but I
what<00:07:17.010> I<00:07:17.040> would<00:07:17.310> say<00:07:17.550> is<00:07:17.730> that<00:07:17.880> it's<00:07:18.030> going<00:07:18.120> to

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
what I would say is that it's going to

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.000 
what I would say is that it's going to
come<00:07:18.420> through<00:07:18.450> your<00:07:18.690> diet<00:07:18.930> it's<00:07:19.590> not<00:07:19.800> going<00:07:19.920> to
