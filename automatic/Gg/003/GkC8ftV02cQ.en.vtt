00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.730 
guess run out of range but who is
seriously<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.929> micro<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.440> when

it's just silly how blatantly hard
counters<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.699> game<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.660> guys

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
counters in this game are these guys

aren't even attacking down there coaches
are<00:01:03.030> getting<00:01:03.300> possible<00:01:03.960> damage<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
are getting possible damage so there are

are getting possible damage so there are
20<00:01:05.010> damage<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> frenzy<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.420> aren't

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
still I don't see frenzy seeing much

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
still I don't see frenzy seeing much
play<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.090> hydra<00:01:12.930> roach<00:01:13.590> army<00:01:15.229> next<00:01:16.229> up

play in a hydra roach army next up
overseers<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.490> bit<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:17.850> useful

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
overseers got a little bit more useful

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
overseers got a little bit more useful
they<00:01:18.450> still<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> changeling<00:01:19.350> yourself

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
they still have the changeling yourself

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
they still have the changeling yourself
200<00:01:20.040> live<00:01:20.159> 200<00:01:20.549> energy<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.270> stuff

200 live 200 energy all that good stuff

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
200 live 200 energy all that good stuff
but<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.439> contaminate<00:01:23.100> which<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
but they now have contaminate which is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
but they now have contaminate which is
very<00:01:23.580> similar<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> corrupt<00:01:24.479> ability<00:01:24.869> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
very similar to the corrupt ability in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.280 
very similar to the corrupt ability in
that<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.369> used<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.729> structures<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:28.049> will

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that it is used on structures it will

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.670 
that it is used on structures it will
disable<00:01:28.619> units<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.780> researching<00:01:30.780> units

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
disable units and researching units

seconds<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.810> most<00:01:36.810> useful

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
seconds but one of the most useful

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.319 
seconds but one of the most useful
applications<00:01:37.860> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.640> disable<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
planetary fortress it will still blow up

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
planetary fortress it will still blow up
anything<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.040> sees<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.289 
only difference is they cost a hundred
more<00:01:52.110> energy<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
more energy what is up with that that is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.780 
more energy what is up with that that is
just<00:01:54.420> bollocks<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.670> only

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
just bollocks right there and the only

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.550 
just bollocks right there and the only
use<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.329> these<00:01:57.479> infested<00:01:57.899> terrans<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.350> be

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
use for these infested terrans will be

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.399 
use for these infested terrans will be
to<00:01:58.829> harass<00:01:59.159> mineral<00:01:59.670> lines<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.290> know

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to harass mineral lines and you know

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.020 
to harass mineral lines and you know
maybe<00:02:01.560> drop<00:02:01.890> over<00:02:02.130> some<00:02:02.280> tanks<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> cause<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
maybe drop over some tanks to cause the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.459 
maybe drop over some tanks to cause the
tanks<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> kill<00:02:03.600> each<00:02:03.719> other<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.990> don't<00:02:04.350> know

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
tanks to kill each other I don't know

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.030 
tanks to kill each other I don't know
but<00:02:04.770> we'll<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.250> here

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
but we'll see here

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.070 
but we'll see here
they<00:02:06.220> poop<00:02:06.430> my<00:02:06.610> out<00:02:06.730> right<00:02:07.480> over<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.780> mineral

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
they poop my out right over the mineral

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.560 
they poop my out right over the mineral
lines<00:02:08.259> same<00:02:08.890> damage<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.520> my<00:02:09.700> Fez<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.450> old

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.180 
lines same damage in my Fez the old
infested<00:02:11.020> terrans<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.560> let's<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:11.800> pick<00:02:12.040> up

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
infested terrans and let's just pick up

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.960 
infested terrans and let's just pick up
some<00:02:12.370> SUVs<00:02:13.740> but<00:02:14.740> not<00:02:14.950> too<00:02:15.160> fascinating<00:02:15.850> at

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
some SUVs but not too fascinating at

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.210 
some SUVs but not too fascinating at
least<00:02:16.120> overseers<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:17.080> know<00:02:17.200> got<00:02:17.500> something

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
least overseers you know got something

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.860 
least overseers you know got something
kind<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.850> cool<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.060> guess<00:02:19.330> they're<00:02:19.630> going<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> be

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
kind of cool I guess they're going to be

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.630 
kind of cool I guess they're going to be
very<00:02:20.140> nice<00:02:20.380> for<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.740> contaminate<00:02:21.460> on

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
very nice for the contaminate on

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.100 
very nice for the contaminate on
production<00:02:22.210> buildings<00:02:22.540> i<00:02:22.690> will<00:02:22.870> say<00:02:23.050> that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.390 

next<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.200> just<00:02:26.380> want<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.590> demonstrate<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:27.100> little

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
next I just want to demonstrate a little

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.030 
next I just want to demonstrate a little
bit<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.700> one-on-one<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.500> ultralisks

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
bit of one-on-one with the ultralisks

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.920 
bit of one-on-one with the ultralisks
against<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> other<00:02:30.970> massive<00:02:31.390> units<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.810> how

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
against the other massive units and how

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.350 
against the other massive units and how
they<00:02:32.080> will<00:02:32.230> fare<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.460> ultra<00:02:33.790> verse<00:02:34.000> Thor

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
they will fare but the ultra verse Thor

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.180 
they will fare but the ultra verse Thor
that<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.660> not<00:02:34.840> using<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> strike<00:02:35.530> cannon<00:02:35.950> it's

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
that is not using the strike cannon it's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.760 
that is not using the strike cannon it's
actually<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.610> very<00:02:36.880> close<00:02:37.240> match<00:02:37.270> up<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:41.500> course

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
actually a very close match up of course

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.170 
actually a very close match up of course
you<00:02:41.920> can't<00:02:42.160> really<00:02:42.280> follow<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.880> achieve

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
you can't really follow this to achieve

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.970 
you can't really follow this to achieve
because<00:02:43.450> ultras<00:02:44.140> are<00:02:44.320> not<00:02:44.560> meant<00:02:44.830> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
because ultras are not meant to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.530 
because ultras are not meant to
one-on-one<00:02:45.190> units<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.270> meant<00:02:46.450> for

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
one-on-one units they are more meant for

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.600 
one-on-one units they are more meant for
splash<00:02:46.990> damage<00:02:47.230> against<00:02:47.740> armored<00:02:48.100> units<00:02:48.400> so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
splash damage against armored units so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.120 
splash damage against armored units so
not<00:02:49.360> surprising<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.990> ultra<00:02:50.200> lost<00:02:50.410> lost<00:02:50.800> but

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
not surprising the ultra lost lost but

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.880 
not surprising the ultra lost lost but
the<00:02:51.310> damage<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.850> very<00:02:52.120> nice<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.410> damage<00:02:53.650> is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the damage is very nice so the damage is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.310 
the damage is very nice so the damage is
a<00:02:54.160> nice<00:02:54.820> upgrade<00:02:55.030> against<00:02:55.390> armored<00:02:55.750> units<00:02:56.050> but

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
a nice upgrade against armored units but

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.080 
a nice upgrade against armored units but
they<00:02:56.709> will<00:02:56.860> never<00:02:56.950> get<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.370> situation<00:02:57.550> will

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
they will never get in a situation will

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.729 
they will never get in a situation will
where<00:02:58.480> they<00:02:58.600> will<00:02:58.810> get<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.320> be<00:02:59.500> down<00:02:59.709> a

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
where they will get to just be down a

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.800 
where they will get to just be down a
bunch<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.100> army<00:03:00.310> units<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.510> isn't<00:03:01.780> really

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
bunch of army units so this isn't really

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.360 
bunch of army units so this isn't really
relevant<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.590> kind<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.950> reference<00:03:03.130> point

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
relevant just kind of a reference point

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.580 
relevant just kind of a reference point
for<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.730> guys<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.060> guess<00:03:04.270> against<00:03:05.230> an<00:03:05.350> immortal

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
for you guys I guess against an immortal

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.930 
for you guys I guess against an immortal
of<00:03:05.890> course<00:03:06.100> not<00:03:06.340> going<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.580> do<00:03:06.670> very<00:03:06.700> well

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
of course not going to do very well

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.400 
of course not going to do very well
because<00:03:07.360> your<00:03:07.510> model<00:03:07.810> does<00:03:07.989> have<00:03:08.230> those

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
because your model does have those

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.009 
because your model does have those
hardened<00:03:08.830> shields<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:10.390> immortal<00:03:10.750> much

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
hardened shields and the immortal much

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.500 
hardened shields and the immortal much
much<00:03:11.260> cheaper<00:03:11.340> units<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.580> able<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> destroy

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
much cheaper units and able to destroy

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.870 
much cheaper units and able to destroy
that<00:03:13.720> ultralisk<00:03:14.200> right<00:03:14.650> there<00:03:14.890> finally

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
that ultralisk right there finally

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.820 
that ultralisk right there finally
against<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.239> Colossus<00:03:16.690> Colossus<00:03:17.230> is<00:03:17.260> role<00:03:17.620> is

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
against the Colossus Colossus is role is

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.470 
against the Colossus Colossus is role is
definitely<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.580> one-on-one<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
definitely not a one-on-one so the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.350 
definitely not a one-on-one so the
classes<00:03:19.840> will<00:03:20.050> get<00:03:20.260> dedicated<00:03:20.830> here<00:03:22.500> boom<00:03:24.360> so

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
classes will get dedicated here boom so

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.690 
classes will get dedicated here boom so
ultra<00:03:25.750> does<00:03:25.989> own<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.440> Colossus<00:03:26.950> but<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.580> can

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
ultra does own the Colossus but you can

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.430 
ultra does own the Colossus but you can
get<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.910> Colossus<00:03:28.330> about<00:03:28.540> two<00:03:28.780> hours<00:03:28.989> sooner

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
get the Colossus about two hours sooner

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.009 
get the Colossus about two hours sooner
than<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.920> ultra<00:03:30.190> list<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.580> doesn't<00:03:30.880> matter

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
than the ultra list so it doesn't matter

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.240 
than the ultra list so it doesn't matter
finally<00:03:32.019> going<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.200> use<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.440> ultralisk<00:03:32.860> just

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
finally going to use the ultralisk just

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.100 
finally going to use the ultralisk just
for<00:03:33.970> some<00:03:34.150> fun<00:03:34.480> on<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:35.280> marauder<00:03:36.280> army<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.930> is

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
for some fun on a marauder army this is

me<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.770> other<00:04:13.980> forces<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:15.090> other

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
me with the other forces the other

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.360 
me with the other forces the other
forces<00:04:15.630> will<00:04:15.900> always<00:04:16.200> be<00:04:16.320> behind<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.890> ultras

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
forces will always be behind the ultras

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.729 
forces will always be behind the ultras
so<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:18.150> can<00:04:18.329> still<00:04:18.570> kite<00:04:18.870> them<00:04:19.079> really<00:04:19.620> no

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
so you can still kite them really no

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.580 
so you can still kite them really no
matter<00:04:19.769> what<00:04:20.310> kind<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.549> micro<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:20.970> have<00:04:21.150> or

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
matter what kind of micro you have or

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.260 
matter what kind of micro you have or
what<00:04:22.590> other<00:04:22.770> forces<00:04:23.160> are<00:04:23.490> included<00:04:23.910> with<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
what other forces are included with the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.210 
what other forces are included with the
ultras<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.580> it's<00:04:26.580> just<00:04:27.390> kind<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.660> silly<00:04:28.220> but

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
ultras so it's just kind of silly but

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.340 
ultras so it's just kind of silly but
they<00:04:29.669> are<00:04:29.730> still<00:04:30.000> useless<00:04:30.270> against<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:30.960> army

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
they are still useless against this army

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.530 
they are still useless against this army
as<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.860> see<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.910> times<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.240> they<00:04:33.419> are

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
as you can see the times that they are

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.880 
as you can see the times that they are
fighting<00:04:33.780> off<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:33.990> creep<00:04:34.229> and<00:04:34.440> you'll<00:04:34.560> notice

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
fighting off the creep and you'll notice

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.730 
fighting off the creep and you'll notice
they<00:04:35.310> did<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.610> fix<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.180> bug<00:04:36.930> or<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.290> think<00:04:37.440> it's

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
they did not fix the bug or I think it's

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.980 
they did not fix the bug or I think it's
a<00:04:37.800> bug<00:04:37.979> where<00:04:38.550> ultras<00:04:38.940> will<00:04:39.120> actually<00:04:39.510> miss<00:04:39.750> a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
a bug where ultras will actually miss a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.140 
a bug where ultras will actually miss a
unit<00:04:40.350> when<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> unit<00:04:40.889> runs<00:04:41.160> away<00:04:41.580> after<00:04:42.060> they

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
unit when the unit runs away after they

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.180 
unit when the unit runs away after they
start<00:04:42.389> their<00:04:42.510> attack<00:04:42.600> animation<00:04:43.320> let's<00:04:44.010> check

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
start their attack animation let's check

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.120 
start their attack animation let's check
out<00:04:44.400> if<00:04:44.639> they<00:04:44.850> are<00:04:45.000> able<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.300> be<00:04:45.840> owned<00:04:46.800> that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
out if they are able to be owned that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.920 
out if they are able to be owned that
much<00:04:47.370> on<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.760> creep<00:04:48.090> here<00:04:48.330> where<00:04:48.510> alters<00:04:48.780> are

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
much on the creep here where alters are

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.810 
much on the creep here where alters are
fast<00:04:49.169> keep<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:49.890> mind<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.220> ultras<00:04:50.520> do<00:04:50.640> have

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
fast keep in mind the ultras do have

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.600 
fast keep in mind the ultras do have
their<00:04:50.970> speed<00:04:51.240> upgrade

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.950 

and<00:04:57.610> ultra<00:04:57.970> are<00:04:58.180> still<00:04:58.480> missing<00:04:58.660> their

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
and ultra are still missing their

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.170 
and ultra are still missing their
attacks<00:04:59.230> even<00:04:59.500> on<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.920> creep<00:05:00.250> so<00:05:00.970> they<00:05:01.120> are

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
attacks even on the creep so they are

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.810 
attacks even on the creep so they are
still<00:05:01.420> very<00:05:01.630> Qaeda<00:05:01.990> both<00:05:02.280> they're<00:05:03.280> just<00:05:03.310> not

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
still very Qaeda both they're just not

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.340 
still very Qaeda both they're just not
going<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.060> be<00:05:04.120> trained<00:05:04.420> these<00:05:04.660> guys<00:05:04.900> only<00:05:05.110> one

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
going to be trained these guys only one

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.040 
going to be trained these guys only one
of<00:05:05.440> them<00:05:05.530> didn't<00:05:05.800> have<00:05:05.920> stem<00:05:06.220> but<00:05:06.900> you'll<00:05:07.900> see

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
of them didn't have stem but you'll see

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.360 
of them didn't have stem but you'll see
they're<00:05:08.200> getting<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.500> range<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.010> if<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:09.160> cut

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
they're getting in range so if you cut

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.680 
they're getting in range so if you cut
down<00:05:09.400> one<00:05:09.730> they<00:05:09.910> were<00:05:10.000> getting<00:05:10.120> in<00:05:10.300> range<00:05:10.480> but

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
down one they were getting in range but

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.390 
down one they were getting in range but
they<00:05:10.840> were<00:05:10.900> missing<00:05:11.290> even<00:05:11.500> on<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.770> creep<00:05:11.980> with

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
they were missing even on the creep with

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.390 
they were missing even on the creep with
stimpack<00:05:12.940> you<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:14.710> can't<00:05:14.920> use<00:05:15.070> ultra<00:05:15.340> as

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
stimpack you just can't use ultra as

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.000 
stimpack you just can't use ultra as
