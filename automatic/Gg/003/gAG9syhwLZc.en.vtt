00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.170
 I really like the typical life 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.060

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.080
 exactly of American life but 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.809
 from another point of view from the point 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.580
 of a guy like me who sees the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.230
 tele that you see in American movies and 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.000
 which is the typical American family that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.650
 we can talk about this topic because there 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.470
 behind or not apart from many other things 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.090
 because behind I have a clue in the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.489
 wall a kind of map to go all the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.379
 world is black and white and about 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.239
 member states and I'm reminded to remember 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.000
 this topic really one day their offspring 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.020
 and here he warned me today talking about the subject and 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.300
 good let's start the typical American life 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.690
 we can start where we can 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.270
 start by the typical American father the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.030
 typical American father a works of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.790
 office worker or something of the style has a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.790
 good car and has a two-story house 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.140
 with a little garden and an American lover 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 typical 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.729
 and how not to forget the weapons 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 Americans have weapons always 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.689
 they have weapons everywhere they are 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.330
 full of weapons so when the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.590
 father of the family hears a strange noise 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.890
 Take a shotgun out of the pillow 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.630
 the ladder and when you see the typical 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.250
 neighbor who sneaks into the house by the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.149
 face in African movies the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.810
 scare I see them shooting in everything in the head 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.390
 the American mother the American mother does not 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.789

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.150
 the children buy the bridges to the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.819
 children talk to their children when they have 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.120
 problems and everything you do 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.799
 the typical American son 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.690
 and before I start I'm going to say that 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.230
 Americans always have two children one 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.330

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.349

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.290
 talk about the typical American school 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.109
 ok let's do it from the point of 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.329
 sight of the older brother first the 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.250

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.690

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.530
