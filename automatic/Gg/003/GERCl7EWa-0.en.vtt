00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello goodbye that does not leave a the king of the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.490
 drums 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.740
 procedure in this second installment 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.290
 let's talk about a procedure that 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.230
 is quite extreme in reality and that 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.850
 Well I advise it only when it is 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.490
 necessary that is the procedure for 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.170
 calibrate your computer's battery 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.580
 or your cell phone or your gps or any 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.200
 another lithium-ion battery have in 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.660
 account that lithium-ion batteries are 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.610
 the rechargeable batteries present in 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.360
 practically any device 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.680
 modern except 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:55.750
 except for the batteries of the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 cordless phones that for some 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.930
 reason 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.870
 they are still many times of nickel-cadmium 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.470
 [Music] 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.720
 the reason would explain the reason 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.270
 I think it's explain in another in another 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 video possibly but in this case what 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 what we are going to talk about is the calibration 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.330
 then the batteries when I should 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.619
 calibrate the battery of my computer or 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.009
 the battery of my cell phone when that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.420
 only when my cell phone or my 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 computer goes out unexpectedly still 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 indicating 10 15 20 30 percent 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.970
 charge that because internally happens 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 batteries usually have the battery of the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.210
 computers and then that cell level 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 cellular the symmetry of consumers 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.060
 they also count to an internal sensor of 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.929
 load this sensor sites calibrate for a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 improper use of the battery let's say 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.840
 I could charge the battery in a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 high load percentage by putting 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.400
 charge the battery when it is a 60 70 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.340
 80 percent 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.539
 des calibrate that sensor plus that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.250
 let's continue the battery life 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.769
 so what we have to do is 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.659
 primarily avoid this as putting 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.219
 to charge the battery when the system 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.349
 operative of our cell phones or 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.299
 computers or gps did not 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.049
 that is usually about the day of 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.840
 15% if you do not let go, let us get to the 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.939
 1% and less that it turns off completely and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.459
 the last last last thing that 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.769
 we can do is let it be downloaded 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.900
 completely and put that device in 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.629
 a drawer because what we do is 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.040
 we kill the battery well we have the 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.180
 calibrated authorities we have a 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.870
 careless we leave our device 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.900
 a few months and a few months not a few years 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.640
 a few months in a drawer with the battery 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.040
 put on the outside that is pretty much what 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.439
 same and the battery was discharged as 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.090
 we solve this problem that we give ourselves 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.019
 account that the calibrated battery studies 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.790
 we are going to do it 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.270
 if we perceive that he is really 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.720
 decalibrated what we do is 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.160
 [Music] 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 we charge the battery up to 100% 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 We assure you that it is 100% or we are 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.310
 we passed a little in time 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.290
 the device indicating that you have the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.420
 100% or we load more hours than those 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.580
 we know that it is necessary not to 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.930
 week charging the battery is not a 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.730
 computer battery that is charged in 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.100
 two hours or three hours we put 5 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.920
 hours 6 hours that you acquire 100% of 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.590
 load then we let download by 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.560
 full 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.600
 and then we reload it by 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.400
 full 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.560
 and once you have the total load that 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.480
 we went from 0 to 100 percent real of what 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.590
 which is the battery at that time as well 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.420
 that the battery may have lost 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.820
 aside its capacity but we are going to have 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.910
 the real 0 with the full download and the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.500
 100% real with full battery that 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.150
 we know that it is really full that it does not 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.940
 is that the indicator tells us that it is a 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.590
 100% that we know is 100% of what 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.690
 that battery has at that moment of 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.200
 capacity because we are we are 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.020
 going on in time without understanding 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.600
 So what we achieve with that is that 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.960
 the sensor knows what is zero and what is 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.550
 100% and from there you can 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.400
 set the scale again and you can 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.050
 know at what moment you have to charge 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.080
 how do we do this the part that I have not 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.420
 explained the total discharge is done 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.750
 also many hours you 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.110
 they have a cell phone 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.570
 let's put this story as always 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.200
 there is only doubt that this story 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.500
 blackberry 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.540
 the battery is completely derived 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.380
 If I leave it inside the cell phone, not the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.360
 retired in no time that six hours 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.820
 eight hours in a computer battery 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.950
 more time and soon 12 hours if a 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.780
 long time because what happens when 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.760
 the battery is still inside the device 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.010
 that gets them the device that they 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.440
 continues to drain a little load us 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.540
 we ensure in that way that really if 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.340
 we removed the battery then still 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.040
 keep a little bit we make sure that 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.380
 the zero is the absolute zero of charge and 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.330
 then that we do what we 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.669
 we were talking so bring 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.640
 up to 100 percent real still 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.650
 happening to us that way today we have 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.190
 solved the problem of the 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.300
 battery calibration good friends 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.800
 we will continue with these videos so that 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.360
 keep learning some of you 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.710
 will sell batteries or sell 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.840
 devices that have batteries or 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.310
 they want to take care of their batteries for this is 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.240
 to help them be very well up 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.450
 the next 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.450
 bye
