dad<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.199> finished<00:00:31.679> fixing<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.700> table

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
dad and I just finished fixing the table

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
dad and I just finished fixing the table
legs<00:00:33.800> we<00:00:34.800> put<00:00:34.980> new<00:00:35.130> table<00:00:35.489> legs<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.880> because

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
legs we put new table legs on it because

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.990 
legs we put new table legs on it because
before<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.719> had<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.200> tiny<00:00:38.000> little

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
before we had these little tiny little

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780 
before we had these little tiny little
tiny<00:00:39.300> pieces<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> wood<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:41.520> going

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
tiny pieces of wood which was not going

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.010 
tiny pieces of wood which was not going
to<00:00:41.910> cut<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.300> hold<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> milling

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to cut it so now can hold up the milling

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
to cut it so now can hold up the milling
machine<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.500> everything<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
machine and everything that was on the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.889 
machine and everything that was on the
table<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> moved<00:00:48.480> around

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
table kind of moved around

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.920 
table kind of moved around
I<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.829> drill<00:00:50.190> press<00:00:50.399> over<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.090> along

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
I have drill press over here now along

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.270 
I have drill press over here now along
with<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.230> lathe<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:54.469> just<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.949> threw

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
with the lathe and just I just threw

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.020 
with the lathe and just I just threw
everything<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:58.160> I'm<00:00:59.160> gonna<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.460> an

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
everything over here but I'm gonna do an

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
everything over here but I'm gonna do an
unboxing<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.230> necessarily<00:01:01.530> unboxing

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
unboxing not not necessarily unboxing

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
unboxing not not necessarily unboxing
but<00:01:02.579> it'll<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.390> yes<00:01:03.629> probably<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> series

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
but it'll just be yes probably a series

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
but it'll just be yes probably a series
of<00:01:04.650> pictures<00:01:04.860> after<00:01:05.489> I'm<00:01:05.820> done<00:01:06.119> talking<00:01:06.570> here

of pictures after I'm done talking here

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:17.080 
of pictures after I'm done talking here
of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.860> milling<00:01:08.400> machine<00:01:08.460> through<00:01:09.000> its<00:01:09.119> steps

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:02:08.050

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
hey guys on the back the milling machine

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.000 
hey guys on the back the milling machine
is<00:02:11.900> all<00:02:12.200> put<00:02:12.440> together<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.430> new<00:02:17.330> table

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
is all put together and is a new table

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.340 
is all put together and is a new table
um<00:02:19.010> I'm<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.730> I'm<00:02:20.180> just<00:02:20.390> gonna<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.020> just

the bubbling some stuff soon because I
will<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.570> working<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.650> some<00:02:36.680> projects<00:02:37.130> right

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
will be working in some projects right

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.740 
will be working in some projects right
away<00:02:37.490> because<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:39.550> need<00:02:40.550> those<00:02:41.030> projects<00:02:41.570> need

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
away because I need those projects need

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.979 
away because I need those projects need
the<00:02:42.020> milling<00:02:42.290> machine<00:02:42.320> so<00:02:43.660> here's<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.720> like

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
the milling machine so here's just like

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.199 
the milling machine so here's just like
a<00:02:45.050> little<00:02:45.200> size<00:02:45.440> comparison<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:47.060> might

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
a little size comparison like you might

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.970 
a little size comparison like you might
know<00:02:47.360> it's<00:02:47.750> pretty<00:02:47.870> big<00:02:48.140> that's<00:02:48.530> my<00:02:48.709> hand

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
know it's pretty big that's my hand

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.400 
know it's pretty big that's my hand
right<00:02:49.970> up<00:02:50.090> against<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.510> obviously<00:02:51.170> it's<00:02:51.320> my

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
right up against it obviously it's my

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.800 
right up against it obviously it's my
hand<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:51.770> um<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.209> pretty<00:02:53.239> big<00:02:53.600> machine

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
hand but um it's a pretty big machine

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.050 
hand but um it's a pretty big machine
actually<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.040> lot<00:02:55.190> bigger<00:02:55.400> than<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.820> high

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
actually it's a lot bigger than the high

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.150 
actually it's a lot bigger than the high
drill<00:02:56.360> press<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.959> think<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.650> drill<00:02:57.920> press<00:02:58.130> is

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
drill press I think the drill press is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.890 
drill press I think the drill press is
only<00:02:58.430> about<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:58.940> tall<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.540> it<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.900> it's

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
only about this tall on it so it's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.860 
only about this tall on it so it's
pretty<00:03:03.020> cool<00:03:03.850> please<00:03:04.850> write<00:03:05.090> comments<00:03:05.630> cried

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
pretty cool please write comments cried

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.010 
pretty cool please write comments cried
for<00:03:06.620> future<00:03:07.070> videos<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.540> milling

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
for future videos and of the milling

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.580 
for future videos and of the milling
machine<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.410> I'll<00:03:09.739> see<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:09.980> guys<00:03:10.070> later<00:03:10.130> bye
