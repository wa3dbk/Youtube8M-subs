 How many clans and vulgar numbers are there, but casks and vulgarities 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.470
 Clanmaster is that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.270

 It is a fact that there is only ability, but it's really bad, though it's bad to say that Sami-chan or that name 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.840
 Cassian

 Said Rokka 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.490
 Yamamasa has nothing to do with doing a grand 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.880
 Well, everyone will read it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.190
 1 I would like Taha Taki Taki can I found the other village factors 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.110
 Then you should go in the opposite direction to those who substituted that mountain 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.650
 It is a flower that is expected in 4 people 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.690
 Okay case is that apprenticeship in the us 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.800
 So this is because of mountain p 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.370
 I have nothing to do with Scrum's fame and Kamea. 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.670
 It's not because I was beaten but because of the mountain p 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.150
 For so Yoneyama's I'm 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.150
 That 's right 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.180

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.100
 Now p is 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.490
 Since the position is made to exit on the other radar it's a good child 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.290
 killed soon Once eap is resurrected 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.040

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.290
 Chain softening 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.049
 It hits more and more generator Edo Toka Rokeran 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.980
 I think that it is good in the form that seems to come down the locale that can not fall immediately after division 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.980

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.990

 Really Sami-chan's name is known Usa-chan is really trash 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.040
 Yes, but I're really strong 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.650
 That's if the next will go, if that is not you think home star's net 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.650
 It is safe to say once or twice after knowing 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.060
 By the moon and the safety 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.050
