00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
looks like the Total Recall remake is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.500 
looks like the Total Recall remake is
like<00:01:46.100> 10<00:01:46.280> years<00:01:46.460> past<00:01:46.760> its<00:01:47.000> time<00:01:47.210> at<00:01:47.420> this

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
like 10 years past its time at this

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
point I didn't like feeling like that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.590 
point I didn't like feeling like that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
maybe this is all like in my

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.600 
maybe this is all like in my
subconscious<00:02:03.380> who<00:02:03.650> knows<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.100> among<00:02:04.340> all<00:02:04.520> of

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
subconscious who knows but among all of

that<00:02:46.520> was<00:02:46.640> still<00:02:46.880> cool<00:02:47.150> I'm<00:02:47.420> just<00:02:47.540> saying<00:02:47.750> when

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
that was still cool I'm just saying when

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.360

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
they remake a movie I have to think to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.100

myself<00:02:49.459> could<00:02:49.970> they<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.540> remake<00:02:50.870> that's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
myself could they make a remake that's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.510 
myself could they make a remake that's
better<00:02:51.350> than<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> old<00:02:51.860> one<00:02:52.070> when<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> heard

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520
