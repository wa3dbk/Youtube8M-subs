just make sure you know what the GU 10
is<00:00:29.929> that<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.070> bulbs<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.550> look<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.940> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
is that is the bulbs that look like this

the bottom you push it into the socket
and<00:00:37.230> give<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.829> slight<00:00:38.100> twist<00:00:38.550> about<00:00:38.760> an

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and give it a very slight twist about an

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.549 
and give it a very slight twist about an
eighth<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> turn<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:41.520> lock<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> place<00:00:42.920> the

eighth of a turn to lock it in place the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.720 
eighth of a turn to lock it in place the
most<00:00:46.559> important<00:00:47.039> thing<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.250> need<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> know

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
most important thing you need to know

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
most important thing you need to know
about<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.590> give<00:00:49.829> enough

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
about these is will they give enough

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
about these is will they give enough
light<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:52.289> helped

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
light and that these actually helped

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
light and that these actually helped
here<00:00:52.860> by<00:00:53.100> fact<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> manufacturer<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
here by fact that the manufacturer is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.799 
here by fact that the manufacturer is
prepared<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> declare<00:00:56.030> their<00:00:57.030> luminous<00:00:57.539> flux

and luminous intensity and the numbers

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.660 
and luminous intensity and the numbers
you<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.739> around<00:01:02.100> 170<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> 200<00:01:03.600> lumens

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
will produce as well and these plug into

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
will produce as well and these plug into
and<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:20.520> require<00:01:20.820> anything<00:01:21.150> else<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.689> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and don't require anything else you just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.480 
and don't require anything else you just
simply<00:01:22.020> push<00:01:22.320> them<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> sockets<00:01:23.340> they

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
simply push them into the sockets they

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
simply push them into the sockets they
run<00:01:23.670> off<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> 240<00:01:24.689> volt<00:01:24.900> mains<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> can

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
run off the 240 volt mains as you can

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.460 
run off the 240 volt mains as you can
see<00:01:25.920> 220<00:01:26.820> 240<00:01:27.270> volts<00:01:27.689> that's<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.049> our<00:01:28.229> mains

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
see 220 240 volts that's what our mains

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.450

CEO proved which is very important from
your<00:01:34.920> insurance<00:01:35.270> perspective<00:01:36.740> now<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> know

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
your insurance perspective now I know

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.170 
your insurance perspective now I know
you<00:01:38.070> love<00:01:38.310> seeing<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> price<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.030> these

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you love seeing the price of these

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.910 
you love seeing the price of these
things<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.950> cheap<00:01:41.250> certainly<00:01:42.090> however

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
things and not cheap certainly however

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.170 
things and not cheap certainly however
what<00:01:43.920> you've<00:01:44.040> got<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> compare<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.759> two<00:01:44.939> things

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
what you've got to compare is two things

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
what you've got to compare is two things
quickly<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> fact<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.740> only

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
quickly what is the fact that they only

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.850 
quickly what is the fact that they only
use<00:01:47.130> 4<00:01:47.460> watts<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.880> electricity<00:01:48.240> versus<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> 35

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
use 4 watts of electricity versus the 35

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
use 4 watts of electricity versus the 35
to<00:01:50.220> 40<00:01:50.729> watts<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.329> would<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.630> used<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to 40 watts that you would have used in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.399 
to 40 watts that you would have used in
the<00:01:52.229> existing<00:01:52.740> bulbs<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.840> secondly

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the existing bulbs and that secondly

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.969 
the existing bulbs and that secondly
they<00:01:55.950> last<00:01:56.250> 50,000<00:01:57.149> hours<00:01:57.479> well<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.799> about

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
they last 50,000 hours well that's about

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.789 
they last 50,000 hours well that's about
nearly<00:01:59.880> eight<00:02:00.060> years<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.659> they're<00:02:00.810> left<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.200> 24

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
nearly eight years if they're left on 24

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.280 
nearly eight years if they're left on 24
hours<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.159> day<00:02:02.189> 7<00:02:02.640> days<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.850> week<00:02:03.000> 365<00:02:03.780> days<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.180 
hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a
year<00:02:05.540> very<00:02:06.540> few<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> us<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
year very few of us do that and so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.580 
year very few of us do that and so
basically<00:02:08.369> these<00:02:09.270> bulbs<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.869> probably<00:02:10.289> at

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
basically these bulbs will probably at

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.170 
basically these bulbs will probably at
last<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> amount<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.730> you're<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.060> to

two factors together put a little
spreadsheet<00:02:24.390> together<00:02:24.930> which<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.260> also

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
show you just for say three bulbs in

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.240 
show you just for say three bulbs in
this<00:02:34.800> case<00:02:35.240> how<00:02:36.240> quickly<00:02:36.630> they<00:02:37.350> pay<00:02:37.620> back<00:02:37.920> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
this case how quickly they pay back and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.460 
this case how quickly they pay back and
also<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.300> fact<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.690> these<00:02:40.200> bulbs

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
also the fact because these bulbs

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.360 
also the fact because these bulbs
halland<00:02:41.310> halogen<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:41.940> dichroic<00:02:42.630> bulbs<00:02:43.080> pop<00:02:43.440> at

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
halland halogen or dichroic bulbs pop at

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.620 
halland halogen or dichroic bulbs pop at
least<00:02:44.790> once<00:02:45.090> or<00:02:45.270> twice<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.780> year<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.970> they

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
least once or twice a year and and they

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.090 
least once or twice a year and and they
give<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> better<00:02:51.260> life<00:02:52.260> span<00:02:52.590> obviously

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
give you a better life span obviously

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.729 
give you a better life span obviously
and<00:02:53.340> combining<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> lifespan<00:02:54.540> plus<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.260> very

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and combining the lifespan plus the very

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.949 
and combining the lifespan plus the very
low<00:02:55.920> energy<00:02:56.070> costs<00:02:56.730> means<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.630> within<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
low energy costs means that within a

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.600 
low energy costs means that within a
couple<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.260> years<00:02:58.320> on<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.980> three<00:02:59.250> bulbs

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
couple of years on just three bulbs

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.060 
couple of years on just three bulbs
you're<00:02:59.910> paying<00:03:00.150> back<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:01.170> you've<00:03:01.769> got<00:03:01.950> the
