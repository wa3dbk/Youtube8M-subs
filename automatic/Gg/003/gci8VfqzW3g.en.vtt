won't be able to spawn that's pretty

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:16.080 
won't be able to spawn that's pretty
much<00:07:12.280> it<00:07:12.430> so<00:07:12.610> you<00:07:12.729> just<00:07:12.940> file<00:07:13.389> save<00:07:14.909> cause<00:07:15.909> that

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
much it so you just file save cause that

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.490 
much it so you just file save cause that
out<00:07:16.210> and<00:07:16.479> you<00:07:16.900> open<00:07:17.110> up<00:07:17.169> your<00:07:17.229> server<00:07:17.530> again<00:07:19.500> it

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
out and you open up your server again it

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.779 
out and you open up your server again it
should<00:07:20.680> load<00:07:20.830> up<00:07:20.860> a<00:07:21.009> little<00:07:21.159> bit<00:07:21.250> faster<00:07:21.669> this

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:21.789 
should load up a little bit faster this

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:35.490 
should load up a little bit faster this
time<00:07:32.759> and<00:07:33.759> once<00:07:34.690> this<00:07:34.810> loads<00:07:34.990> up<00:07:35.199> to<00:07:35.229> one-half

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.500 
time and once this loads up to one-half

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.110 
time and once this loads up to one-half
percent<00:07:35.680> your<00:07:36.159> server<00:07:36.430> should<00:07:36.669> be<00:07:36.819> good<00:07:36.969> to<00:07:37.029> go

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 
percent your server should be good to go

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.219 
percent your server should be good to go
