00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
all right again I have a bead mandrel

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.740 
all right again I have a bead mandrel
with<00:00:03.049> release<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:05.310> toast<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.970> gently<00:00:06.390> in

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
with release and I toast it gently in

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.259 
with release and I toast it gently in
the<00:00:06.990> flame<00:00:09.260> gently<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.620> purpose<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.269> get

the flame gently the purpose is to get

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.810 
the flame gently the purpose is to get
any<00:00:12.450> moisture<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.099> you'll<00:00:14.280> notice<00:00:14.610> too

any moisture out so you'll notice too

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640 
any moisture out so you'll notice too
when<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> dance<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> flame<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.289> kind<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
when I dance in the flame I kind of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.640 
when I dance in the flame I kind of
dance<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.190> an<00:00:17.310> angle<00:00:17.730> down<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.660> not<00:00:18.810> sideways

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
dance at an angle down but not sideways

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.920 
dance at an angle down but not sideways
to<00:00:19.949> me<00:00:20.130> because<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> glass<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.240> flex<00:00:21.660> or

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
to me because the glass if it flex or

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
to me because the glass if it flex or
fractures<00:00:22.800> off<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> kind<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
fractures off it's going to kind of

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.630 
fractures off it's going to kind of
shoot<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.840> cone<00:00:25.130> straight<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.400> what

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
shoot down in a cone straight from what

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
shoot down in a cone straight from what
would<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.289> visualizes<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.320> barrel<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
would be like visualizes the barrel of a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
would be like visualizes the barrel of a
gun<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:30.029> I'm<00:00:30.150> holding<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.960> once<00:00:31.109> you're

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
gun so I'm holding it in and once you're

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
gun so I'm holding it in and once you're
red<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.460> any<00:00:32.640> danger<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
red then you're not in any danger of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.260 
red then you're not in any danger of
thermal<00:00:34.230> shock<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> point

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
thermal shock and now we're at the point

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
thermal shock and now we're at the point
where<00:00:36.450> we're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> start<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> drape<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
where we're going to start to drape the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.790 
where we're going to start to drape the
molten<00:00:38.640> glass<00:00:38.850> onto<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.629> preheated<00:00:40.260> mandrel

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
molten glass onto the preheated mandrel

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.500 
molten glass onto the preheated mandrel
so<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:43.280> I<00:00:44.280> rotate<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> preheated

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so here we go and I rotate the preheated

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
so here we go and I rotate the preheated
mandrel<00:00:46.020> gradually<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:48.950> apply<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.489> molten

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
mandrel gradually as I apply the molten

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.170 
mandrel gradually as I apply the molten
gather<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.260> glass<00:00:52.289> from<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.129> feed<00:00:53.430> cane<00:00:53.760> which

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
gather of glass from my feed cane which

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
gather of glass from my feed cane which
is<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:54.870> hand<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:56.070> notice<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is in my right hand and notice to how I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
is in my right hand and notice to how I
am<00:00:57.390> below<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> flame<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:58.530> respect<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> the

grey is going to gradually return and I
have<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> beautiful<00:01:45.030> simple<00:01:45.570> round<00:01:46.500> bead<00:01:50.390> dance

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
have a beautiful simple round bead dance

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.539 
have a beautiful simple round bead dance
back<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> flame<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.590> reheat<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
back in the flame to reheat it if the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
back in the flame to reheat it if the
bead<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.970> too<00:01:54.210> long<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.899> flame<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
bead is too long out of the flame it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.700 
bead is too long out of the flame it
will<00:01:55.680> crack<00:01:56.719> so<00:01:57.719> periodically<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> want

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
will crack so periodically if you want

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740 
will crack so periodically if you want
to<00:01:58.799> keep<00:01:58.920> working<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> bead<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.090> need<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to keep working on the bead you need to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
to keep working on the bead you need to
flash<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.860> out<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> flame<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
flash it in and out of the flame not so
