fun we're going to be seeing some kind

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.250 
fun we're going to be seeing some kind
of<00:00:24.150> drop<00:00:24.420> here<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.779> not<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
of drop here it's not going to be a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.870 
of drop here it's not going to be a
river<00:00:25.590> drop<00:00:25.769> its<00:00:25.949> most<00:00:26.160> likely<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.789> be

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
river drop its most likely going to be

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.929 
river drop its most likely going to be
some<00:00:27.570> kind<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.960> reach<00:00:28.470> inspires<00:00:29.039> drop<00:00:29.429> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
some kind of reach inspires drop a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.959 
some kind of reach inspires drop a
bulldog<00:00:30.630> drop<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.140> other<00:00:31.260> words<00:00:31.759> named<00:00:32.759> after

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
bulldog drop in other words named after

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.620 
bulldog drop in other words named after
reach<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:34.440> uh<00:00:34.469> reach<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:35.700> huge<00:00:36.149> bucks

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
reach because uh reach has huge bucks

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.400 
reach because uh reach has huge bucks
that<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.790> hence<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that is right and hence if you do it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.799 
that is right and hence if you do it
you're<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> dog<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> reach<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:42.450> made<00:00:42.719> no

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you're a dog of reach I actually made no

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
you're a dog of reach I actually made no
sense<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.590> iiii<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.610> reach<00:00:45.239> would

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
sense at all but iiii think reach would

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
sense at all but iiii think reach would
make<00:00:45.750> sense<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.200> maybe<00:00:47.039> we've<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
make sense of that maybe we've got a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
make sense of that maybe we've got a
river<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.170> Reaver<00:00:49.500> i

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
river actually we do have a Reaver i

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
river actually we do have a Reaver i
just<00:00:49.770> didn't<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.100> robotics<00:00:50.820> support<00:00:51.090> bay

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just didn't see the robotics support bay

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
just didn't see the robotics support bay
but<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.620> river<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> two<00:00:53.489> zealots

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
inside of that shuttle and we'll see if

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
inside of that shuttle and we'll see if
he<00:00:56.730> tries<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> break<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.530> he's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
he tries to go for a break or if he's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.849 
he tries to go for a break or if he's
just<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.719> try<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.750> try<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.680> something

of<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.130> players<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.640> picking<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of these players are now picking up the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.940 
of these players are now picking up the
third<00:01:09.450> basis<00:01:10.070> interesting<00:01:11.070> enough<00:01:11.340> Casey<00:01:11.850> um

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
third basis interesting enough Casey um

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
third basis interesting enough Casey um
choosing<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> pick<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> faraway

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
choosing to pick up kind of a faraway

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
choosing to pick up kind of a faraway
base<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.619> sure<00:01:16.830> how<00:01:17.070> easy<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
base I'm not sure how easy it is the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
base I'm not sure how easy it is the
defense<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.210> mean<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:19.049> incredibly

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
defense I mean it's gonna be incredibly

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.820 
defense I mean it's gonna be incredibly
hard<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> attack<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.500> know<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
hard to attack also so you know it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.870 
hard to attack also so you know it
probably<00:01:23.430> won't<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.759> any<00:01:24.509> problem<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.259> him<00:01:25.380> oh

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
probably won't be any problem for him oh

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.899 
probably won't be any problem for him oh
wow<00:01:26.880> maybe<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.960> shouldn't<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.590> said<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
wow maybe I shouldn't have said that

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.340 
wow maybe I shouldn't have said that
this<00:01:29.909> drop<00:01:30.240> might<00:01:30.509> change<00:01:30.810> things<00:01:30.930> although

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
this drop might change things although

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
this drop might change things although
all<00:01:31.710> nice<00:01:32.070> work<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.369> by<00:01:32.579> Casey<00:01:32.939> killing<00:01:33.509> off

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
all nice work there by Casey killing off

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
all nice work there by Casey killing off
the<00:01:34.650> zealot<00:01:35.100> before<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:35.790> kill<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the zealot before it could kill off the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.990 
the zealot before it could kill off the
tank<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.439> side<00:01:37.710> base<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.520> actually

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
tank so that right side base is actually

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.359 
tank so that right side base is actually
let<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.180> secure<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.799> side<00:01:41.009> base<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
let me secure that right side base of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.910 
let me secure that right side base of
course<00:01:41.520> also<00:01:41.790> connected<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> main<00:01:42.659> base

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
course also connected to the main base

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
course also connected to the main base
like<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.579> does<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.939> sense<00:01:44.970> that's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
like actually it does make sense that's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.730 
like actually it does make sense that's
there<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> guess<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.320> slightly

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
there I guess because it's slightly

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.080 
there I guess because it's slightly
farther<00:01:47.149> away<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.689> terms<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.079> ground<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.850> no

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
farther away in terms of ground but no

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.370 
farther away in terms of ground but no
in<00:01:51.240> terms<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> air<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.140> able<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
in terms of air it's gonna be able to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560 
in terms of air it's gonna be able to
get<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:52.740> well<00:01:53.640> slightly<00:01:54.060> longer<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.509> guess

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
get there well slightly longer I guess

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
get there well slightly longer I guess
also<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.439> still<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.860> able<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> get

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
also but still going to be able to get

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.760 
also but still going to be able to get
to<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.610> side<00:01:56.850> base<00:01:57.380> anyway<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.710> looks

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to that right side base anyway it looks

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
to that right side base anyway it looks
like<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.369> she<00:01:59.549> could<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.850> designed<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.329> for

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
like when she could be designed a go for

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.270 
like when she could be designed a go for
an<00:02:00.540> attack<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> front<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.159> something

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
an attack in the front this is something

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
an attack in the front this is something
Reach<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.670> very<00:02:03.390> good<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.780> finishing<00:02:04.079> off<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
Reach is very good at finishing off the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.810 
actually might be a smart move in fact
we<00:03:30.680> were<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.860> shoot<00:03:31.040> down<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.220> shuttle<00:03:31.700> and

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
we were to shoot down that shuttle and

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.030 
we were to shoot down that shuttle and
just<00:03:32.000> end<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.269> threat<00:03:32.450> for<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> while<00:03:33.040> we'll

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
just end that threat for a while we'll

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.860 
just end that threat for a while we'll
have<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.190> see<00:03:34.280> um<00:03:35.030> oh<00:03:35.209> I'm<00:03:35.360> she<00:03:35.510> designed<00:03:35.780> to

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
have to see um oh I'm she designed to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.520 
have to see um oh I'm she designed to
pick<00:03:35.959> up<00:03:36.049> his<00:03:36.170> fourth<00:03:36.560> base<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.910> is<00:03:38.180> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
pick up his fourth base this is the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.930 
pick up his fourth base this is the
actually<00:03:39.530> his<00:03:39.709> face<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.100> base<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.489> quite

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
actually his face that base is quite

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.640 
actually his face that base is quite
vulnerable<00:03:41.180> surprised<00:03:42.140> he<00:03:42.320> picked<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.560> up

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
vulnerable surprised he picked that up

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.410 
vulnerable surprised he picked that up
because<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.580> right<00:03:43.850> out<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.180> middle<00:03:44.269> of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
because it is right out in the middle of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.300 
because it is right out in the middle of
nowhere<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:44.989> like<00:03:45.320> literally<00:03:45.650> undefended

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
nowhere it's like literally undefended

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.610 
nowhere it's like literally undefended
it's<00:03:46.430> just<00:03:46.580> five<00:03:46.760> min<00:03:46.940> or<00:03:47.030> badges<00:03:47.269> also<00:03:47.720> and

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
it's just five min or badges also and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.470 
it's just five min or badges also and
it's<00:03:48.830> just<00:03:49.519> completely<00:03:49.640> open<00:03:50.209> in<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.390> middle

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
it's just completely open in the middle

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.050 
it's just completely open in the middle
so<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.620> bees<00:03:51.950> could<00:03:52.220> go<00:03:52.370> down<00:03:52.580> very<00:03:52.940> easily

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
so that bees could go down very easily

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.470 
so that bees could go down very easily
if<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:54.560> Greg<00:03:55.430> she<00:03:55.610> loses<00:03:55.880> control<00:03:56.060> over<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
if if Greg she loses control over the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920 
if if Greg she loses control over the
middle<00:03:56.720> here<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:58.670> what<00:03:59.269> I'm<00:03:59.299> surprised<00:03:59.690> by<00:03:59.870> is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
middle here and what I'm surprised by is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.630 
middle here and what I'm surprised by is
at<00:04:00.110> caseys<00:04:00.440> army<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:00.980> small<00:04:01.220> he's<00:04:01.489> been

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
at caseys army is so small he's been

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.990 
at caseys army is so small he's been
mining<00:04:01.910> pretty<00:04:02.630> much<00:04:02.840> I'm<00:04:03.410> he<00:04:03.739> heated<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.820> only

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
mining pretty much I'm he heated it only

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.380 
mining pretty much I'm he heated it only
impeded<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.450> little<00:04:05.690> bit<00:04:05.950> for<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.310> while<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.120> off

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
impeded a little bit for a while and off

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.000 
impeded a little bit for a while and off
of<00:04:08.420> three<00:04:08.750> bases<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.320> you<00:04:09.440> should<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.769> lot

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
of three bases so you should have a lot

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.190 
of three bases so you should have a lot
of<00:04:10.040> vultures<00:04:10.489> but<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.450> far<00:04:11.630> we're<00:04:11.840> not<00:04:11.959> seeing

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
of vultures but so far we're not seeing

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.660 
of vultures but so far we're not seeing
that<00:04:12.380> we're<00:04:12.560> just<00:04:12.709> seeing<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.920> couple<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.310> tanks

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
that we're just seeing a couple of tanks

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.539 
that we're just seeing a couple of tanks
and<00:04:13.760> really<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.450> expect<00:04:15.260> more<00:04:15.500> here<00:04:15.829> from<00:04:16.160> Casey

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
and really I expect more here from Casey

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.180 
and really I expect more here from Casey
um<00:04:17.150> looks<00:04:18.109> like<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.320> Protoss<00:04:18.680> when<00:04:18.919> she<00:04:19.100> has

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
um looks like the Protoss when she has

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.589 
um looks like the Protoss when she has
gotten<00:04:19.430> two<00:04:19.579> shuttles<00:04:20.030> let's<00:04:20.270> see<00:04:20.390> what<00:04:20.539> he

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
gotten two shuttles let's see what he

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.060 
gotten two shuttles let's see what he
does<00:04:20.750> with<00:04:20.959> them<00:04:21.140> is<00:04:21.320> he<00:04:21.620> going<00:04:21.770> to<00:04:21.799> go<00:04:21.890> for<00:04:21.919> the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
does with them is he going to go for the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.190 
does with them is he going to go for the
right<00:04:22.310> side

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
right side

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.890 
right side
try<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.920> land<00:04:24.190> some<00:04:24.430> more<00:04:24.580> worm-like<00:04:24.940> tank

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
try to land some more worm-like tank

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.430 
try to land some more worm-like tank
devices<00:04:26.440> into<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:28.110> expansion<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.230> right

devices into the expansion of the right

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.020 
devices into the expansion of the right
or<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:29.740> he's<00:04:29.890> just<00:04:29.920> going<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.250> hang<00:04:30.670> out<00:04:30.790> for<00:04:31.000> a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
or if he's just going to hang out for a

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.480 
or if he's just going to hang out for a
while<00:04:31.090> I'll<00:04:31.600> have<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.810> see<00:04:32.160> there's<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.250> spider

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
while I'll have to see there's a spider

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.130 
while I'll have to see there's a spider
mind<00:04:33.790> being<00:04:34.060> all<00:04:34.450> there's<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.750> spider<00:04:34.930> mine

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
mind being all there's a spider mine

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.770 
mind being all there's a spider mine
there<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.850> spots<00:04:37.120> things<00:04:37.360> for<00:04:37.660> Casey<00:04:38.320> and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
there the spots things for Casey and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.320 
there the spots things for Casey and
there<00:04:40.780> we<00:04:41.290> are<00:04:41.560> again<00:04:42.130> at<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.550> annoying<00:04:42.940> spot

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
there we are again at that annoying spot

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.770 
there we are again at that annoying spot
behind<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.170> natural<00:04:44.560> expansion<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:46.060> guess

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
behind the natural expansion I guess

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.120 
behind the natural expansion I guess
this<00:04:46.930> would<00:04:47.110> be<00:04:47.230> when<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.440> naturals<00:04:47.800> actually

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
this would be when the naturals actually

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.210 
this would be when the naturals actually
it<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.310> natural<00:04:48.730> anyway<00:04:49.720> oh<00:04:49.930> nice<00:04:50.590> push<00:04:50.980> out

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
it is natural anyway oh nice push out

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.640 
it is natural anyway oh nice push out
here<00:04:51.490> from<00:04:51.850> Casey<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.450> gotta<00:04:52.690> say<00:04:52.930> now<00:04:53.140> he's

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
here from Casey I gotta say now he's

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.740 
here from Casey I gotta say now he's
finally<00:04:53.860> getting<00:04:54.730> a<00:04:54.940> bit<00:04:55.060> aggressive<00:04:55.540> he's

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
finally getting a bit aggressive he's

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.910 
finally getting a bit aggressive he's
planted<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.200> couple<00:04:56.500> mines<00:04:56.770> nice<00:04:57.550> work<00:04:57.790> and

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
planted a couple mines nice work and

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
planted a couple mines nice work and
managed<00:04:59.920> to<00:05:00.010> cut<00:05:00.160> off<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.340> couple<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.670> dragoons

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
managed to cut off a couple of dragoons

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.940 
managed to cut off a couple of dragoons
there<00:05:01.180> without<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.660> cost<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.260> without<00:05:02.830> the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
there without the cost of without the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.800 
there without the cost of without the
loss<00:05:03.100> of<00:05:03.250> any<00:05:03.400> tanks<00:05:03.790> but<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.270> really<00:05:04.630> feel<00:05:04.780> like

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
loss of any tanks but I really feel like

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.440 
loss of any tanks but I really feel like
Casey<00:05:05.590> could<00:05:05.860> be<00:05:05.920> doing<00:05:06.100> a<00:05:06.160> better<00:05:06.450> production

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
Casey could be doing a better production

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.020 
Casey could be doing a better production
job<00:05:07.810> here<00:05:08.080> than<00:05:08.530> he<00:05:08.650> has<00:05:08.770> been<00:05:09.030> interesting

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
job here than he has been interesting

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.550 
job here than he has been interesting
he's<00:05:10.180> taking<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.540> middle<00:05:10.750> expansion<00:05:11.200> to<00:05:11.320> now

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
he's taking the middle expansion to now

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.230 
he's taking the middle expansion to now
both<00:05:11.740> players<00:05:12.010> have<00:05:12.070> taken<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.520> middle<00:05:12.730> so

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
both players have taken the middle so

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.280 
both players have taken the middle so
basically<00:05:13.600> they're<00:05:13.750> gonna<00:05:13.840> have<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.020> rely<00:05:14.260> on

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
basically they're gonna have to rely on

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.140 
basically they're gonna have to rely on
being<00:05:14.530> able<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:14.740> hold<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.520> center<00:05:15.730> where<00:05:16.030> else

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
being able to hold the center where else

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.090 
being able to hold the center where else
they're<00:05:16.360> gonna<00:05:16.420> lose<00:05:16.630> these<00:05:16.840> bases<00:05:17.200> but<00:05:18.040> I

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
they're gonna lose these bases but I

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.560 
they're gonna lose these bases but I
guess<00:05:18.130> he<00:05:18.310> figures<00:05:18.850> he's<00:05:19.030> gonna<00:05:19.120> reinforce

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
guess he figures he's gonna reinforce

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.170 
guess he figures he's gonna reinforce
along<00:05:20.170> this<00:05:20.350> line<00:05:20.590> anyway<00:05:21.130> that's<00:05:21.880> why<00:05:22.060> he's

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
along this line anyway that's why he's

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.180 
along this line anyway that's why he's
not<00:05:22.330> taking<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.720> farther<00:05:23.230> away<00:05:23.260> bases<00:05:23.890> but<00:05:24.010> oh

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
not taking the farther away bases but oh

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.160 
not taking the farther away bases but oh
look<00:05:24.400> at<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.580> casey<00:05:24.940> i<00:05:25.270> think<00:05:25.720> knows<00:05:25.930> about

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
look at this casey i think knows about

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.750 
look at this casey i think knows about
this<00:05:26.320> base<00:05:26.530> nope<00:05:26.860> he<00:05:27.160> just<00:05:27.190> curbing<00:05:27.730> North

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
this base nope he just curbing North

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.360 
this base nope he just curbing North
okay<00:05:28.300> so<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:29.230> guess<00:05:29.440> he<00:05:29.560> doesn't<00:05:29.800> he<00:05:30.130> was<00:05:30.220> just

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
okay so I guess he doesn't he was just

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.010 
okay so I guess he doesn't he was just
curving<00:05:30.550> north<00:05:30.790> trying<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.090> get<00:05:31.180> around<00:05:31.480> oh<00:05:31.720> he

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
curving north trying to get around oh he

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.080 
curving north trying to get around oh he
gets<00:05:32.200> around<00:05:32.530> nice<00:05:32.920> work<00:05:33.160> there<00:05:33.190> by<00:05:33.400> Casey<00:05:33.730> but

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
gets around nice work there by Casey but

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.360 
gets around nice work there by Casey but
smartly<00:05:34.840> enough<00:05:35.080> Gwen<00:05:35.320> she<00:05:35.680> has<00:05:35.920> built<00:05:36.190> some

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
smartly enough Gwen she has built some

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.020 
smartly enough Gwen she has built some

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
little damage but I really don't think

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:41.739 
little damage but I really don't think
it'll<00:06:39.589> be<00:06:39.649> enough<00:06:40.309> to<00:06:40.729> to<00:06:41.179> make<00:06:41.330> him<00:06:41.509> win<00:06:41.659> the

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.829 
often you know need to be able to do
something<00:06:51.229> for<00:06:51.830> the<00:06:51.889> time<00:06:52.270> and<00:06:53.270> I<00:06:53.360> think<00:06:53.719> it's

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:53.839 
something for the time and I think it's

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.029 
something for the time and I think it's
served<00:06:54.020> its<00:06:54.110> purpose<00:06:54.199> there<00:06:54.619> but<00:06:54.800> I<00:06:54.830> don't

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
served its purpose there but I don't

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.350 
served its purpose there but I don't
think<00:06:55.129> it's<00:06:55.309> been<00:06:55.429> you<00:06:55.729> know<00:06:55.819> lethal<00:06:56.240> damage

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
think it's been you know lethal damage

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.260 
think it's been you know lethal damage
by<00:06:56.719> any<00:06:56.869> means<00:06:57.080> and<00:06:57.729> so<00:06:58.729> basically<00:06:58.849> both

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
by any means and so basically both

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.659 
by any means and so basically both
players<00:06:59.509> I'd<00:06:59.659> say<00:06:59.809> are<00:06:59.899> about<00:07:00.050> even<00:07:00.289> um<00:07:01.279> Casey

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
players I'd say are about even um Casey

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.689 
players I'd say are about even um Casey
on<00:07:02.029> their<00:07:02.179> hand<00:07:02.949> has<00:07:03.949> not<00:07:04.189> been<00:07:04.339> able<00:07:04.399> to<00:07:04.580> any

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
on their hand has not been able to any

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.029 
on their hand has not been able to any
harassment<00:07:04.939> but<00:07:05.419> he<00:07:05.539> is<00:07:05.659> turn<00:07:05.929> so<00:07:06.289> he<00:07:06.860> can<00:07:06.949> get

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 
harassment but he is turn so he can get

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.949 
harassment but he is turn so he can get
away<00:07:07.129> with<00:07:07.219> that<00:07:07.429> a<00:07:07.610> little<00:07:07.879> bit<00:07:07.939> more<00:07:08.179> are<00:07:08.629> now

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:08.959 
away with that a little bit more are now

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.209 
away with that a little bit more are now
he's<00:07:09.139> gonna<00:07:09.289> be<00:07:09.379> trying<00:07:09.619> to<00:07:09.769> but<00:07:09.949> I<00:07:09.979> don't

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:10.219 
he's gonna be trying to but I don't

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:11.350 
he's gonna be trying to but I don't
think<00:07:10.309> this<00:07:10.429> is<00:07:10.490> gonna<00:07:10.639> last<00:07:10.789> long<00:07:11.059> let's<00:07:11.269> see

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
think this is gonna last long let's see

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.059 
think this is gonna last long let's see
how<00:07:11.419> good<00:07:11.479> as<00:07:11.659> vulture<00:07:11.959> micro<00:07:12.289> is<00:07:12.469> if<00:07:12.919> he's

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069 
how good as vulture micro is if he's

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.699 
how good as vulture micro is if he's
gonna<00:07:13.219> target<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:14.029> probes<00:07:14.479> he<00:07:14.719> is<00:07:14.839> letting

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:15.709 
gonna target the probes he is letting

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:18.850 
gonna target the probes he is letting
them<00:07:15.889> take<00:07:16.159> some<00:07:16.339> hits<00:07:16.459> um<00:07:16.959> looks<00:07:17.959> like<00:07:18.139> Remy

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
them take some hits um looks like Remy

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.019 
them take some hits um looks like Remy
she<00:07:19.009> might<00:07:19.279> be<00:07:19.399> think<00:07:19.550> about<00:07:19.610> picking<00:07:19.909> up<00:07:19.939> a

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:20.029 
she might be think about picking up a

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.939 
she might be think about picking up a
fifth<00:07:20.269> base<00:07:20.449> but<00:07:20.809> he<00:07:20.839> isn't<00:07:21.349> get<00:07:21.469> spotted<00:07:21.830> and

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
fifth base but he isn't get spotted and

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.409 
fifth base but he isn't get spotted and
so<00:07:24.949> far<00:07:25.189> I<00:07:25.219> mean<00:07:25.309> basically<00:07:25.580> both<00:07:25.909> players<00:07:26.240> are

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 
so far I mean basically both players are

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:27.759 
so far I mean basically both players are
just<00:07:26.569> jockeying<00:07:26.959> for<00:07:27.019> position<00:07:27.439> of<00:07:27.529> amazed

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:27.769 
just jockeying for position of amazed

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:29.379 
just jockeying for position of amazed
that<00:07:27.800> they<00:07:28.069> haven't<00:07:28.490> had<00:07:28.699> an<00:07:28.789> encounter<00:07:29.059> yet

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
that they haven't had an encounter yet

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.939 
that they haven't had an encounter yet
well<00:07:29.899> I<00:07:29.959> guess<00:07:30.110> it's<00:07:30.259> because<00:07:30.379> Casey<00:07:30.709> doesn't

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:30.949 
well I guess it's because Casey doesn't

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:32.679 
well I guess it's because Casey doesn't
want<00:07:31.159> to<00:07:31.219> move<00:07:31.279> out<00:07:31.459> and<00:07:31.759> that<00:07:32.300> Graham<00:07:32.479> she

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:32.689 
want to move out and that Graham she

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:34.449 
want to move out and that Graham she
doesn't<00:07:33.080> want<00:07:33.199> to<00:07:33.259> move<00:07:33.349> in<00:07:33.529> so<00:07:33.679> you<00:07:34.129> know<00:07:34.249> make

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:34.459 
doesn't want to move in so you know make

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:36.669 
doesn't want to move in so you know make
sense
