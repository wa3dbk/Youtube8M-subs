well<00:00:16.539> hopefully<00:00:17.140> you<00:00:17.289> can<00:00:17.410> tell<00:00:17.680> from<00:00:17.860> looking

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
well hopefully you can tell from looking

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.810 
well hopefully you can tell from looking
at<00:00:18.340> this<00:00:18.550> this<00:00:19.539> mechanism<00:00:19.960> right<00:00:20.410> here<00:00:20.610> is<00:00:21.610> the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
at this this mechanism right here is the

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.100 
at this this mechanism right here is the
one<00:00:22.000> that<00:00:22.150> fits<00:00:22.420> up<00:00:22.660> into<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.260> visor

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
one that fits up into the visor

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.300 
one that fits up into the visor
headliner<00:00:26.110> of<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:26.380> car<00:00:26.619> I'm<00:00:26.860> sorry

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
headliner of the car I'm sorry

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.570 
headliner of the car I'm sorry
and<00:00:27.580> then<00:00:28.110> this<00:00:29.110> automatically<00:00:29.770> slides<00:00:30.250> into

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
and then this automatically slides into

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.170 
and then this automatically slides into
the<00:00:30.939> old<00:00:31.869> visor<00:00:32.280> but<00:00:33.280> whenever<00:00:33.489> this<00:00:33.760> mounts

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
the old visor but whenever this mounts

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.119 
the old visor but whenever this mounts
up<00:00:34.330> into<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.809> headliner<00:00:35.199> this<00:00:35.559> is<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.830> part

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
up into the headliner this is the part

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.189 
up into the headliner this is the part
that<00:00:36.190> I'm<00:00:36.370> talking<00:00:36.760> about<00:00:36.940> in<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.390> article

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
that I'm talking about in the article

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.509 
that I'm talking about in the article
where<00:00:39.070> you've<00:00:39.670> got<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:40.000> take<00:00:40.210> this<00:00:40.420> apart<00:00:41.519> that

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
where you've got to take this apart that

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.570 
where you've got to take this apart that
comes<00:00:42.850> off<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:44.080> pops<00:00:44.500> into<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.100> headliner

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
comes off this pops into the headliner

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.720 
comes off this pops into the headliner
right<00:00:45.910> here<00:00:46.210> so<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.140> just<00:00:47.170> snaps<00:00:48.100> right<00:00:48.280> into

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
right here so it just snaps right into

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.389 
right here so it just snaps right into
the<00:00:48.850> headliner<00:00:49.300> with<00:00:49.540> these<00:00:49.719> clips<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:51.129> once

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
the headliner with these clips then once

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.340 
the headliner with these clips then once
you<00:00:51.579> get<00:00:51.820> these<00:00:52.059> into<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.600> headliner<00:00:53.079> with

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
you get these into the headliner with

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.190 
you get these into the headliner with
your<00:00:53.500> clips<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.640> take<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.149> retainer<00:00:55.750> part

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
your clips you take the retainer part

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400 
your clips you take the retainer part
and<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.530> part<00:00:57.430> snaps<00:00:58.270> right<00:00:59.050> over<00:00:59.289> the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
and that part snaps right over the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.250 
and that part snaps right over the
outside<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.890> it<00:01:00.219> so<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.090> hope<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.449> explains<00:01:02.050> it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
outside of it so I hope that explains it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.480 
outside of it so I hope that explains it
a<00:01:02.350> little<00:01:02.530> bit<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.550> pulled<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:05.490> material

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
a little bit and I pulled the material

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.150 
a little bit and I pulled the material
back<00:01:06.759> off<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.570> visor<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:08.890> can

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
back off of the visor just so you can

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.930 
back off of the visor just so you can
see<00:01:09.720> how<00:01:10.720> cheap<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.380> visor<00:01:11.649> is<00:01:12.130> or<00:01:12.490> how<00:01:12.610> cheap

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
see how cheap the visor is or how cheap

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.480 
see how cheap the visor is or how cheap
it<00:01:13.149> was<00:01:13.200> manufactured<00:01:14.200> because<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:15.220> part

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
it was manufactured because this part

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.240 
it was manufactured because this part
right<00:01:15.670> here<00:01:16.200> rotates<00:01:17.200> inside<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
right here rotates inside of that and it

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.550 
right here rotates inside of that and it
pops<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:22.000> between<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:22.959> I'm<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:23.319> very

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
pops in between that so I'm it's very

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.199 
pops in between that so I'm it's very
poor<00:01:23.950> engineering<00:01:24.700> but<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.520> about<00:01:27.849> the<00:01:28.060> way

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
poor engineering but it's about the way

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.380 
poor engineering but it's about the way
that<00:01:28.509> Toyota<00:01:29.470> built<00:01:29.830> it<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.250> so<00:01:30.580> you<00:01:31.270> know

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
that Toyota built it and so you know

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.779 
that Toyota built it and so you know
whenever<00:01:31.569> you<00:01:31.840> replace<00:01:32.020> these<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:33.310> just<00:01:33.670> have

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
whenever you replace these you just have

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.930 
whenever you replace these you just have
to<00:01:33.910> go<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.209> there<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.250> pull<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.459> cover<00:01:36.789> off

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
to go in there and pull this cover off

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.080 
to go in there and pull this cover off
of<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.259> main<00:01:38.470> part<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.190> that's<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
of the main part of it that's in the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.809 
of the main part of it that's in the
headliner<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.810> then<00:01:41.470> this<00:01:41.830> part<00:01:42.160> just<00:01:42.399> pops

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
headliner and then this part just pops

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:44.940 
headliner and then this part just pops
out<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.660> headliner<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.349> I'll<00:01:44.560> show<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.830> a

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
out of the headliner and I'll show you a

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.830 
out of the headliner and I'll show you a
picture<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.489> headliner<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.179> another<00:01:46.539> rub

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
picture of the headliner in another rub

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.719 
picture of the headliner in another rub
and<00:01:47.140> another<00:01:47.470> view<00:01:47.800> here<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.099> just<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.399> moment

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
and another view here in just a moment

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.999 
and another view here in just a moment
so<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.720> hope<00:01:49.959> that<00:01:50.170> helps<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.649> know<00:01:50.709> it's<00:01:50.950> a

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
so I hope that helps I know it's a

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.430 
so I hope that helps I know it's a
little<00:01:51.190> confusing<00:01:51.569> but<00:01:52.569> they<00:01:52.750> charge<00:01:52.959> 60

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
little confusing but they charge 60

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.109 
little confusing but they charge 60
dollars<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.890> replace<00:01:54.160> this<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.729> it's<00:01:54.880> really

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
dollars to replace this and it's really

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.510 
dollars to replace this and it's really
not<00:01:55.300> necessary<00:01:55.929> it's<00:01:56.739> a<00:01:57.039> five<00:01:57.489> minute

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
not necessary it's a five minute

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.869 
not necessary it's a five minute
replacement<00:01:58.119> at<00:01:58.569> best
