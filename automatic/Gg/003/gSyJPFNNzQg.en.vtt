verse<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.760> clones<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:01.900> this<00:02:02.470> evens<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.100> out<00:02:03.160> a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
verse the clones so this evens it out a

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.260 
verse the clones so this evens it out a
little<00:02:03.400> bit<00:02:03.810> hopefully<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:06.460> both<00:02:06.610> both

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
little bit hopefully and they both both

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.109 
little bit hopefully and they both both
teams<00:02:07.510> have<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.870> set<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.520> unmovable<00:02:09.520> barriers<00:02:09.910> i

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
teams have a set of unmovable barriers i

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.190 
teams have a set of unmovable barriers i
gave<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> clones<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.750> little<00:02:10.899> bit<00:02:11.020> more

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
gave the clones a little bit more

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.830 
gave the clones a little bit more
because<00:02:11.440> these<00:02:12.280> assault<00:02:12.700> rifles<00:02:13.150> really<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.810> a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
because these assault rifles really do a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.040 
because these assault rifles really do a
lot<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.050> damage<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.600> i'm<00:02:16.600> going<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> start<00:02:16.870> to
