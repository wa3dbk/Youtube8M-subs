00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello scum were these 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.430
 breaking italy the show that goes on the air 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.269
 from Monday to Friday in which we speak 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.269
 of what happens in the world 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.340
 this morning while I was having breakfast at 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
 take a look at the tweets, take the comments 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.760
 I read the e-mails you sent me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 I found a definitely noteworthy one 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 number of articles linked to me in this regard 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 to Greece the same articles I have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.680
 found in large numbers on mine 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.270
 facebook timeline posted by mine 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.100
 same friends so let's talk for a moment 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 of greece you regulate scum that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
 to talk about something is a lot 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 important to read up about but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 documenting merit does not mean 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.250
 read a random thing written by that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.650
 both it is necessary that there are some 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.570
 authoritative minimum mushrooms to have a 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.190
 minimum security that things that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.650
 they are said not to be excessively 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 factious or overly modified for 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.090
 create an impact or another with respect to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.530
 who reads and is one of the reasons for i 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.239
 which under all the breaking videos 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.470
 you find the sources to things that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 I say so that you can go 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.949
 directly you to see who says 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 something if the environment the performance 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 correct if yours is different than 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 I say this because I am going to mention the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.850
 the guardian's british newspaper 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.259
 but not just the guardian launched 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 the alarm a few days ago about 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.039
 a real humanitarian ridge that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.049
 Greece would be taking place in Greece 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.939
 as you know it has been crossed e 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.740
 still experiencing a major crisis 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.240
 financial that is going through good 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 part of Europe but that has hit more 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.509
 harshly greece currently in fact 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.429
 greece is the scarecrow not only from 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.439
 Italian politician on duty but of all 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.090
 European politicians all the politicians are 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.069
 saying things like we shouldn't do 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.929
 this to not end up like Greece not 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.639
 we have to do that to not be like 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.409
 Greece and this being like Greece 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.209
 let us know the guardian is one 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.609
 decidedly unenviable situation i 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.889
 2011 data show that 31 per 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.229
 one hundred of the population lives below 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:52.049
 60 percent of what is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.429
 average wages in Greece 15 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 the important disparity between those who have too much 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.810
 and those who have too little especially also 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.609
 Whereas Greece to struggle 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.259
 between meadows economy a lot of 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.759
 small businesses close and the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.520
 unemployment is rampant but in addition to being 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.229
 rampant unemployment 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.060
 and also despair tended to 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.830
 they are always more and more data 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.110
 of 2011 the people who turn to 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.090
 canteens of things like caritas co la 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.980
 church is spoken of 40 thousand homeless 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.349
 people who live on the street and who to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.269
 European standards are a large number were 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.340
 a real humanitarian crisis is 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.780
 important to continue to inquire into 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.739
 about Greece continues to be 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.330
 be careful first of all because it is 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.340
 important regardless of secondarily 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.750
 because greece is nearby is part 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.540
 of the European community of which we are 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.280
 all part but to get good information 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.950
 scum is also important to inquire 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.540
 in the right places the internet boom is 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.319
 seeing a sack starring the bad 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.970
 information 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.190
 I call it bad information only 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.750
 for fair play when you see articles on 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.329
 semi-unknown blogs with strange names 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.640
 type continuous struggle against the media that 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.110
 it oppresses us or things like that you are 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.180
 a little suspicious before hugging 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.040
 blindly what these media give you 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.110
 say 1 check the sources also i 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.640
 bloggers should publish the sources 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.560
 of the things the two states write 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.540
 beware that these media do not take the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.340
 news and modifying it by extrapolating them 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.989
 from the context or by magnifying this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.090
 context out of proportion to create 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.700
 apocalyptic scenarios like invasion of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.290
 zombie 28 days later mad max than for 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.720
 make it credible they all hook 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.700
 always the usual good old green 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.859
 green the media hide the truth 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.930
 facebook is full of pages so internet 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.549
 is full of block is the reason for the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.290
 which this happens and which is easier 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.389
 make headlines make views in 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.340
 this way that tell you things like 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.810
 I'm doing the 5 from right now 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.430
 placito of you will have already closed the video 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.569
 I'm at the point then to reward those 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.060
 that we stayed we raise the level 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.730
 cultural here is a person who plays 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.730
 of particular percussion in such a way 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.730
 particular 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.730
 speaking of lighter things and being asked 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.920
 patenting would be working on a 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.989
 prototype clock that is called 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.579
 iwatch today all the newspapers talk about 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.379
 this thing to the specialized ones e 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.260
 those not because it's a fantastic thing 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.720
 a watch that is practically an iphone 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.549
 tiny or a tiny ipod that 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.489
 the best object to always show at 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.680
 wrist to say hey people robbed mico 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.930
 400 euros supported just that on 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.519
 easy wrist take me this work yes 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.799
 hypothesizes it will be a sort of deputy from 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.510
 use together with other apple devices 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.039
 therefore it will be possible to check over 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.810
 wait a lot of other things 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.990
 in this tiny le type screen 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.850
 SMS notifications on facebook 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.590
 also it will be great to be still 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.210
 more associates so instead of making 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.070
 assholes with their friends and talk with 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.270
 them while looking at other things yes 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.830
 register and messages you look at cats v 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.539
 it will be possible to do this by looking at the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.789
 really place i am a 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.530
 big fan of apple though this thing not 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.479
 particularly excites me though 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.880
 analysts do not know who these are 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.800
 analysts believe that in ten years 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.229
 maximum an object like this could 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.630
 to supplant modern smartphones after and 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.280
 if I can not say that bc place is not me 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.440
 they concern these things where mine are 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.240
 project plus not seriously google where 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.860
 they are the project plus and then we talk about 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.099
 crozza because now everyone is 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.870
 complaining about the festival yesterday oh my god 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.490
 I frankly celebrate the festival yesterday 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.440
 evening I was not watching the festival of 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.750
 sanremo I was living my life at 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.520
 maximum indeed I was in bed pajamas that 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.470
 I watched old episodes of the south park 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.570
 this is what interests me but 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.889
 I have been inundated with SMS notifications on 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.270
 skype that told me he was 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.680
 happening a mess in the moment in the 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.030
 which one started imitating it 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.620
 berlusconi so I immediately 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.300
 catapulted to see the thing e 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.620
 this morning or seen the replay of 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.510
 what I had already seen yesterday on 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.340
 youtube the usual stoned knows yes 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.810
 they are made to scream out not yes 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.150
 he speaks of politics in fact one is never 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.979
 talked about politics on sanremo unless 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.780
 that we do not count all the other sanremo 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.280
 the same last year in celentano is 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.870
 the same thing happened, he started 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.889
 talk about politics the usual mythomaniac 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.400
 he started yelling he was thrown 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.990
 out 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.000
 and the problem went very well is that 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.860
 crozza did not recover nasally 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.510
 it was then seen throughout the rest 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.220
 of the intervention that was not taking place 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.620
 obviously amusing as usual 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.270
 has fun while among his gags and also 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.620
 if from katie races due to the fact that he has 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.720
 recycled of the old quarrels from the 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.790
 scrimo staimo sanremo invented of the 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.350
 new jokes sanremo always works 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.420
 so it's one of the reasons why I don't 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.520
 I look at Sanremo is this claim of par 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.560
 I condemn the par condicio 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.540
 because par condicio in italy means 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.820
 if you speak ill of one you must speak ill 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.620
 of all in no no I speak ill of 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.390
 someone when this someone does 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.790
 something I don't like because in 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.710
 Italy applies this thing of the fact that if 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.020
 everyone steals if they say that everyone steals 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.880
 then nobody but if everyone is wrong 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.160
 no one is wrong and it also happens under i 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.660
 my videos every time I say 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.010
 berlusconi or I say the left 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.880
 immediately there is someone who is 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.800
 offends even if it's one thing 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.180
 mainly the prerogative of the pdl 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.950
 this of being offended when it comes to 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.900
 berlusconi or touch that world e 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.910
 then the left because they are all 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.950
 thieves and therefore nobody is a thief and therefore 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.530
 and this is the par condicio in italy 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.210
 because we are so adults as adults 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.650
 though thinking about it is great that me 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.780
