00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.170
 this is the last one I did with 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.170
 report that happened 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.949
 with the same press 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.949
 finally even family 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.529
 contrast with 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.529
 wisdom 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.569
 opposition 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.399
 for several years 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.339
 if all the pairs warm colors 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.339
 finally in the past 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 time is looking 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 some activities remain 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130
 it's more than in November 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.220
 the whole question 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.210
 m another team 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 more careful you are you have a love affair with seeing her 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.840
 since the crisis 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.010
 I would like you to tell me his closest friends the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.509
 weather is partly by the weekly barron's 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.740
 we already have a lot of goals 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.750
 that's why I say it's a kind 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.450
 actually from this sect 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.810
 trilogy returns the walker 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.570
 the the receiver 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.690
 a new decree the driver it's a nice dollar metaphor 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.100
 all 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.520
 if you want it's a metaphor that is no longer relevant 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.760
 that the digital that's what you mean that throughout your 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.880
 listing 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 this digital that I will not summarize myself m 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.530
 this season 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.270
 demands 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.250
 it's not my article it's your your creed today so I learned to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.560
 a woman 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.639
 he has an end and a few points but what do you want to do 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.090
 what I mean that this machine somehow 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.490
 finish the loop 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.020
 this loop the road 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 armed with his unfortunate 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.360
 everything I read 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.040
