00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.639
 Hi there, this is a mechanic type project and 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.080
 with you today bboy is right to command 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.910
 master today on the video lesson we 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.610
 Consider such an element of breaking as 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.500
 match mills or barrel but at the beginning of our 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.180
 a lesson let me congratulate all Russians 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.130
 Happy Victory Day 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.830
 great patriotic war dear 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.990
 veterans wish health happiness on 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.519
 many long years with the holiday 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.210
 dear veterans on a holiday 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 dear Russians 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.360
 so to learn how to do 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.200
 an element like a barrel needs to be learned 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.720
 Three basic rules Three main stages 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.830
 so the first barrel needs to be taught how 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.540
 separate element 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.160
 the most worthy recipe is that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.560
 many begin to teach him to do right away 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.510
 through helico trying to reduce the legs it 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.430
 wrong completely different items 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 completely different laws and since 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.590
 to enter the game correctly, melas 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.790
 show goes with us 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.229
 classical arrangement of legs in width 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.530
 shoulders means moving your left foot back to 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.140
 her place as tired right hand right 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 arm and at this moment the left leg is not 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 just flies ahead and taps 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.330
 wiring and fastened immediately with her then 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.430
 going back down 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.259
 over my shoulder I already substitute my left 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.460
 hand right over his shoulder looks like this 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:42.350
 foot went hand and descent down again 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.280
 leg is inserted back put right 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.090
 arm left foot clings right and there 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.090
 come in skin 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.550
 the second stage in order to proceed to 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.200
 the second stage again remember our 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.800
 video tutorials about backspin 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.590
 and probing mil pay attention here on 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.990
 this part of the island wall as we go in 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.970
 back we have to spin around 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.380
 as soon as you learn to spin on 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.899
 back after that you can continue 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.740
 further but the first thing to learn 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.840
 after calling 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.950
 this spin on the back and so now 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280
 combine the first stage 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.660
 and the second set back and rotations 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.370
 we set aside the leg we expose the hand 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.370
 hook and twist on the feet 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.000
 exactly so the third rule for that 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.580
 to learn how to make a barrel in that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.700
 the moment we are on the back here 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.670
 go on back here we rotate legs 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.950
 we are connected by a cross all 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.230
 they are not torn anywhere there is the most 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.090
 the main hands in the ring remember again 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.070
 a lesson with with bella to his 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.470
 things go by swing hands in the ring 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.830
 substitutes supplied forehead goes emphasis 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.570
 on him and return again on his back 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.320
 so it turns out that the following 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.709
 point of support 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.860
 after the back is just got hands 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.600
 function only maha magic 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.600
 becomes like a ring in front of you 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.580
 this is rotation 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:19.820
 it turns out we go down we rotate on 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.750
 back and swing your arms and the most important 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.490
 moment barrels this push legs feet 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.430
 when you are on your back along with 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.920
 smack of hands do not need to push up 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.560
 what worked like this is not necessary 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.960
 knock into the floor you need to push off 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.220
 we return ourselves back as a job exactly 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.610
 or work beater 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.890
 you to yourself from yourself to yourself that moment 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.490
 when there is a push with the legs in the same 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.260
 the moment you tuck yourself 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.990
 exactly when the complex is done 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.910
 correct correct entry correctly and 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.820
 rotation control on the back is correct 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.110
 push with your feet and swing your arms while doing so 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.760
 when does the barrel turn out 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.500
 as soon as you start waving 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.390
 wrong either with your hands 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.250
 either pushing wrong legs 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.580
 getting roofs going ie you 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.230
 develop only worth straighten legs 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.260
 or give up and go there with hands 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.530
 for example, it turns out so wrong masses 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.530
 leg 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.540
 wrong swing hands too roofs only 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.020
 right swing feet and right 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:43.250
 hands leads you to what is your match 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:44.960
 perfect beautiful energy and so with you 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.360
 today was bboy right to command 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.400
 masters today as part of a project lesson 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.979
 hip hop mechanics we studied such 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.020
 item like match myth or barrel watch 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.490
