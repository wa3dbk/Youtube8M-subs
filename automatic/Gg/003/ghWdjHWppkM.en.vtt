show<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.510> how<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> tweeze<00:00:10.440> them<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.889> how<00:00:11.309> I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
show you how I tweeze them and how I

show you how I tweeze them and how I
fold<00:00:11.610> them<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.300> video<00:00:12.750> might<00:00:13.080> get<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> bit

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
fold them in this video might get a bit

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.890 
fold them in this video might get a bit
long<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> might<00:00:14.580> separate<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.299> into<00:00:15.509> two

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
long so I might separate it into two

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.430 
long so I might separate it into two
parts

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
parts

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.250 
parts
we'll<00:00:16.859> see<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> day<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> day<00:00:18.539> basis<00:00:19.109> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
we'll see so on a day to day basis I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.710 
we'll see so on a day to day basis I
tend<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> keep<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:20.100> eyebrows<00:00:20.490> quite<00:00:20.880> natural<00:00:21.539> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
tend to keep my eyebrows quite natural I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990 
tend to keep my eyebrows quite natural I
quite<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> natural<00:00:22.769> look<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:23.730> that's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
quite like the natural look so if that's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.460 
quite like the natural look so if that's
what<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> want

my<00:00:29.490> eyebrows<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.480> tweeze<00:00:30.720> them<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.140> use

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
my eyebrows I just tweeze them I use

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.150 
my eyebrows I just tweeze them I use
this<00:00:31.560> tweezer<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.820> ELF<00:00:33.380> it's<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.530> great<00:00:34.829> but

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this tweezer from ELF it's not great but

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400 
this tweezer from ELF it's not great but
it's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.460> terrible<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.719> definitely

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it's not terrible if you can definitely

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
it's not terrible if you can definitely
invest<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.070> pleaser<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.910> tweezer

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
invest in a good pleaser like my tweezer

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
invest in a good pleaser like my tweezer
man<00:00:39.510> or<00:00:39.660> something<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:41.010> are

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
man or something because they really are

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
man or something because they really are
good<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.480> job<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
good and they really do a good job I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.729 
good and they really do a good job I
usually<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.920> start<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:45.079> looking<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
usually just start by looking at this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.080 
usually just start by looking at this
line<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.110> seeing<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.620> hairs<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:51.030> I

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
line here and seeing what hairs do I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.229 
line here and seeing what hairs do I
have<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.050> below<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> rest<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
have that are like below the rest of the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:05.300 
have that are like below the rest of the
hairs<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.719> guess<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.280> start<00:00:56.940> there

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.310 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.160 

the<00:01:06.310> trick<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.760> think<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.120> just<00:01:07.480> do<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.780> one

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
the trick I think is to just do it one

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.920 
the trick I think is to just do it one
by<00:01:08.350> one<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:09.370> do<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.820> carefully<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.600> slowly

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
by one just do it carefully and slowly

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.320 
by one just do it carefully and slowly
so<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.620> you<00:01:11.740> don't<00:01:11.920> over<00:01:12.670> pluck<00:01:12.940> because

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
so that you don't over pluck because

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.560 
so that you don't over pluck because
trust<00:01:14.200> me<00:01:14.290> I've<00:01:14.650> over<00:01:15.100> plucked<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.670> lot<00:01:16.240> and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
trust me I've over plucked a lot and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:29.070 
trust me I've over plucked a lot and
it's<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> good<00:01:17.560> thing<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> once<00:01:28.690> I'm<00:01:28.870> happy

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
it's not a good thing so once I'm happy

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's not a good thing so once I'm happy
with<00:01:29.290> how<00:01:29.680> straight<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.550> line<00:01:30.970> looks<00:01:31.360> I<00:01:31.720> then

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
with how straight that line looks I then

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.130 
with how straight that line looks I then
move<00:01:32.800> on<00:01:32.980> to<00:01:33.130> my<00:01:33.310> arch<00:01:33.580> just<00:01:34.030> here<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.510> I'm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
move on to my arch just here and I'm

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.490 
move on to my arch just here and I'm
very<00:01:35.380> careful<00:01:35.650> about<00:01:35.920> doing<00:01:36.640> my<00:01:36.760> arch<00:01:37.030> because

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
very careful about doing my arch because

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.320 
very careful about doing my arch because
it's<00:01:38.500> quite<00:01:38.800> thin<00:01:39.160> already<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.030> really

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
it's quite thin already and I really

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.910 
it's quite thin already and I really
don't<00:01:40.479> want<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.630> make<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.930> thinner<00:01:41.200> but<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.800> do

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
don't want to make it thinner but I do

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.650 
don't want to make it thinner but I do
want<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.220> keep<00:01:42.400> it<00:01:42.550> quite<00:01:42.790> high<00:01:43.030> because<00:01:43.479> my

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
want to keep it quite high because my

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.350 
want to keep it quite high because my
eyebrows<00:01:44.260> naturally<00:01:45.010> have<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.550> tendency<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.120> be

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
eyebrows naturally have a tendency to be

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.180 
eyebrows naturally have a tendency to be
very<00:01:46.390> straight<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.410> don't<00:01:47.470> like<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.950> look

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
very straight and I don't like that look

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.880 
very straight and I don't like that look
so<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:49.479> tried<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.930> arch<00:01:50.200> them<00:01:50.500> basically

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
so I just tried to arch them basically

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:03.140 
so I just tried to arch them basically
as<00:01:51.070> much<00:01:51.280> as<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.520> can

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.340 

usually<00:02:04.150> when<00:02:04.300> there's<00:02:04.480> a<00:02:04.570> hair<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.020> I'm

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
usually when there's a hair that I'm

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.710 
usually when there's a hair that I'm
unsure<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.400> want<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.760> pluck<00:02:06.970> or<00:02:07.180> not<00:02:07.360> like

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
unsure if I want to pluck or not like

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.680 
unsure if I want to pluck or not like
I'm<00:02:07.960> unsure<00:02:08.530> whether<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.340> want<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.880> there<00:02:10.119> I

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
I'm unsure whether I want it there I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.640 
I'm unsure whether I want it there I
just<00:02:11.110> grab<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.960> push<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.410> down

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
just grab it like this and push it down

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.210 
just grab it like this and push it down
and<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:16.690> how<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:17.050> eyebrow<00:02:17.470> looks<00:02:17.710> without<00:02:17.860> it

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and see how my eyebrow looks without it

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.430 
and see how my eyebrow looks without it
so<00:02:18.880> I'm<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.270> remove<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.930> line<00:02:20.230> of

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so I'm going to remove that line of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.230 
so I'm going to remove that line of
hairs<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.190> I've<00:02:21.280> seen<00:02:21.490> how<00:02:21.640> my<00:02:21.820> eyebrow

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
hairs now that I've seen how my eyebrow

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:37.400 
hairs now that I've seen how my eyebrow
looks<00:02:22.510> without<00:02:22.690> them<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.350> like<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.280> way

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.810 

now<00:02:38.410> I'm<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.740> go<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.190> area<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
now I'm going to go to this area of the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.280 
now I'm going to go to this area of the
brow<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.330> tend<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.630> have<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.810> lot<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.050> little

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
brow I tend to have a lot of little

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.890 
brow I tend to have a lot of little
stray<00:02:41.830> hairs<00:02:41.860> there<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:43.240> I'd<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.690> take

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
stray hairs there but I'd like to take

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.230 
stray hairs there but I'd like to take
out<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.000> go<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> bit<00:02:46.510> more<00:02:46.840> wild<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.650> guess

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.570 

moving<00:02:52.240> on<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> top<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.580> remove

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
moving on to the top I just remove

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.550 
moving on to the top I just remove
whatever's<00:02:55.300> outside<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.840> line<00:02:56.050> again

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
whatever's outside the line again

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.290 
whatever's outside the line again
I<00:02:56.590> never<00:02:57.100> remove<00:02:57.430> anything<00:02:57.730> from<00:02:57.910> this

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
I never remove anything from this

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.600 
I never remove anything from this
because<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> top<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.530> my<00:02:59.770> arch<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.430> I

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
because this is the top of my arch and I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.180 
because this is the top of my arch and I
don't<00:03:00.670> have<00:03:01.030> more<00:03:01.450> hairs<00:03:01.750> than<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.140> there<00:03:02.440> so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
don't have more hairs than that there so

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:19.330 
don't have more hairs than that there so
I<00:03:03.459> don't<00:03:03.670> want<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.000> remove<00:03:04.239> what<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> have

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.070 

and<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.550> course<00:03:20.820> in<00:03:21.180> between<00:03:21.600> your

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
and then of course in between your

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.110 
and then of course in between your
eyebrows<00:03:22.530> because<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.130> always<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.550> couple

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
eyebrows because you always get a couple

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.820 
eyebrows because you always get a couple
little<00:03:24.360> hairs<00:03:24.720> there<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.260> no<00:03:25.440> one<00:03:25.560> wants<00:03:25.800> a

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
little hairs there and no one wants a

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.270 
little hairs there and no one wants a
monobrow

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
monobrow

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.810 
monobrow
so<00:03:30.620> now<00:03:31.620> once<00:03:31.860> I'm<00:03:32.010> done<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.430> tweezing

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
so now once I'm done with the tweezing

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.880 
so now once I'm done with the tweezing
and<00:03:33.300> I'm<00:03:33.390> happy<00:03:33.720> with<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.990> overall<00:03:34.440> shape<00:03:34.680> of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
and I'm happy with the overall shape of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.980 
and I'm happy with the overall shape of
it<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.610> what<00:03:35.880> hairs<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.510> there<00:03:36.750> and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
it and with what hairs are there and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.130 
it and with what hairs are there and
which<00:03:37.590> ones<00:03:37.800> aren't<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.340> grab<00:03:39.150> one<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.930> these

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
which ones aren't I grab one of these

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.060 
which ones aren't I grab one of these
and<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.010> grab<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.700> small<00:03:42.240> scissor<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.800> just

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
and I grab a small scissor and I just

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.390 
and I grab a small scissor and I just
trimmed<00:03:44.400> them<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.790> because<00:03:45.210> i<00:03:45.480> never<00:03:45.720> use

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
trimmed them of it because i never use

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.890 
trimmed them of it because i never use
eyebrow<00:03:47.400> gel<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.850> just<00:03:48.180> don't<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.480> eyebrow

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
eyebrow gel I just don't like eyebrow

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.380 
eyebrow gel I just don't like eyebrow
gel<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.170> don't<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> way<00:03:49.800> it<00:03:49.860> feels<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:51.060> I

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
gel I don't like the way it feels so I

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.500 
gel I don't like the way it feels so I
never<00:03:51.510> use<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.460> therefore<00:03:53.460> I<00:03:53.970> need<00:03:54.090> my

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
never use it and therefore I need my

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.960 
never use it and therefore I need my
longer<00:03:54.990> eyebrows<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.070> trimmed<00:03:56.520> down<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.760> bit

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
longer eyebrows to be trimmed down a bit

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.250 
longer eyebrows to be trimmed down a bit
so<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.150> they<00:03:57.390> don't<00:03:57.510> pop<00:03:57.780> everywhere

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
so that they don't pop everywhere

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.220 
so that they don't pop everywhere
because<00:03:58.800> they<00:03:59.070> do<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.730> lot<00:04:03.230> after

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
because they do that a lot after

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.220 
because they do that a lot after
brushing<00:04:04.470> them<00:04:04.830> up<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.670> look<00:04:05.970> at<00:04:06.230> whatever

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
brushing them up I just look at whatever

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.370 
brushing them up I just look at whatever
is<00:04:07.410> out<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.680> place<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.850> usually<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.200> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
is out of place I usually have just a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.470 
is out of place I usually have just a
couple<00:04:10.800> here<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.520> like<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.940> trim<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.240> bit

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
couple here that I like to trim a bit

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.360 
couple here that I like to trim a bit
just<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.680> tiny<00:04:14.070> bit<00:04:15.140> like<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.100> all

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
just a tiny bit like so so that it's all

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.060 
just a tiny bit like so so that it's all
nice<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:17.940> even<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.780> then<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.380> usually<00:04:19.650> go<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
nice and even and then I usually go a

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.920 
nice and even and then I usually go a
bit<00:04:20.280> crazy<00:04:20.489> with<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.940> trimming<00:04:21.209> back<00:04:21.450> here

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
bit crazy with the trimming back here

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.510 
bit crazy with the trimming back here
because<00:04:22.109> as<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:22.650> see<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.950> get<00:04:23.160> quite<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> few

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
because as you can see I get quite a few

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.690 
because as you can see I get quite a few
long<00:04:23.970> ones<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.710> they<00:04:25.710> kind<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.010> mess<00:04:26.220> up<00:04:26.430> my

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
long ones and they kind of mess up my

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.260 
long ones and they kind of mess up my
lines

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
lines

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.070 
lines
I<00:04:27.390> usually<00:04:27.900> trim<00:04:28.320> those

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.950 

I'm<00:04:35.800> gonna<00:04:36.490> trim<00:04:36.819> them<00:04:37.000> downwards<00:04:37.689> because

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
I'm gonna trim them downwards because

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.749 
I'm gonna trim them downwards because
they<00:04:38.710> also<00:04:38.889> go<00:04:39.189> that<00:04:39.370> way

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
they also go that way

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.589 
they also go that way
so<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:41.069> just<00:04:42.069> push<00:04:42.460> them<00:04:42.639> all<00:04:42.819> down<00:04:43.060> like<00:04:43.930> so<00:04:45.599> and

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
so I just push them all down like so and

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:56.939 
so I just push them all down like so and
then<00:04:47.229> cut<00:04:47.889> whatever<00:04:48.310> is<00:04:48.460> out<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.669> place<00:04:55.949> and

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
then cut whatever is out of place and
