and<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.500> week<00:00:04.680> I've<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:04.920> implementing

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
and this week I've been implementing

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.940 
and this week I've been implementing
support<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.180> enchanted<00:00:06.839> items<00:00:07.200> as<00:00:07.649> well<00:00:07.830> as

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
support for enchanted items as well as

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.890 
support for enchanted items as well as
adding<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.309> couple<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.730> new<00:00:08.910> mobs<00:00:09.300> into<00:00:09.809> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
adding a couple of new mobs into the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.799 
adding a couple of new mobs into the
game<00:00:10.519> but<00:00:11.519> first<00:00:11.940> off<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.330> want<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.570> show<00:00:12.660> you

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
game but first off I want to show you

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.629 
game but first off I want to show you
the<00:00:12.990> icon<00:00:13.440> particle<00:00:13.980> effects<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the icon particle effects that I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
the icon particle effects that I
mentioned<00:00:15.030> briefly<00:00:15.240> last<00:00:15.719> time<00:00:16.020> because<00:00:16.379> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
mentioned briefly last time because this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
mentioned briefly last time because this
week<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.980> improved<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> system<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.090> finished

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
week I improved the system and finished

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.439 
week I improved the system and finished
implementing<00:00:19.080> them<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:20.910> set<00:00:21.180> any

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
implementing them so I can now set any

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.990 
implementing them so I can now set any
icon<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.140> emit<00:00:22.410> particles<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.310> when<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> do

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
icon to emit particles and when I do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
icon to emit particles and when I do
that<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> icon<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:24.990> start<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.410> randomly

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that the icon will start to randomly

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.750 
that the icon will start to randomly
generate<00:00:26.460> 2d<00:00:26.849> quads<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> quads

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
generate 2d quads like this the quads

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
generate 2d quads like this the quads
are<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.090> textured<00:00:30.630> using<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.050> texture<00:00:31.500> Atlas

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
are then textured using a texture Atlas

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.040 
are then textured using a texture Atlas
and<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.820> particle<00:00:33.239> fades<00:00:33.450> linearly<00:00:33.930> through

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and the particle fades linearly through

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
and the particle fades linearly through
all<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> different<00:00:35.040> stages<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> Atlas

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
all the different stages of the Atlas

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.869 
all the different stages of the Atlas
throughout<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> particles<00:00:37.200> life<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:38.730> also

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
throughout the particles life I can also

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.400 
throughout the particles life I can also
choose<00:00:39.149> how<00:00:39.210> many<00:00:39.600> particles<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.320> emitted

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
choose how many particles are emitted

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.729 
choose how many particles are emitted
per<00:00:40.890> second<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.780> choose<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.140> large<00:00:43.379> or

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
per second I can choose how large or

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.639 
per second I can choose how large or
small<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> particles<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.320> how<00:00:46.320> long

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
small the particles are and how long

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.000 
small the particles are and how long
they<00:00:46.890> stay<00:00:47.190> alive<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.410> created<00:00:49.800> these

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
they stay alive for so I created these

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
they stay alive for so I created these
icon<00:00:50.370> effects<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> enchanting<00:00:51.600> update

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
icon effects for the enchanting update

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
icon effects for the enchanting update
that<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.170> worked<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> week<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that I worked on this week so that I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.130 
that I worked on this week so that I
could<00:00:53.850> use<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.239> particle<00:00:54.570> effects<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
could use the particle effects to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
could use the particle effects to
indicate<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.070> item<00:00:56.219> has<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> certain

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
indicate when an item has a certain

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.979 
indicate when an item has a certain
enchantment

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
enchantment

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
enchantment
I<00:00:58.109> haven't<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.250> added<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.789> mechanics

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
I haven't actually added the mechanics

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.540 
I haven't actually added the mechanics
for<00:01:00.539> enchanting<00:01:01.170> weapons<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.620> armor<00:01:01.859> yet<00:01:02.039> but

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
for enchanting weapons and armor yet but

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
for enchanting weapons and armor yet but
I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.850> implemented<00:01:03.300> support<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.170> enchanted

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I have implemented support for enchanted

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.580 
I have implemented support for enchanted
items<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.479> mouse<00:01:06.720> over<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.110> item<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
items you can now mouse over an item to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
items you can now mouse over an item to
see<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.860> enchantments<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> has<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
see what enchantments it has so here you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
see what enchantments it has so here you
can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.710> sword<00:01:11.010> has<00:01:11.130> sharpness

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
can see that this sword has sharpness

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.780 
can see that this sword has sharpness
and<00:01:12.240> life<00:01:12.960> SAP<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.250> also<00:01:14.369> five

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and life SAP there are also five

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
and life SAP there are also five
different<00:01:15.270> tiers<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.869> enchantments<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
different tiers of enchantments so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.260 
different tiers of enchantments so
eventually<00:01:17.460> you'll<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.939> able<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
eventually you'll actually be able to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
eventually you'll actually be able to
upgrade<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> enchants<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.770> items<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
upgrade the enchants on your items and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.100 
upgrade the enchants on your items and
you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> different<00:01:21.689> tiers<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you can see the different tiers of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
you can see the different tiers of
enchantments<00:01:22.770> shown<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.220> slightly<00:01:23.580> different

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
enchantments shown in slightly different

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.179 
enchantments shown in slightly different
colors<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.560> higher<00:01:25.830> level

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
colors here with the higher level

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
colors here with the higher level
enchantments<00:01:26.820> being<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.299> darker<00:01:27.780> shade<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
enchantments being a darker shade of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740 
enchantments being a darker shade of
purple<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.390> tricky<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
purple and I know it's a bit tricky to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
purple and I know it's a bit tricky to
read<00:01:31.049> right<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:32.009> round<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
read right now but I will get round to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
read right now but I will get round to
redoing<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> text<00:01:33.360> rendering<00:01:33.689> system<00:01:34.110> fairly

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
redoing the text rendering system fairly

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.660 
redoing the text rendering system fairly
soon<00:01:35.329> each<00:01:36.329> item<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> three

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
soon each item can have up to three

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
soon each item can have up to three
enchantments<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> each<00:01:39.180> enchantments<00:01:40.110> can

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
enchantments and each enchantments can

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
enchantments and each enchantments can
have<00:01:40.439> its<00:01:40.590> own<00:01:40.740> icon<00:01:41.250> particle<00:01:41.790> effect<00:01:42.060> so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
have its own icon particle effect so

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
have its own icon particle effect so
these<00:01:43.110> boots<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.979> super<00:01:44.520> speed<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
these boots here have super speed and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
these boots here have super speed and
you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.290> has<00:01:46.470> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you can see that for now it has this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
you can see that for now it has this
sparkly<00:01:47.250> particle<00:01:47.729> effect<00:01:48.030> these<00:01:48.869> boots<00:01:49.079> over

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
sparkly particle effect these boots over

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
sparkly particle effect these boots over
here<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.860> jumped<00:01:50.340> boost<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.600> boots

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
here have jumped boost but these boots

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960 
here have jumped boost but these boots
here<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.470> both<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.829> those<00:01:53.159> enchantments<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
here have both of those enchantments and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.330 
here have both of those enchantments and
so<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> icon<00:01:54.960> shows<00:01:55.259> both<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> particle

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so the icon shows both of the particle

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.200 
so the icon shows both of the particle
effects

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
effects

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240

and<00:01:57.299> these<00:01:57.840> enchantments<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.650> actually<00:01:59.010> work

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and these enchantments do actually work

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
and these enchantments do actually work
as<00:01:59.490> well<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.479> wear<00:02:00.720> these<00:02:00.869> boots<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.290> can
