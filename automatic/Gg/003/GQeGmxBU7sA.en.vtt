00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 so it's a basin that has been 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.390
 designed a few months ago with a filter 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.860
 traditional to which the customer has 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.599
 wanted to add a little touch a little 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.360
 little vegetation that will allow to have a 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.860
 frustration in addition to natural must have 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.920
 obligatorily a circuit of water in a 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.080
 ocean if we want to avoid that tail that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 lolo does not die what needs and 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 of oxygen that form 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 it is necessary that the matter 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.590
 organic on degraded because 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.870
 that otherwise you have a layer of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.250
 base that will form in the bottom 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.780
 then you kept some plants that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.640
 will tend to trouble a lot 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 the water and it's going to hide the light is going 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 lunar light and oxygen are 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.309
 two elements that are very important 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 in a pool so we went on a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.220
 first classical filter system with 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.989
 the incoming water arrive pump which 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.120
 arrives in a first filter the water is 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 filtered with a UV lamp that will avoid 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 to have too much green algae to put on 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.450
 in place and once the first 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 infiltration makes water by two worms 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.830
 different directions so a first 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.360
 who will feed the first waterfall and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.680
 the second that she will spend in the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.060
 second filter that he needed to be 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.990
 natural so the natural filter it's 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.990
 a layer of about fifteen 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 centimeters of gravel that is filled 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.560
 of water that charge what is called in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.799
 load and on which are implanted 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.210
 irises or plants and did it on 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.100
 natural filter with several functions 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.950
 which he already has a first function 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.560
 mechanical with a filter that operate 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.689
 by the passage of water in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 gravel so more to several types of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.950
 gravel that can be used but 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.020
 one of those who adapt best is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.740
 know it pozzolan so we're on 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.630
 a volcanic rock 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.719
 so this function she has a son ton 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.679
 mechanics and also allows our 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.159
 bacteria to grow 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.109
 it's a shelter for bacteria is that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.149
 that it's bacteria that go that 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.200
 will start filtration the system 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.969
 Filtration 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.950
 they will degrade the material 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.920
 organic water they are going to degrade 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.090
 in mineral matter and then this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.860
 organic matter that is degraded in 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.379
 mineral matter will be absorbed by the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.260
 plants in general on a system of 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.849
 natural filtration one goes on a 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.500
 third of two sons compared to lead 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.180
 the basin these proportions that are 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.030
 acquired are quite important to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.319
 respect here we can see that the volume 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.840
 of water to filter a little more 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.260
 important compared to the filters we 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.319
 has in place 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.030
 we also have a fish population 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.269
 which is quite high so we always 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.580
 tend to have algae that door 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.750
 in the background because we have one of the zot 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.790
 to filter a little more important 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.349
 so here for example we went on a 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.870
 fish that they will eat the grass 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.090
 white loves and one can also 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.970
 put freshwater mussels that is 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.340
 despite their small size they 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.140
 have the ability to filter a cubic meter 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.110
 of water a day it's impressive 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.200
 after they are done to be effective at 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.690
 100% but it still contributes to the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.250
 good quality to find in a 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.760
 basin the system that can be found at 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.160
 the natural state with the natural filter on 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.110
 we also have a recipe that pleases 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.150
 still as much in the gardens is 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.850
 the marriage of the vegetable of the mineral and 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.050
 the aquatic so that's a mixture that has 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.590
 always pleased that always pleases 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.760
 and this is the opportunity to associate these 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.730
 three main elements 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.580
 in terms more so it's true that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.900
 there is no maintenance it's a small 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.690
 little is a lot less work in 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.310
 the time it has no filter has changed in 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.590
 plus it's a little less less 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.910
 expensive energy 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.390
 finally if we just go on a 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.650
 pump 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.570
 there is no denying it to feed 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.950
 and that's also the aesthetic aspect 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.209
 so in addition we can play on 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.120
 different types of plants you can 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.830
 to adapt several plants of the reeds 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.680
 irises and resolves that also plays 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.940
 act that these are the colors and that 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.310
 always brings a little life 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.350
 with an ecosystem that is taking shape 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.350
 around the basin and he
