 Because only be described say whether Tteyuu is after the bot will come what has changed and Well 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.220
 The reaction speed after finding me and the enemy finding me 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.220
 Accuracy 9 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.810

 I Toka 4 seconds Toka Therm Ya Toka Toka ring 1 seconds Once Well, for example, this Ya' 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:31.030
 For example 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:34.140
 I'm thinking of picking a rookie this time because the raid is changing 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.440
 Oh So I know 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.690
 If you want to increase your reaction speed 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.720
 Walking 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.530

 Let's use Fast Maglightweight Premature Dexterity x Condition 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.989
 I think that 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.989

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.819
 Well it means the free For All is good at what 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.000
 I can explain it explaining though 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.380
 Because it will be a little longer 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.120
 I will omit the score 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.470
 Is 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.379
 The first time 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.480
 The first one of and say, another point took described it a part 1 is a 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:57.860
 You hit while moving 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.450
 The second one to hit while moving 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.230
 The number of consciousness while conscious of smooth m like mouse 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.230
 To beauty consciousness Tsu be conscious while awareness 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.230
 It in the third I is to say in grinded Nde to consciousness 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.400
 And what 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.490
 At that moment 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.830
 When the advance 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.940
 It's advances while holding the shaft this day 2 to f leaf 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.400
 I will try to do it on 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.400
 For now, if you can attend the class, defeat 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.690
 I 1 dead 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.460
 Find will soon defeat the enemy with the axis Once defeated in 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.540
 Therefore let big students 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.540
 I think water support 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.620
 I'm tapping Chi and Carly efficiency, but this time the story is 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.910
 Hey that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.910
 I do not think I will 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.820
 also talk or something huh do I look at smap large how much of the interval 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.820
 This time 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.670
 Please make the axis of Hetalia bloom as soon as you feel it 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.409
 It is two school buildings from defeat conception 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:21.780
 This is also the direction of the sound 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.900
 With the time being axis Once you dare faction is not suitable 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.500
 It is the composition of the poster which searches for the axis 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.470
 There is 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.030
 If you beat it , you will be hit high and high 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.030
 But I thought the north 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.889
 Is it 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.669
 Right 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.669

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.080
 Slipped 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.319
 No bus 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.480
 If defeated, Chicos feels 10 times as dark as genetics 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.880
 I'm sorry, please go over 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.880
 Use this in Yakuho 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.539
 If there are several people, do you beat them in that order 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.410
 If you look beyond the second person 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.410
 Subdivision and defeat from the enemy looking at me 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.849
 If there is such a horse name ぇ be bold post , it will be 11 again 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.300
 Different mixed with I 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.900
 uru remember 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.900
 Be deceived 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.960
 Control radio control with axis 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.570
 Was doing 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.020
 Be deceived 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.520
 eh 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.520
 Can use axis 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.330
 Everything goes from defeat 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.419
 Hot one 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.550
 It When you have so that's it for me to tell 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.980
 After the accident 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.940
 It looks like it should be defeated 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.940
 Bai in the nuances 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.139
 Just use the axis 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.500
 If it were 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:18.969
 Ha 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:20.249
 There are many stripe weaves in the foyer, and I think it is okay to explain in detail. 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.449
 Well good day 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:30.120

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:30.120
 Eye-fi render seems that there is no interesting also probably be doing that there was pop 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.630
 Let's find it yourself 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.260
 This is the back sulfa raised here park and 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.260
 Really cute 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.810
 Osutora time Whoa 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:53.169

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.169
 What Deko will 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.240
 Water cancer 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.849
 Quite Once defeated 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.760
 Whiting strikers 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:09.889
 If you can afford, I will aim at my head 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.819
 Jude 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.819
 You are what 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.600
 Early 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.600
 Well , I wanted to explain this time 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.830
 As the door leading end 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.830
 I will hold my own 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:33.569
 I forgot to explain 3 points 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:36.880
 Sold while moving, but hit while moving 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:40.450
 m also tried to have a smooth picture 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.639
 Well I was able to bring the axis with Clearing Moss 

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.900
 The 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:47.720
 As soon as you defeated the enemy, you were looking for an axis in time 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.020
 Do this 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.740
 I think in and want to end 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.740
