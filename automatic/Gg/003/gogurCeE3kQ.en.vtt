 paraguay is the market in brazil 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.609
 Brazil with cartons of spelled profi 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.949

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.919
 a party in columbia that i mean 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.970
 my hope or I will go from it 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:35.660
 out of that too tomorrow ours 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.789
 impartial portraits from Mexico just 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.559
 These things will be the last 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.829
 But then I saw the game too 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.690
 that this physicality is in brazil 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.940
 against columbia that this 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.879
 physicality and these in these 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.250
 almost over the borders 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.769
 In addition, also has been operated in 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.190
 europe when i saw the game in 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.530
 Europe would not have 22 players this 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.949
 game ended there was already so 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.590
 many very hard and brutal fouls 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.750
 this physical game somehow and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.970
 Stop this with all means 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.610
 that has almost been exaggerated 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.670
 is and this development is that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.360
 of course also to watch 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.330
 I think that one then already 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.670
 a little bit there must see that these things 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.430
 then this very brutal and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.930
 rustic inserts and fist ii too 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 be stopped and need in 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.149
 future no emas and no messis and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.340
 no ozil gÃ¶tze and pruss more 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.049
 but other players have the same 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.689
 everything just somehow destroy that 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.840
 also dangerous so this this wm 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.990
 is under the motto we know of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.069
