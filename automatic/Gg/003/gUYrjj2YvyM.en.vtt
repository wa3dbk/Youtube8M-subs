00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
more faster and propose to a point where

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
more faster and propose to a point where
you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.460> catch<00:00:29.670> those<00:00:29.880> part<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.449> issues

this what I'm trying to teach closing in
your<00:00:38.160> top<00:00:38.309> box<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:38.969> faster<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
your top box you can actually faster and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.700 
your top box you can actually faster and
getting<00:00:40.079> those<00:00:40.200> beats<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:41.040> first<00:00:41.340> step<00:00:42.149> in

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
getting those beats my first step in

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.340 
getting those beats my first step in

you're dancing in place do sitting there
a<00:01:46.920> good<00:01:47.400> example

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
a good example

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
a good example
dancing<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.900> place<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.680> Paul

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.609 

we're<00:02:01.369> using<00:02:01.520> some<00:02:01.909> people<00:02:02.600> gel<00:02:02.780> when<00:02:03.500> it's

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
we're using some people gel when it's

helped me develop other top rocks and be

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.330 
helped me develop other top rocks and be
a<00:02:07.609> little<00:02:07.880> faster<00:02:08.330> even<00:02:09.019> with<00:02:09.170> my<00:02:09.289> white<00:02:10.039> ones

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
a little faster even with my white ones

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.790 
a little faster even with my white ones
I<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:10.970> actually<00:02:11.090> use<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.349> point<00:02:12.620> where

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
I can actually use it to the point where

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.420 
I can actually use it to the point where
I<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:13.069> pick<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:14.019> going<00:02:15.019> back<00:02:15.200> even<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.190> in

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
I can pick it going back even if it's in

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.280 
I can pick it going back even if it's in
here<00:02:16.670> coming<00:02:17.390> here<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.629> even<00:02:17.810> if<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.049> why

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
here coming here and even if it's why

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.710 
here coming here and even if it's why
this<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.739> supposed<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.129> slow<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.030> be

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.979 

smaller

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
smaller

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.900 
smaller
everything<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:24.590> close<00:02:24.769> really<00:02:25.069> short<00:02:25.370> really

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
everything can close really short really

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.960 
everything can close really short really
closed<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.739> being<00:02:27.950> said<00:02:28.040> give<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
closed in so that being said give it a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.990 
closed in so that being said give it a
