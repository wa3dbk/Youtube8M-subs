 next to me 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.910
 so if we do the test I send it 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.040

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.310
 we see that the application works 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.870
 correctly we will return to the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.329
 settings to see what the others are 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.799
 options then the delay allowing that a 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.260
 nobody sends you a message that I 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.970

 nobody every time that text that 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.000
 that sends a message you can say 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.590

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.510
 minutes and well know how to send the

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.060
 question 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.549

 a signature if you want to add 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.720

 we want to go down a little bit 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.900
 further down we can do a white list 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.940
 so if we go in the white list where you 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.070

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.050
 settings in the auto respond 2 in the morning 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.570
 we put it off when you're busy 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.610

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.120
 sox that will happen when you go 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.250
 activate the do not disturb option 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.260
 automatically the option of simply 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.840
 around and sponsors will be activating at the 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.030
 let's put it back, so that's fine 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.800
 meets this message there if I lai off 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.930
 and I miss the same person 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.300
 well it 's not going to answer me because 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.000
 it works with do not disturb 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.710
 so it's made that one off for 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.140
 the application around the sponsors is 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.400
 by putting the 9 not to disturb fax 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.900
 and what is a benefit anyway 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.790
 went well by the developers 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.530
 can not ben if everything for 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.660
 the application to the Taliban and six points 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.400
 at most then for the application 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.090
 authorize however two young rats 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.260
 total of 5 stars 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.280
 so why five stars because 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.290
 personally it's a very good 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.120
 application that responds to 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.800
 morning sms or messages 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.870
 especially when you are busy pitt 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.820
 the world are a little impatient of in 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.350
 live who are waiting for you to answer a 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.330
 been recovered who can not answer 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.800
 and this application will help you 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.150
 so I think I put 5 stars 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.010
 you every public have many paintings 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.300
