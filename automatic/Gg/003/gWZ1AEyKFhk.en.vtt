blood<00:01:15.060> k<00:01:15.240> magazine<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.990> setup<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> same

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
blood k magazine the setup is the same

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.920 
blood k magazine the setup is the same
and<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> items<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.479> same<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and a lot of the items are the same a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890 
and a lot of the items are the same a
lot<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> items<00:01:19.860> no<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> definitely

lot of the items no but it definitely

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
lot of the items no but it definitely
seemed<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.060> militant

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
seemed a little bit more on the militant

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 
seemed a little bit more on the militant
side<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.409> things<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> mean<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> look

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
really focuses a little bit more on

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
really focuses a little bit more on
preparedness<00:01:35.070> slash<00:01:35.579> survival<00:01:36.090> stuff

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
