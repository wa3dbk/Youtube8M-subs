00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.299
 your iphone as internet router for 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 Internet 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.700
 low register and a last word 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.680

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.800
 you first have to be with the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.930
 Your father was disconnected or not he 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 can not be connected to any network 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.079
 so you left on it goes 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.170
 automatically the area is needed 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.760
 that's where your body can be when you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.960

 personal access here in settings 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:53.719

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.719
