00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.680 
curious about I have recommended
searching<00:00:35.220> pathways<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.940> many<00:00:36.060> people<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
searching pathways to so many people and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
searching pathways to so many people and
everyone<00:00:37.470> that<00:00:37.739> has<00:00:37.890> come<00:00:38.130> has<00:00:38.399> been<00:00:38.550> so

with their children and the information

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.910 
with their children and the information
that<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.250> learning<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:45.920> brain

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that they're learning about brain

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.209 
that they're learning about brain
development<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.790> about<00:00:48.719> themselves<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
development and about themselves so I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
development and about themselves so I
really<00:00:50.579> feel<00:00:50.790> as<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.030> nutrient<00:00:51.750> nurturing

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
really feel as if nutrient nurturing

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650 
really feel as if nutrient nurturing
pathways<00:00:52.469> allows<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.309> child's<00:00:53.820> whole<00:00:54.059> being<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
emotions I just feel nurturing pathways

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
emotions I just feel nurturing pathways
has<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.239> been<00:01:00.420> great<00:01:00.660> we've<00:01:00.870> signed<00:01:01.140> we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
has has been great we've signed we

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.750 
has has been great we've signed we
signed<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> once<00:01:02.219> before<00:01:02.460> she<00:01:02.670> could

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
signed up for it once before she could

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.340 
signed up for it once before she could
crawl<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.149> signed<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.570> again<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.140> again

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
crawl we signed up again and again

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
crawl we signed up again and again
because<00:01:05.220> nurturing<00:01:05.940> pathways<00:01:06.299> has<00:01:06.450> been<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
because nurturing pathways has been so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.170 
because nurturing pathways has been so
much<00:01:06.990> fun<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.799> both<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> us<00:01:08.250> we've<00:01:08.880> both

crawling and walking backwards and all
the<00:01:18.600> things<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.560> teacher<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:19.950> also

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the things we do the teacher will also

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
the things we do the teacher will also
tell<00:01:20.820> us<00:01:20.850> things<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.390> development<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
tell us things about development and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.109 
tell us things about development and
about<00:01:22.500> learning<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:24.000> your

has<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.280> helped<00:01:26.909> me<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> parent<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.720> well

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
has really helped me as a parent as well
I<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> most<00:01:29.130> important<00:01:29.580> things

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I think one of the most important things

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.380 
I think one of the most important things
for<00:01:29.939> me<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.210> nurturing<00:01:30.390> pathways<00:01:31.020> was<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
for me with nurturing pathways was the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.060 
for me with nurturing pathways was the
understanding<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.479> how<00:01:33.780> movement<00:01:34.680> connects

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
understanding of how movement connects

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.030 
understanding of how movement connects
to<00:01:35.460> building<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> neural<00:01:37.049> networks<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to building of neural networks and the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
to building of neural networks and the
whole<00:01:38.159> scientific<00:01:38.460> approach<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.240> nurturing

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
whole scientific approach of nurturing

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.670 
whole scientific approach of nurturing
pathways<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.840> imperative<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.170> me<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.650> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
pathways is imperative for me as a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
pathways is imperative for me as a
mother<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:44.939> doing<00:01:45.150> the
