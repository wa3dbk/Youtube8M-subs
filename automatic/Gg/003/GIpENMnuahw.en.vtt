 does with the wheat we see a pizza that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.539

 they are two loaves and the meat also with 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.069

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.869
 avn mayo this is a chicken with mayonnaise 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.630
 it is supposed to be complete that is the 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.100
 meat with mayonnaise and with two loaves and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.869
 I say there's a lot a lot of food 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.319
 we can also do the feat with 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.580
 pasta meat cheese xx meat services 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.470
 of chop as he has also commented 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.119
 they have gone for fish with the little one 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.189
 without lechuguita also as to what themes 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 You also like this one that is salmon and 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.200
 the other one is fish 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 and here you can also see a lot of salmon 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 so we can make a sandwich and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.410
 here is the pizza that I love as 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.660
 You see I love it and also something that I 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.070
 loved it is that we also have 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.619
 utensils that is a knife a frying pan 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.390
 and a pizza cutter because you do not 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.310
 You can like pizza if you do not have the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 pizza cutter which I do not know is something 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.869
 that the creator added also and that is 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.700
 pretty good come here we use the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.590
 cutter and stuffs us say 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.600
 practically all of life every time 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.160
 we take a slice of the pizza and do not 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680
 we can take it with nothing else 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.530
 I do not know with pizza cutter let 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.239
 to do a little bit of damage to be able to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.739
 eat some other little things and see 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.840
 more than anything we believe that it is a 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.130
 excuse me if suddenly the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.900
 I'm not really sure why 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.850
 that happens but I'm going to my tablet is already 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.470
 rock and it's so I hope the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.020
 understand for example here I have your 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.060
 meat sandwich that is steak me 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.739
 it looks and heals us five hearts what 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.500
 which is not bad for us 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.300
 again a little bit of damage and we're going to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.860
 try another one also for example 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.380
 the cheese you can eat also sorghum 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.760
 I almost died was near the cheese 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.830
 later as he alone see here the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.320
 I can not do it, I can not do it 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.540
 eat less except in the cutter ni 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.269
 with the knife even here we have the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.890
 cutter and here like the pizza heals us 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.560
 each slice is completely the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.480
 life so it's really worth this 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.250
 this food I tell you here we have 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.810
 many many many can get 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.910
 look here I make another pizza because I do not 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.650
 is going to end that then we become another 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.340
 visit to an apology again if you 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.350
 Lock not pass do not know why that is already 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.910
 old lady the tablet remember here we 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.070
 we do a little bit of damage we eat 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.860
 this last piece and we put a pizza 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.420
 new is incredible the truth I tell you 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.430
 everything is completely character speak 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.269
 everything can be achieved without any 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.420
 problem 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.799
 I think the sand the sand the salt that 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.600
 use to make the mayonnaise I think it 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.459
 get with the sand I do not remember very 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.680
 well the truth and so the thing that you 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.510
 go indicating little by little also 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.280
 we have an egg here 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.720
 cooked that told them about watermelon juice 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.390
 let's drink watermelon juice to see 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.550
 how much life goes up 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.840
 and the truth is that it is very cool 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.280
 creator right now I'm going to show you the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.750
 transforms the download because it is in the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.180
 registration because I found it in 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.880

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.300
 two and a half hearts what juice is 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.980
 of watermelon which is not bad at all 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.100
 watermelon alone personally recovers you 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.540
 we leave here this little watermelon and 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.910
 we take for example this egg 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.620
 then fried there we have it what 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.110
 we eat with everything and the pan because yes and 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.510
 He healed us enough little hearts 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.640
 four more or less and I'm not wrong 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.350
 and we turn to do a little damage 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.930

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.040
 little knife that the cheese that lasagna does not 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.660
