played boys hockey for a Strathcona and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.540 
played boys hockey for a Strathcona and
it<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.090> definitely<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> different<00:00:36.809> experience

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
it was definitely a different experience

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
it was definitely a different experience
not<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.700> good<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.030> relationships<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.739> gain

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
not as good of relationships as you gain

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.840 
not as good of relationships as you gain
with<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> girls<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.059> guess<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:44.040> more

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
with the girls I guess I was more more

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549 
with the girls I guess I was more more
playing<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> boys<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:46.079> therefore<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
playing with the boys more therefore the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.680 
playing with the boys more therefore the
game<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.190> much<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> relationships<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
game not as much for the relationships I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
game not as much for the relationships I
learned<00:00:49.140> their<00:00:49.500> style<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.829> play<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
learned their style of play and then I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
learned their style of play and then I
took<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> girls<00:00:52.020> hockey<00:00:52.260> and
