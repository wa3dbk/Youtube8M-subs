00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.440
 is the eighth event was no different 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.410
 topping the list 2010 the brazilian jose aldo 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.019
 portfolios and finalizations 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.179
 lie 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.409
 certainly with one of the best nights sighted the corpse 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.760
 former owner of the highest featherweight belt 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.760
 so far on the right 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 missed favorite 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.410
 I dollars for the best at 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 the best finish was for the champion the yeast of greece purple belt 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.670
 of real jiu-jitsu 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.630
 and he the team returned to circulate with less than two minutes of fight the commission or 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.760
 plus an incredible presentation for correction 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 I just wanted to take four rounds every time 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.980
 in the main fight the Brazilian g1 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.300
 lots of the first belt defense 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 only that despite the low head before the start of the matches 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.430
 25 minutes later 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.940
 junior can raise his head as one of the best fighters in the world 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.000
 fc porto helton 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.170
 pilot at just 23 years of age 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 the featherweight champion was tripled from 1st to 5th year 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.860
 it's done technically 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.310
 tactically perfect 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.800
 now it's time to turn for more dearly loved unpopular to be literally 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.840
 after 23 years over the years 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.840
 each stone of the gávea gávea practically a final 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.470
 the structure was so damaged 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 I knew I needed to be towed at least once. 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.440
 pure heart emotion of 60 but did not resist at 25 minutes with one leg 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.170
 only 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.850
 but technically the champion will intimidate higher mind 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.330
 for the purpose of healing 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.659
 crosses 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.830
 no mercy 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.510
 and walk on the floor 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.700
 by unanimous decision, josé aldo defended on the basis of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.569
 pillow featherweight belt
