to<00:00:20.770> note<00:00:20.920> when<00:00:21.039> watching<00:00:21.280> all<00:00:21.580> this<00:00:21.760> is<00:00:21.940> that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
to note when watching all this is that

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.600 
to note when watching all this is that
this<00:00:22.240> is<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:22.420> very<00:00:22.780> early<00:00:23.440> idea<00:00:23.890> into<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.430> whole

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
this is a very early idea into the whole

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.400 
this is a very early idea into the whole
process<00:00:24.850> so<00:00:25.449> there's<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:25.750> lot<00:00:25.960> that's<00:00:26.140> going<00:00:26.289> to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
process so there's a lot that's going to

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.930 
process so there's a lot that's going to
be<00:00:26.500> changing<00:00:26.770> before<00:00:27.369> this<00:00:27.490> actually<00:00:27.820> becomes

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
be changing before this actually becomes

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.090 
be changing before this actually becomes
a<00:00:28.210> real<00:00:28.449> option<00:00:28.750> within<00:00:29.080> minecraft<00:00:29.650> now

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
things like raid their chests then

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.090

either not trade with you or just murder

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.170 
either not trade with you or just murder
you<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:47.950> that's<00:00:48.340> where<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.610> iron<00:00:48.850> golems

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
you and that's where the iron golems

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.000 
you and that's where the iron golems
came<00:00:49.390> in<00:00:49.540> this<00:00:49.809> could<00:00:50.110> be<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.469> beginning<00:00:50.559> of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
came in this could be the beginning of

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.950 
came in this could be the beginning of
how<00:00:51.250> we<00:00:51.309> might<00:00:51.579> see<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.000> process<00:00:52.450> evolving

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
how we might see this process evolving

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.049 
how we might see this process evolving
so<00:00:53.350> finally<00:00:53.710> here<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.250> new<00:00:54.489> gem<00:00:54.820> called

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
so finally here it is a new gem called

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.270 
so finally here it is a new gem called
the<00:00:55.270> emerald<00:00:55.780> which<00:00:56.020> is<00:00:56.140> green<00:00:56.410> however<00:00:57.010> you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
the emerald which is green however you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.700 
the emerald which is green however you
can<00:00:57.309> mine<00:00:57.730> these<00:00:58.000> from<00:00:58.420> an<00:00:58.570> emerald<00:00:59.020> ore<00:00:59.230> which

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
can mine these from an emerald ore which

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.560 
can mine these from an emerald ore which
is<00:00:59.860> actually<00:01:00.039> currently<00:01:00.340> red<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.210> Jeb<00:01:01.420> did

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
is actually currently red but Jeb did

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.670 
is actually currently red but Jeb did
say<00:01:01.750> these<00:01:01.930> will<00:01:02.050> be<00:01:02.170> green<00:01:02.379> as<00:01:02.500> well

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
say these will be green as well

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.680 
say these will be green as well
eventually<00:01:03.039> so<00:01:03.610> now<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:03.850> goal<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.149> to<00:01:04.329> use

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
eventually so now the goal is to use

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.750 
eventually so now the goal is to use
this<00:01:04.839> new<00:01:05.080> currency<00:01:05.530> participa<00:01:06.130> gates<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.549> buy

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
this new currency participa gates to buy

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.880 
this new currency participa gates to buy
and<00:01:07.060> trade<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:07.540> them<00:01:07.720> each<00:01:07.960> villager<00:01:08.590> sell

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
and trade with them each villager sell

and trade with them each villager sell
something<00:01:09.250> different<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:09.880> not<00:01:10.240> only<00:01:10.420> that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
something different but not only that

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.050 
something different but not only that
once<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.500> buy<00:01:11.740> something<00:01:12.190> or<00:01:12.340> sell<00:01:12.640> something

with them he gets a little bubbles
around<00:01:14.320> his<00:01:14.650> head<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.010> they<00:01:15.340> once<00:01:15.610> was<00:01:15.760> go

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
something different we did a little

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.820 
something different we did a little
testing<00:01:19.390> with<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.930> seems<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.229> be<00:01:20.500> up<00:01:20.680> to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
testing with this and seems to be up to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.890 
testing with this and seems to be up to
three<00:01:21.100> items<00:01:21.490> currently<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:22.240> course<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.810> the

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
future things like this are going to

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.740 
future things like this are going to
probably<00:01:24.340> change<00:01:24.700> or<00:01:25.000> increase<00:01:25.510> or<00:01:25.659> decrease

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
probably change or increase or decrease
