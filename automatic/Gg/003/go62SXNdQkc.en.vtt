00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello everyone welcome home rock 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.470
 online in this opportunity we are not going 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 to give a click or anything that no error 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.460
 of the game or anything like that but more 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 well it 's a curious trick since I like it 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 upload those tricks let's say how rare or 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 something that is different not only 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 raise level and experience to duplicate 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.189
 good vehicles so they will teach 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 how can the hood open the chest was 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.239
 the cover is where an engine of the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 vehicle as they call it in their countries already 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.770
 The truth is that I do not know how they tell me 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 that in my country we say the capo 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.800
 so let's see how they can 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.390
 do then why are they going to do this 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 Well, if you want to suddenly 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 take let's say screenshots 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.810
 decide even as if it were a 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 vehicle exhibition these studied 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.430
 here then it is for the people who 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 it really interests you then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 what we are going to do is simply 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 take a weapon that is enough power me 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.950
 I advise you to use this 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.800
 it seems the take this one that we got in the 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.180
 of lcd valentine so for those who 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.930
 they bought but what they can do is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.070
 do it with him 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.200
 snyder 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 let's say heavy but we're going to do is 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.930
 shoot him to the upper corner where 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.640
 start the field as 0 account and open a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 little but they have to do it from both 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.900
 sides then what will I be firing 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 for all is willing a bit of me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.550
 it also took me a while to do it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.630
 let's say it's not easy and many times 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.820
 let's say that when you shoot, the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 poster with the next bullet close 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 theses be very careful already let's say 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.670
 audio and it's going to show you have to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 accelerate slowly so it does not come back 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 to close the capo then you can see 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.610
 the engine I wanted to do it here with the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.500
 clinician sun phoenix as you want 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.330
 call because as I'm not careful with 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 this giant engine then felt 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.899
 curiosity about how the engine was 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.310
 there are some vehicles that are not 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.479
 justifies them to do this let alone 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.789
 right now I'm going to show you 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.350
 I also did it with the air then 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.020
 I want to show you what happens with the air 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850
 obviously open in the part 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.410
 forward and effectively be bad but 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.610
 so do not try to do it with the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.259
 vehicles that have the engine in 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.220
 back because they will not be able to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.929
 see you get great accounts because how do you 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.910
 I say as if it were an exhibitions of 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.739
 tuned vehicles and if I'm not bad 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.250
 do you ever ask me on twitter? 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.320
 logical 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.970
 for April and capo let's say that in that 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.800
 moment they do not have and then here what 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.420
 I bring for all the people that from 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 soon some curiosity is like 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.740
 like April or suddenly like to do 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.810
 let's say they had the inclusion ones that 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.460
 they would like to take captures with the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 let's say that with the hood open 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.959
 with the chest open then as it is 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.880
 they gave an account I did it with the phoenix 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.830
 Now I am going to show you the Sultan 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.320
 reverse is that this does look like a vehicle 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.000
 of these street races then 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.250
 really has no greater science is 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 Exactly the same thing just shoot 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.780
 in the upper part of the hood of the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.520
 chest returns as you say and 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.410
 let's say that the first part is more 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.450
 easy and the second takes a little more than 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.100
 time be careful to soon 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.480
 inertia of if we see shots because 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.580
 they can also obviously damage the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.320
 vehicle and they would have to pay the insurance 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.520
 all this is so let's say that if you do not 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.560
 it works we do not explain it 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.450
 they could open try to re-enter 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.360
 to the garage so the vehicle recovers 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.320
 totally and they can re-take it out 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.630
 and try again 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.820
 then as I tell you this vehicle that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.320
 you love is great i like it too and like 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.200
 I told them it's a challenge because it has pure 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.200
 paint or let's say you see 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.700
 of long street chains that if not 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.550
 Sultan actually have them 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.530
 I advise you to say it is not like 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.569
 so complicated to find it I have already 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.519
 the video of how can I find 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.920
 so if they want to be they go down in the 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.830
 description so that if they want to result 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.360
 and others and even objects to lower the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.580
 playlist in the destruction of this video 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.500
 so that suddenly Robert's function counts 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.510
 already there would be the capo then that is the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.200
 nothing engine are also curious and 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:51.769
 It depends on what I did open but another 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.390
 time then for the typical red with its 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.640
 space but good, I'm just going to 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.260
 show how it is done with the a of what 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.390
 I already told you that it is that you miss the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.709
 time the ball try it because they are going to 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.000
 waste your time I just miss you 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.160
 shows in case they had any curiosity 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.780
 remember that obviously the engine is 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.920
 the back and in the part of 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.049
 ahead what is going to have is a 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.370
 trunk then they will not lose the 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.110
 I also had a night 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.150
 because I was testing it with the yes 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.340
 train and good with other vehicles like 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.590
 also the one marmoset that has the engine 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.820
 back then then the truth I lost 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.820
 enough time then so that not 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.280
 are going to waste time 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.260
 it means that I do not try with these 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.940
 vehicles try to simply do with 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.740
 vehicles that have the engine in the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.230
 good part already before finishing the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.640
 email and the trunk of the then 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.160
 there are many people who have 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.620
 asked mainly by twitter and 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.210
 by private youtube messages and how 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.440
 they make for convenient play the most 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.810
 of people know who I have problem with 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.150
 play with nobody the only thing that has to 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.670
 have obviously is conservationist 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.740
 because I do not have playstation3 then 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.480
 it's just that and being in the club 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.130
 will be on the cross at first something 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.020
 let's say club sessions and people 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.970
 can you join can you say that sometimes 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.890
 videos appear and if it's something that 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.180
 I need help soon I do not 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.650
 matter that people appear in the 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.390
 same problem if it's something I want 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.550
 show it obviously to positions 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.870
 private and a mobile and toral then it is 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.700
 So simple for people who want 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.770
 play with me also download the link 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.420
 created a description and then when a 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 big flaw go out for playstation 4 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.630
 well play with the people of playstation 4 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.820
 because as I say, I do not have 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.740
 playstation3 good as you realize already 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.720
 I opened the front of that the ader and 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.130
 as I had told you is nothing but my 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.830
 evils but you can not really do 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.800
 nothing then as I say do not try 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.629
 do it unless they want to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.490
 but because now you waste your time in 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:34.729
 all there trunk exists really not us 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.259
 it serves to store grenades then 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.550
 this I hope you have seen the video 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.550
 and see you until next time
