00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.060
 hello youtube friends 1995 and I was 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 teach how to create a server without hamas and 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.170
 they simply have to access the link 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 that I have left you in the description of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 video 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 will send us to this page www point no 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.080
 there is dotcom it will be nadal or wing it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 register and are achieved we hope some 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.130
 minutes or seconds later they go to host 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.810
 red direct 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.360
 and here is to be created from your eyes 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 the host for those who do not know is for 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.800
 replace the hamas ip 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.980
 ready and put the name on the name 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.980
 chance we are going to put a server 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.260
 I will not make it exceed the limit of 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.890
 words 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 this 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.409
 nobody has this name so it was possible 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 create ready this is the server 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.170
 Currently, he is not online 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.159
 because we need to download something a 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.299
 little program that I have left here 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 right here sorry 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.820
 let's give it to client 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:30.490
 and we downloaded the card 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.490
 we wait a few seconds, blah blah blah blah 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.189
 they give you double click blanks and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.189
 affirm next next install 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.480
 and already installed will be here the folder 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.760
 home and is here 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:02:00.670
 they give him keat after he puts the same here 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.670
 forgive her same account of the p 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.280
 let's see if you are and if it is and choose 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.200
 here he does not have p 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.200
 created here 6 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 but some seconds and everything is ok I 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 I already have a server here 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.290
 let's go here and where the ip goes here says 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.050
 where here server ip do not put anything 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.420
 because if you put for example the ip that is 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.050
 is serving nine points to another point 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.050
 Now it's going to be wrong to observe 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.050
 here 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.200
 and the server does not open let's close it 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.470
 let's enter here again and we erase 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.470
 this 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 so that other people can 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.160
 enter your server always have to 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.730
 have this here open with the ip 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.659
 selected 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.659
 and now if we open it 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.800
 ready opened 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.430
 how do I repeat this here he 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.430
 does not work for the server bukit 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.730
 add the server 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.520
 and here is my operating server 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.040
 perfect I have a bit of the record 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.500
 with the hamchi direct sorry with him 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.450
