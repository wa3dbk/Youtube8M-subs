after I did that boom it just slid right
off<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.479> thought<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.020> thing<00:01:22.080> was

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
off now I thought that this thing was

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
off now I thought that this thing was
gonna<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.890> rubber<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.909> plastic<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
gonna be like rubber or plastic but it's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.300 
gonna be like rubber or plastic but it's
actually<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.100> all

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
actually like I think it's like all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.999 
actually like I think it's like all
crystal<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.330> glass<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:28.590> don't<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
crystal or glass I don't know if it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
crystal or glass I don't know if it's
crystal<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.820> glass<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
crystal or glass but it's all of that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.520 
crystal or glass but it's all of that
all<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:35.000> it's<00:01:36.000> very<00:01:36.060> nice<00:01:36.630> very

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
all the way through it's very nice very

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.789 
all the way through it's very nice very
elegant<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.420> juice<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> awesome<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
elegant the juice in here is awesome I

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
elegant the juice in here is awesome I
think<00:01:40.829> I've<00:01:41.579> only<00:01:42.000> smelled<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.450> other<00:01:42.570> batch

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
think I've only smelled one other batch

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
think I've only smelled one other batch
besides<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.100> smells<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
besides this and this one smells like it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
besides this and this one smells like it
has<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:45.119> more<00:01:45.149> pineapple<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.979> I'm

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
has a lot more pineapple in there so I'm

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.170 
has a lot more pineapple in there so I'm
guessing<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.149> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
guessing that this would be one of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.850 
guessing that this would be one of
they're<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.140> more<00:01:49.170> pineapple

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
they're a little bit more pineapple

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.990 
they're a little bit more pineapple
heavier<00:01:50.189> batches<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.490> me

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
heavier batches because the for me

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
heavier batches because the for me
it<00:01:54.630> feels<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> pineapple<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.070> very

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it feels like the pineapple is very

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
it feels like the pineapple is very
pronounced<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.329> batch<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
pronounced on this batch and there you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.289 
pronounced on this batch and there you
go<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.259> there's<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.299> Creed's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
go there you have it there's the Creed's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.459 
go there you have it there's the Creed's
Aventis<00:02:03.869> 17<00:02:04.409> ounce<00:02:04.619> flat<00:02:04.979> cone<00:02:06.200> going<00:02:07.200> for

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
Aventis 17 ounce flat cone going for

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.740 
Aventis 17 ounce flat cone going for
right<00:02:07.680> now<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> believe<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.899> 675<00:02:11.750> better-off

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
right now I believe it's 675 better-off

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.790 
right now I believe it's 675 better-off
1/2<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.620> we

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
1/2 so we

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.850 
1/2 so we
somebody<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.900> save<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> lot<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.170> money<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.650> way
