00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.420 

future<00:04:11.230> if<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.560> made<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.740> mistake<00:04:11.950> were<00:04:12.280> just

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
future if you made a mistake were just

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.130 
future if you made a mistake were just
standing<00:04:12.730> at<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.420> first<00:04:13.750> tower<00:04:14.080> because<00:04:14.910> Vlad

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
standing at the first tower because Vlad

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.060 
standing at the first tower because Vlad
his<00:04:17.140> sanguine<00:04:17.710> pool<00:04:17.740> is<00:04:19.500> very<00:04:20.500> good<00:04:20.739> for<00:04:20.860> tower

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
his sanguine pool is very good for tower

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.440 
his sanguine pool is very good for tower
drive<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.770> pulled<00:04:23.770> off<00:04:23.920> the<00:04:24.220> next<00:04:25.210> kill

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450
