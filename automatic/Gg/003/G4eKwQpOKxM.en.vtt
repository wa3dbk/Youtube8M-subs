and<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.810> they<00:01:27.810> don't<00:01:28.909> prepare<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.180> food<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and if they don't prepare the food in a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.010 
and if they don't prepare the food in a
way<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.229> reduces<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.860> phytic<00:01:32.220> acid<00:01:33.020> they

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
way that reduces the phytic acid they

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
way that reduces the phytic acid they
may<00:01:34.320> end<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.770> deficient<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.460> those<00:01:35.700> minerals

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
may end up deficient in those minerals

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710 
may end up deficient in those minerals
so<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.909> increasingly<00:01:38.909> researchers<00:01:39.570> have

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so but increasingly researchers have

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.450 
so but increasingly researchers have
found<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.020> there's<00:01:40.259> actually<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> benefit<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
found that there's actually a benefit to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
found that there's actually a benefit to
phytic<00:01:41.790> acid<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> an<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
phytic acid and that is that it is an it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.600 
phytic acid and that is that it is an it
has<00:01:43.890> antioxidant<00:01:44.850> qualities<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
has antioxidant qualities now so the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
has antioxidant qualities now so the
question<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> good<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.659> bad<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
question is is it good or bad and the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.889 
question is is it good or bad and the
answer<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:49.890> depends<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.540> are

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
answer is it really depends if you are

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.760 
answer is it really depends if you are
somebody<00:01:52.590> who<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.159> deficient<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.060> iron<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
somebody who is deficient in iron and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.260 
somebody who is deficient in iron and
you<00:01:55.770> follow<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.130> plant-based<00:01:56.549> diet<00:01:56.790> in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you follow a plant-based diet in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.899 
you follow a plant-based diet in
particular<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.950> need<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.729> pay

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
particular you really need to pay

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
particular you really need to pay
attention<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.780> cooking<00:02:01.170> strategies

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
attention to the cooking strategies

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.280 
attention to the cooking strategies
you're<00:02:02.100> using<00:02:02.299> because<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.659> absorb<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you're using because you can absorb a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.130 
you're using because you can absorb a
lot<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:05.180> nutrients<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.390> those<00:02:06.600> plant-based

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
lot more nutrients in those plant-based

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.510 
lot more nutrients in those plant-based
foods<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.729> reduce<00:02:09.060> phytic<00:02:09.450> acid<00:02:10.250> but<00:02:11.250> for

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
foods if you reduce phytic acid but for

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.860 
foods if you reduce phytic acid but for
instance<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:12.480> high<00:02:12.690> in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
instance what if you're really high in

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.580 
instance what if you're really high in
iron

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
iron

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.309 
iron
and<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.580> don't<00:02:14.910> need<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.239> be<00:02:15.569> absorbing<00:02:16.110> more

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and you don't need to be absorbing more

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.040 
and you don't need to be absorbing more
iron<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.280> grains<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:17.940> eating

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
iron in the grains that you're eating

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.550 
iron in the grains that you're eating
in<00:02:19.170> fact<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.040> iron<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.959> hurting<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
in fact the iron is is is hurting you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.890 
in fact the iron is is is hurting you
okay<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.410> want<00:02:25.680> phytic<00:02:26.040> acid<00:02:26.190> alright

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
okay then you want phytic acid alright

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
okay then you want phytic acid alright
but<00:02:27.900> also<00:02:28.790> phytic<00:02:29.790> acid<00:02:29.940> inhibits<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:31.910> number

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
but also phytic acid inhibits a number

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.839 
but also phytic acid inhibits a number
of<00:02:33.150> metals<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.349> might<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.160> implicated<00:02:35.730> in

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
of metals that might be implicated in

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.220 
of metals that might be implicated in
certain<00:02:36.239> cancers<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.310> might

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
certain cancers and it actually might

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.380 
certain cancers and it actually might
have<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.290> positive<00:02:40.830> role<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.069> in<00:02:41.610> colon<00:02:42.060> cancer

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
have a positive role in in colon cancer

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.509 
have a positive role in in colon cancer
it<00:02:42.480> might<00:02:42.599> prevent<00:02:42.930> colon<00:02:43.230> cancer<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.250> if

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
it might prevent colon cancer and so if

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.789 
it might prevent colon cancer and so if
you're<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.819> risk<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.090> colon<00:02:45.450> cancer<00:02:45.799> maybe

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
you're at risk for colon cancer maybe

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.009 
you're at risk for colon cancer maybe
you<00:02:47.130> don't<00:02:47.940> want<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.510> again<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.900> don't

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
you don't want it and again you don't

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.979 
you don't want it and again you don't
have<00:02:49.170> certain<00:02:49.890> nutrient<00:02:50.370> deficiencies<00:02:50.989> then

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
have certain nutrient deficiencies then

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.509 
have certain nutrient deficiencies then
I<00:02:52.019> really<00:02:52.500> wouldn't<00:02:52.709> worry<00:02:52.890> about<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.220> phytic

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
I really wouldn't worry about the phytic

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.960 
I really wouldn't worry about the phytic
acid<00:02:53.640> now<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.959> might<00:02:55.170> actually<00:02:55.410> want<00:02:55.769> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
acid now you you might actually want a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.699 
acid now you you might actually want a
phytic<00:02:56.970> acid<00:02:57.060> supplement<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.530> know

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
phytic acid supplement so you know

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.039 
phytic acid supplement so you know
exactly<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.340> you're<00:02:59.459> getting<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.870> that's

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
exactly what you're getting but that's

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.390 
exactly what you're getting but that's
really<00:03:01.200> another<00:03:01.440> matter<00:03:01.709> entirely

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
really another matter entirely

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.470 
really another matter entirely
but<00:03:03.360> my<00:03:03.480> point<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:05.480> consider

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
but my point here really is consider

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.320 
but my point here really is consider
your<00:03:06.780> own<00:03:07.010> circumstances<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.880> need<00:03:09.120> more

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
your own circumstances do you need more

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.710 
your own circumstances do you need more
minerals<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.019> your<00:03:10.290> body<00:03:11.150> do<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.239> need<00:03:12.450> less

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
minerals in your body do you need less

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.259 
minerals in your body do you need less
if<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.459> need<00:03:14.640> fewer<00:03:15.299> minerals<00:03:16.670> then<00:03:17.670> maybe

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
if you need fewer minerals then maybe

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.410 
if you need fewer minerals then maybe
you<00:03:18.600> want<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.140> embrace<00:03:19.470> phytic<00:03:19.980> acid<00:03:20.070> if<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
you want to embrace phytic acid if you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.229 
you want to embrace phytic acid if you
need<00:03:21.600> more<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.079> probably<00:03:22.980> need<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.519> find<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
need more you probably need to find the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.080 
need more you probably need to find the
strategies<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.230> outline<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:26.579> will<00:03:26.790> help

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
strategies that I outline that will help

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.650 
strategies that I outline that will help
you<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.720> your<00:03:27.780> kitchen<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.940> preparing<00:03:29.940> foods

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you in your kitchen in preparing foods

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.240 
you in your kitchen in preparing foods
that<00:03:31.650> will<00:03:32.299> allow<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.600> absorb<00:03:34.260> more<00:03:35.190> of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that will allow you to absorb more of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.340 
that will allow you to absorb more of
the<00:03:35.489> minerals<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.209> them<00:03:36.480> they're<00:03:36.989> really

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the minerals in them they're really

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.979 
the minerals in them they're really
basic<00:03:37.799> techniques<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:39.090> are<00:03:39.359> all<00:03:39.569> food

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
basic techniques they are all food

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.729 
basic techniques they are all food
science-based<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:42.170> there<00:03:43.170> there<00:03:43.410> are<00:03:43.560> more

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
science-based the there there are more

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.319 
science-based the there there are more
techniques<00:03:44.220> than<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:44.760> imagine<00:03:44.850> and

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
techniques than you can imagine and

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.539 
techniques than you can imagine and
they're<00:03:45.480> actually<00:03:45.959> fairly<00:03:46.200> simple<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.920> cover

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
they're actually fairly simple and cover

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.789 
they're actually fairly simple and cover
and<00:03:47.880> they<00:03:48.030> cover<00:03:48.269> just<00:03:48.480> about<00:03:48.660> every<00:03:49.139> high

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
and they cover just about every high

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.180 
and they cover just about every high
phytic<00:03:50.700> acid<00:03:50.880> food<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.079> take<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> look<00:03:52.950> if

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
phytic acid food so take a look if

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.400 
phytic acid food so take a look if
you're<00:03:53.489> in<00:03:53.639> one<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.910> these<00:03:54.030> categories<00:03:54.720> of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
you're in one of these categories of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.949 
you're in one of these categories of
people<00:03:56.130> who<00:03:56.340> probably<00:03:56.910> need<00:03:57.359> more<00:03:57.569> minerals

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
people who probably need more minerals

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.620 
people who probably need more minerals
take<00:03:58.859> a<00:03:58.889> look<00:03:59.160> at<00:03:59.340> strategies<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.480> reduce

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
take a look at strategies to reduce

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.740 
take a look at strategies to reduce
phytic<00:04:01.560> acid<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.160> check<00:04:02.970> those<00:04:03.150> strategies

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
