 I hope you are very well today as 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.930
 can see I bring you a new video 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.329
 where you know you are analyzing the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.399
 What's new about them? 8.1 What are you like? 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.279
 you know it's the latest update of ios 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.290
 available this supposedly brings us 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.300
 a great correction of errors and other 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.879
 so good basically in these 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.070
 I'm going to update my iphone 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.339
 let's wait for him to vote and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 later we will be analyzing 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.400
 some of the news 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 so 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.800
 let's go to it okay first of all as 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 you are going to be watching here in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 the image I have what is my iphone already 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.420
 good connected not but in these 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.780
 moments if we enter what 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.170
 it's general adjustments update the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 software we will be watching 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 that appears to us 28.1 available here 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.690
 well we see all the improvements 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 bug fixes and others 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.290
 for reasons of space I can not 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.880
 update them via drop 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.590
 so anyway I go to 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.450
 do a full restoration in the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.620
 device 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.780
 ok good for this what you have to do 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.150
 is directly team can see I have 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.940
 well here we are going to enter the three there 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.950
 photos once being on itunes equipment 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.200
 wait for the iphone 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.299
 so well basically they are already in 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.759
 our car as you can see we have the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.220
 iphone let's go into what is the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.430
 iphone here 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.350
 and good basically first of all and 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.690
 as you already know and has repeated in 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.790
 all my videos the most advisable is 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 make a backup in case 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.390
 that you are doing with a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.370
 complete restoration of the system as 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.850
 in my case if they are going to be about a 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.850
 upgrade 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.920
 they will not lose any data according 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.860
 but it is recommended in case of 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.410
 anything that happens not then 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.720
 well I'm going to make a copy of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.330
 security in these moments of 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.650
 applications and others 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.659
 let's wait for this process 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.819
 I finished I'll put it in fast camera 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.040
 so as not to bore you with this and well 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.700
 when this child 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.700
 and we go back 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.200
 here as you can see we have already returned 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.290
 here 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.290
 and I finish what is the backup 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.290
 good 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.770
 now what is going to be done is to do the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.630
 device restoration for this 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.730
 previously downloaded video what is 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.500
 the software as you can see here what 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.910
 I have 28.1 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.500
 I'll leave the link in the 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.180
 description of where you can see it 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.000
 you in case of the color that you want 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.800
 have in this agreement format of 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.170
 Either way though there is tension the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.940
 download automatically if you do not 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.530
 they want to download it on their own 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.110
 So, good, it's going to depend on 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.900
 you come now we are going to do the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.120
 restoration now yes here in the brand 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.680
 that has a copy say the three ago 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.140
 minutes 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.870
 to do the restoration we put alt 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.390
 restore in mac sheets to restore in 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.150
 windows and this so that you leave us 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.960
 select what is directly the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:53.200
 software from your computer does not 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.200
 in this case I have it on this side 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:02.080
 I think this is good 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.080
 so we give in open 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.540
 and here as you can see it tells us that 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.940
 iTunes will erase what all the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.000
 good iphone data what makes a 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.800
 restoration then basically what 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.269
 let's do this right now 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.239
 as well 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.970
 the eggs I'm going to cut it according to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.599
 so as not to bore you and well we come back in 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.599
 just a moment 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.530
 basically here the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.200
 update as you can see in 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.630
 screen and on the iphone we will wait 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.030
 that the boot of the iphone on the other hand 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.620
 in light on and returned to us what is the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.680
 iphone here I will be accessing 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.600
 iTunes we have here directly 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.150
 the iphone back 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.280
 as you can see so 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.420
 I will quickly start what is 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.770
 the iphone 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.879
 let's restore the backup 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.620
 so I go back in a moment we have 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.710
 here how can you see what it is 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.080
 the iphone completely from factory as 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.970
 can see 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.650
 we are going to software update 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.419
 for you to see that we are in the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.759
 latest version ios 8.1 now yes so 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.880
 I will quickly restore what is 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:25.000
 my backup 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.000
 and later I come back with you 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.980
 good here as you can see basically 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.190
 and it finished the restoration process and 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.650
 we have all the data as they can 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.409
 appreciate here and well basically the 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.979
 most outstanding novelties 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:44.319
 are the following have returned what is 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.500
 on the reel what is the album of 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.650
 reel forgiveness 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.770
 has returned introduced on the iphone 6 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.210
 and 6 plus what is app that by the 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.980
 moment is only available in states 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.790
 United 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.510
 and good 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.180
 outside of that we have a large series of 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.490
 bug fixes among other things 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.560
 so this is supposed to be a version 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.500
 more stable of them I recommend them 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.529
 to install him in the event that 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.610
 you want 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.740
 prove it 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.340
 performance in theory should be better 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.620
 and I'm going to do 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.860
 a video after explaining my 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.840
 experiences with this system but by 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.070
 now it looks very promising so they 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.840
 I recommend that you install it and good 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.400
 leave me a little hand up if you have 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.040
