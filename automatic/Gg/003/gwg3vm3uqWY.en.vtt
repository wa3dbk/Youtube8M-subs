00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.550
 chips invitations my name is married I 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.830
 I heard a cry that this is my driver's 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.390
 the rights 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.500
 don't you have rights yet 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.020
 same races 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.590
 You know, I tried a lot of professions 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.610
 is it easy to remember each and 135 and not 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.120
 go off we heard them scream 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.950
 got you can take me this 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.140
 times the beach forecasters predicted 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.719
 sunny weather and abel cute 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.899
 guys I got the right well I really 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.890
 never learned to walk i hear a cry i 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:07.330
 I'll call you later 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:09.789
 so what was it you waited so long 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.880
 of this moment and so on this occasion I 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.079
 prepared you a special gift 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.079
 you are so generous 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:27.490
 you still need to collect it 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 to look like an exhaust pipe 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.039
 the fact that Barbie herself collected the car 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:38.929
 it does not bother me at all 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.640
 can she do this before 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:59.950
 just adjust the mirror and you can 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 to get under way I will never learn to drive 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:11.060
 this exhaust pipe i'm all right now to the beach 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.340
 I'm still not doing very well 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.040
 driving a car I know a great place 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.040
 for classes you can always catch a big 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.050
 Barbie 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.090
 this 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.090
 bar 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480
 why gastona but spa 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:55.700
 but I can not can or will teach me 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.700
 driving a boy is understandable 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.270
 warning reflection in the mirror can 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.270
 to be prettier than the original 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.900
 exhaust pipe
