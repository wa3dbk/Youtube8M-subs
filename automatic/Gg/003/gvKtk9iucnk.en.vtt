some<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.280> those<00:01:25.430> previous<00:01:26.120> projects<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.870> had

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
some of those previous projects that had

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.080 
some of those previous projects that had
to<00:01:27.140> be<00:01:27.260> relighting<00:01:27.800> especially<00:01:28.640> some<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
to be relighting especially some of the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.000 
to be relighting especially some of the
thunder<00:01:29.510> passes<00:01:30.020> he<00:01:30.380> done<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:30.740> San<00:01:30.890> Antonio

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and some of the other things and I think

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.690 
and some of the other things and I think
it's<00:01:35.090> great<00:01:35.690> for<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:35.990> city<00:01:36.229> of<00:01:36.320> Knoxville

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
it's great for the city of Knoxville

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.850 
it's great for the city of Knoxville
that<00:01:37.700> he<00:01:37.910> was<00:01:38.060> able<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:38.570> combine<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.620> show

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
that he was able to combine this show

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.490 
that he was able to combine this show
with<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:41.060> installation<00:01:41.750> he<00:01:41.870> did<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.080> decay<00:01:42.470> of

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
with the installation he did a decay of

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.100 
with the installation he did a decay of
a<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.820> think<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.210> makes<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.630> north<00:01:44.870> side<00:01:45.050> of

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
a and I think it makes the north side of

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.260 
a and I think it makes the north side of
the<00:01:45.290> KMA<00:01:45.770> building<00:01:46.280> look<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.640> best<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:47.120> ever

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
the KMA building look the best it's ever

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.080 
the KMA building look the best it's ever
looked<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:48.170> defines<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.830> architecture<00:01:49.460> plus

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
looked it defines the architecture plus

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.200 
looked it defines the architecture plus
it's<00:01:50.270> an<00:01:50.390> interesting<00:01:50.630> piece<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.320> see<00:01:52.210> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
it's an interesting piece to see and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.760 
it's an interesting piece to see and
especially<00:01:53.630> if<00:01:53.810> he<00:01:53.869> can<00:01:54.020> stay<00:01:54.259> in<00:01:54.410> watch<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
especially if he can stay in watch the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:19.300 
especially if he can stay in watch the
entire<00:01:55.040> cycle

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.750 

we<00:02:19.850> actually<00:02:21.069> showed<00:02:22.069> bill<00:02:22.280> quite<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.550> few
