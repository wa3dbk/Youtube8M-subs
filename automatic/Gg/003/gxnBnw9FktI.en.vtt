00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
what's up guys I'm back with another

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.940 
what's up guys I'm back with another
redstone<00:00:06.000> tutorial<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.109> today<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.500> have<00:00:07.919> my

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
redstone tutorial and today I have my

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.610 
redstone tutorial and today I have my
latest<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.940> greatest<00:00:09.000> auto<00:00:09.599> farm<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.230> by

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
latest and greatest auto farm this is by

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.640 
latest and greatest auto farm this is by
far<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.639> most<00:00:11.880> compact<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.809> probably<00:00:13.530> even

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
far the most compact and probably even

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
far the most compact and probably even
the<00:00:13.889> fastest<00:00:14.400> farm<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.240> designed<00:00:15.660> so

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the fastest farm that I have designed so

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.519 
the fastest farm that I have designed so
far<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.940> decided<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.750> instead<00:00:19.470> of

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
far it this one I decided to instead of

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.720 
far it this one I decided to instead of
having<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.980> pressure<00:00:20.220> plate

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
having a pressure plate

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.490 
having a pressure plate
this<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.300> will<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.510> toggled<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.769> weaver

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
this one will be toggled with a weaver

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.929 
this one will be toggled with a weaver
so<00:00:25.500> before<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.949> get<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> actual

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
so before we get on with the actual

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
so before we get on with the actual
tutorial<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.630> figured<00:00:28.230> I'd<00:00:28.380> talk<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.160> little<00:00:29.429> bit

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
tutorial I figured I'd talk a little bit

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.490 
tutorial I figured I'd talk a little bit
about<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.090> farm<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> would

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
about this farm this is what I would

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
about this farm this is what I would
call<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:32.009> ambidextrous<00:00:32.759> design<00:00:32.790> meaning<00:00:33.660> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
call an ambidextrous design meaning that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
call an ambidextrous design meaning that
it<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.230> very<00:00:34.680> very<00:00:35.160> easily<00:00:35.399> mirrored<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.630> if

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it is very very easily mirrored so if

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
it is very very easily mirrored so if
you<00:00:36.840> feel<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.200> having<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.710> output<00:00:38.129> going

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you feel like having your output going

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
you feel like having your output going
to<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> right<00:00:38.879> instead<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> left<00:00:39.690> very

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
to the right instead of the left very

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
to the right instead of the left very
easily<00:00:40.829> done<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.879> set<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> clock<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.780> on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
easily done we just set the clock up on

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.180 
easily done we just set the clock up on
this<00:00:43.140> side<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:44.309> done<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:45.739> let's<00:00:46.739> say

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this side and you're done now let's say

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.940 
this side and you're done now let's say
you<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.480> access<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.410> nether<00:00:49.649> or

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you don't have access to the nether or

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
you don't have access to the nether or
you're<00:00:50.760> playing<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> server<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.110> don't

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you're playing on a server or just don't

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
you're playing on a server or just don't
have<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> best<00:00:52.860> computer<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.489> general<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
have the best computer in general you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.000 
have the best computer in general you
can<00:00:54.570> set<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.079> farm<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.620> run<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
can set up this farm to run with a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
can set up this farm to run with a
normal<00:00:56.460> redstone<00:00:56.910> clock<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
normal redstone clock which you can

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.240 
normal redstone clock which you can
change<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.010> delay<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.989> prevent<00:01:01.350> lag<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
change the delay on to prevent lag and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.359 
change the delay on to prevent lag and
then<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.730> change<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> input<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
then you just change the input and you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
then you just change the input and you
can<00:01:05.549> make<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.510> slow<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
can make it even go as slow as that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
can make it even go as slow as that
depending<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.010> laggy<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.820> server<00:01:09.060> or

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
depending on how laggy the server or

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.760 
depending on how laggy the server or
your<00:01:09.570> computer<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:11.960> here's<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.140> example<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
your computer is here's an example of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
your computer is here's an example of
how<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> could<00:01:14.250> set<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.820> farm<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
how you could set up this farm in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630 
how you could set up this farm in
survival<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> actual<00:01:16.740> farm<00:01:17.280> itself

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
survival I have the actual farm itself

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
survival I have the actual farm itself
over<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> hopper<00:01:18.900> system<00:01:19.320> leading

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
over here with a hopper system leading

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.969 
over here with a hopper system leading
over<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> output<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:22.560> done<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
over here to the output I have done a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
over here to the output I have done a
one<00:01:23.520> minute<00:01:23.729> test<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.420> each<00:01:24.630> crop<00:01:24.960> type<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
one minute test for each crop type and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
one minute test for each crop type and
this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.820> per<00:01:27.270> crop<00:01:27.600> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this is about what you get per crop in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
this is about what you get per crop in
about<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> minute<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.460> I've<00:01:29.640> set<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.210> bone

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
about a minute and I've set up a bone

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
about a minute and I've set up a bone
meal<00:01:30.869> input<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:32.850> fill<00:01:33.030> up

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
meal input right here which will fill up

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
meal input right here which will fill up
these<00:01:33.360> dispensers<00:01:34.049> starting<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.860> one

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
these dispensers starting with this one

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.390 
these dispensers starting with this one
then<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.200> one

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
then going to this one and then this one

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.740 
then going to this one and then this one
now<00:01:38.400> let's<00:01:38.430> fly<00:01:38.790> around<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.479> I'll<00:01:39.570> show

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
now let's fly around back and I'll show

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
now let's fly around back and I'll show
you<00:01:39.810> how<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.439> done<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you how this was done so this is the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.080 
you how this was done so this is the
bone<00:01:42.780> meal<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> very<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.700> simple

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
bone meal I just have a very very simple

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.740 
bone meal I just have a very very simple
hopper<00:01:45.509> setup<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.640> then<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
hopper setup for this then I have the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
hopper setup for this then I have the
output<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.500> into<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.159> dropper<00:01:50.610> elevator

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
output going into this dropper elevator

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.260 
output going into this dropper elevator
the<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.930> simple<00:01:52.500> comparator<00:01:53.070> clock<00:01:53.430> going

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the very simple comparator clock going

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
the very simple comparator clock going
into<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> elevator<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.290> powering<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
into the elevator and powering it and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.889 
into the elevator and powering it and
then<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> hopper<00:01:56.790> system<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.450> from<00:01:57.689> there

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
then a hopper system going from there

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.270 
then a hopper system going from there
into<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.649> output<00:01:58.799> chest

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
into the output chest

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
into the output chest
okay<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.730> build<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.090> farm<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:03.870> are<00:02:03.990> going

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
okay so to build this farm you are going

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.750 
okay so to build this farm you are going
to<00:02:04.470> need<00:02:04.620> these<00:02:05.100> materials<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.610> if<00:02:08.610> you're

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
to need these materials and if you're

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.090 
to need these materials and if you're
going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.180> be<00:02:09.330> building<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.560> does

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
going to be building the one that does

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.880 
going to be building the one that does
not<00:02:11.130> require<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:12.090> comparator<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.470> are<00:02:13.560> going

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
not require a comparator you are going

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.500 
not require a comparator you are going
to<00:02:14.040> need<00:02:14.190> these<00:02:14.400> materials<00:02:16.760> okay<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.330> build

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to need these materials okay so to build

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.000 
to need these materials okay so to build
this<00:02:18.660> farm<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.170> first<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.620> you're<00:02:19.770> going

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
this farm the first thing you're going

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.530 
this farm the first thing you're going
to<00:02:20.100> want<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.490> do<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.730> figure<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.120> where<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
to want to do is figure out where you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.290 
to want to do is figure out where you
want<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.960> stand<00:02:22.290> while<00:02:22.620> farming<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.910> let's<00:02:24.090> say

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
want to stand while farming so let's say

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.970 
want to stand while farming so let's say
it<00:02:24.450> was<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.780> block<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:25.470> you're<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it was this block now you're going to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.700 
it was this block now you're going to
dig<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> pattern<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:31.440> from

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
dig out a pattern like this and now from

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.550 
dig out a pattern like this and now from
here<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:32.730> will<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.360> output<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.530> you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
here this will be your output so you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.440 
here this will be your output so you
just<00:02:34.830> hold<00:02:35.250> shift<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.910> make<00:02:36.030> sure<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
just hold shift and make sure the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.290 
just hold shift and make sure the
hoppers<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:37.020> pointing<00:02:37.440> into<00:02:37.740> each<00:02:37.860> other<00:02:38.300> now

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
hoppers are pointing into each other now

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.270 
hoppers are pointing into each other now
you<00:02:39.360> place<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.200> comparator<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.960> with<00:02:43.280> hoppers

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
you place a comparator here with hoppers

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.780 
you place a comparator here with hoppers
creating<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.210> clock<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.610> make<00:02:47.610> sure

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
creating a clock like this make sure

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.940 
creating a clock like this make sure
they're<00:02:47.970> facing<00:02:48.180> into<00:02:48.570> each<00:02:48.660> other<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
they're facing into each other and you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.400 
they're facing into each other and you
can<00:02:50.130> place<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:51.030> any<00:02:51.270> miscellaneous<00:02:51.959> item<00:02:52.290> in

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
can place just any miscellaneous item in

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.990 
can place just any miscellaneous item in
there<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.770> can<00:02:52.920> see<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.370> will<00:02:53.550> start<00:02:53.580> to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
there and you can see it will start to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.570 
there and you can see it will start to
pulse<00:02:54.560> place<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> block<00:02:55.950> here<00:02:56.660> your<00:02:57.660> lever<00:02:58.580> now

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
pulse place a block here your lever now

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.199 
pulse place a block here your lever now
you<00:02:59.940> want<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.240> place<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.810> torch<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
you want to place a torch here with a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.720 
you want to place a torch here with a
block<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:05.090> then<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> block<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:07.910> torch<00:03:09.260> torch

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
block and then a block here torch torch

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.220 
block and then a block here torch torch
then<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.940> want<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.270> place<00:03:12.510> blocks<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.620> this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
then you want to place blocks like this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.930 
then you want to place blocks like this
whoops<00:03:16.940> okay<00:03:17.940> then<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.870> put<00:03:19.220> redstone<00:03:20.220> just

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
whoops okay then you put redstone just

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.420 
whoops okay then you put redstone just
on<00:03:21.090> top<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.480> those<00:03:22.850> place<00:03:23.850> your<00:03:24.090> sticky<00:03:24.480> piston
