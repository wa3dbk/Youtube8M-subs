00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
recorded this on Xbox 360 because this

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650 
recorded this on Xbox 360 because this
involves<00:00:17.279> finding<00:00:17.490> gang<00:00:17.880> vehicles<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.570> those

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
involves finding gang vehicles and those

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.330 
involves finding gang vehicles and those
are<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> lot<00:00:19.199> easier<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.740> find<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.100> old

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
are a lot easier to find on old

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.759 
are a lot easier to find on old
generation<00:00:20.910> consoles<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:22.140> don't<00:00:22.199> believe

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
generation consoles and I don't believe

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.410 
generation consoles and I don't believe
this<00:00:22.949> vehicle<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.430> storable<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this vehicle is storable the way it is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.939 
this vehicle is storable the way it is
with<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.720> windows<00:00:25.050> rolled<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
with this windows rolled up like that I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.859 
with this windows rolled up like that I
have<00:00:26.189> seen<00:00:26.430> other<00:00:26.670> users<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.449> them<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.720> their

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
have seen other users have them in their

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.390 
have seen other users have them in their
garage<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> windows<00:00:28.650> rolled<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:28.949> but

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
garage with the windows rolled up but

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.769 
garage with the windows rolled up but
that<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> long<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.300> ago<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> think

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that was a long time ago and I think

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
that was a long time ago and I think
they've<00:00:31.019> patched<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.590> since<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.790> I'll

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
they've patched it since then but I'll

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.950 
they've patched it since then but I'll
talk<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.360> later

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
talk about that later

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.330 
talk about that later
so<00:00:34.079> anyways<00:00:34.500> there<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:34.980> different

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
so anyways there are two different

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.590 
so anyways there are two different
vehicles<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> windows

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
vehicles that can have the windows

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479 
vehicles that can have the windows
rolled<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.950> paio<00:00:38.160> day

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
rolled up just like this the paio day

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.950 
rolled up just like this the paio day
and<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.760> manana<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> they're<00:00:39.480> both<00:00:39.600> gang

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and the manana and they're both gang

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.900 
and the manana and they're both gang
vehicles<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> guys<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.640> want<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
vehicles but if you guys really want a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.130 
vehicles but if you guys really want a
convertible<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> windows<00:00:43.020> rolled

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
convertible that has the windows rolled

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.479 
convertible that has the windows rolled
up<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.530> would<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> manana

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
up I would just go for the manana

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.799 
up I would just go for the manana
because<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> pay<00:00:45.030> ok<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> windows

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
because the pay ok with the windows

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
because the pay ok with the windows
rolled<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> lot<00:00:46.590> harder<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> find<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.489> all

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020 
the road to the intersection and then
drive<00:01:03.809> back<00:01:03.979> doing<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.309> respawn<00:01:05.640> new

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
drive back doing this will respawn new

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
drive back doing this will respawn new
vehicles<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.689> call<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> Sac<00:01:07.320> area<00:01:07.680> giving

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
vehicles in that call to Sac area giving

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
vehicles in that call to Sac area giving
you<00:01:08.130> another<00:01:08.400> chance<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.909> find<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you another chance to find one and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.910 
you another chance to find one and
you're<00:01:09.780> basically<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.409> repeat<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you're basically just gonna repeat this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
you're basically just gonna repeat this
process<00:01:11.100> until<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.820> find<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> manana<00:01:12.450> with

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
process until you find the manana with

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.280 
process until you find the manana with
the<00:01:12.750> windows

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the windows

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.230 
the windows
so<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:13.950> mananas<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:14.610> spawn<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.060> any

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
so these mananas will spawn up at any

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
so these mananas will spawn up at any
time<00:01:15.509> during<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> day<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.380> night<00:01:16.409> although

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
time during the day or night although

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.499 
time during the day or night although
they<00:01:17.280> usually<00:01:17.490> spawn<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> late

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they usually spawn up in the late

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
they usually spawn up in the late
evening<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.049> night<00:01:19.290> hours<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> can't

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
evening and night hours but you can't

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
evening and night hours but you can't
get<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> day<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.180> well<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.840> look

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
get them in the day as well so just look

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
get them in the day as well so just look
at<00:01:22.110> any<00:01:22.320> time<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:22.860> vehicles<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> if

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
at any time for these vehicles and if

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
at any time for these vehicles and if
you<00:01:24.270> end<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.509> finding<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.960> without<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you end up finding one without the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.630 
you end up finding one without the
windows<00:01:25.710> rolled<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.549> I'm

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
windows rolled up like the one I'm

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
windows rolled up like the one I'm
driving<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.420> pick<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.259> use

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
driving right here pick it up and use

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.600 
driving right here pick it up and use
that<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.950> drive<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that and just drive around in that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.039 
that and just drive around in that
because<00:01:30.000> that'll<00:01:30.270> increase<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> chances

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
because that'll increase the chances

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
because that'll increase the chances
that<00:01:31.110> minyak<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> spawn<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.729> if

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that minyak to spawn up down here and if

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
that minyak to spawn up down here and if
you're<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.840> lobby<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> long<00:01:34.590> time<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you're in one lobby for a long time and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.109 
you're in one lobby for a long time and
you're<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.369> getting<00:01:35.520> any<00:01:35.790> gang

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you're just not getting any gang

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.789 
you're just not getting any gang
vehicles<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> spawn<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.290> been<00:01:37.409> 20<00:01:37.770> or

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
vehicles to spawn up and it's been 20 or

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
vehicles to spawn up and it's been 20 or
25<00:01:38.310> minutes<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.790> would<00:01:39.090> hit<00:01:39.210> find<00:01:39.509> new<00:01:39.659> session

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
25 minutes I would hit find new session

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.240 
25 minutes I would hit find new session
and<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.350> start<00:01:40.530> looking<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> different

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and just start looking in a different

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
and just start looking in a different
session<00:01:41.430> sometimes<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.180> will<00:01:42.299> help<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.170> as

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
session sometimes this will help so as

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
session sometimes this will help so as
you<00:01:43.409> guys<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> screen<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.549> found

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you guys can see on the screen I found

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
you guys can see on the screen I found
my<00:01:45.000> manana<00:01:45.420> after<00:01:45.780> about<00:01:45.960> 25<00:01:46.470> minutes<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
my manana after about 25 minutes and I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
my manana after about 25 minutes and I
found<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.399> nighttime<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.030> here's<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
found it at nighttime and here's the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.719 
found it at nighttime and here's the
tricky<00:01:48.990> part<00:01:49.020> when<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> manana<00:01:50.189> spawn<00:01:50.579> up

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
tricky part when the manana spawn up

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.889 
tricky part when the manana spawn up
there's<00:01:51.000> usually<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.360> bunch<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> gangsters

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
there's usually a bunch of gangsters

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.660 
there's usually a bunch of gangsters
down<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.890> shoot<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
down here that will shoot at you if you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.319 
down here that will shoot at you if you
take<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
take it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.030 
take it
but<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.869> mananas<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.500> usually<00:01:55.680> either

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
but these mananas will usually either

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
but these mananas will usually either
spawn<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.640> somebody<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> driver's<00:01:57.570> seat

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
spawn with somebody in the driver's seat

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
spawn with somebody in the driver's seat
or<00:01:57.899> somebody<00:01:58.290> getting<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> vehicle<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
or somebody getting into the vehicle to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
or somebody getting into the vehicle to
drive<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> away<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:00.509> you're<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.990> is
