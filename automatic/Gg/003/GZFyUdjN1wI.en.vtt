00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.520 
now I love the formula of these because
they<00:03:39.910> are<00:03:40.030> not<00:03:40.240> as<00:03:40.390> drying<00:03:40.810> as<00:03:41.260> other

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
they are not as drying as other

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
sort of set to more of a tacky finish

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.810 
sort of set to more of a tacky finish
they're<00:03:47.050> not<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.410> set<00:03:47.620> up<00:03:47.740> 100%<00:03:48.340> in

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820

they're not going to set up 100% in
place<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.510> because<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.950> aren't

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
place and because of that you aren't

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.130 
place and because of that you aren't
going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.490> have<00:03:51.640> as<00:03:51.880> drying<00:03:52.300> a<00:03:52.630> formula

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
do have to be careful that you sort of

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.090 
do have to be careful that you sort of
make<00:04:09.820> sure<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.720> get<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.140> excess<00:04:11.620> out<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:11.980> that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
make sure you get the excess out of that

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.740 
make sure you get the excess out of that
area<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.580> they<00:04:12.670> don't<00:04:12.820> get<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.090> your<00:04:13.120> teeth<00:04:13.510> and

also when you eat or drink you're going

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.610 
also when you eat or drink you're going
to<00:04:15.940> need<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.239> reapply<00:04:16.630> them<00:04:16.959> they<00:04:17.200> aren't<00:04:17.530> as
