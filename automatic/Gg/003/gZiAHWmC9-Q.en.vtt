00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.249
 dance and sing against the good ones 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.199
 three weeks before the premiere of the musical Dance of the Vampires in Oberhausen 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.659
 Duration rehearsals for stage construction 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.449
 The bloodsuckers certainly have some in mind 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.420
 the staging 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.669
 for others, the special appointment for a dentist is still to come 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.589
 if you want to talk later and not conjure up the harmony, but the harmony 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.770
 The dental technicians from Duisburg have not experienced that either 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.250
 Outside appointment for the impressions the time for a visit to the Kaiserberg Clinic 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.280
 would have thrown the rehearsal plan finally over the pile 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.370
 So Maria Bender was biting into the crowd everything for the bloody 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 Incident others already have what they need 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.100
 smart plants are changing 2 percent not at all 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.240
 si the tooth was already reached we are looking for 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.320
 Thorsten Fink where did you get the last ones from the last one? 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.500
 Appearance or elsewhere come from recent appearances from Berlin yes 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.590
 and percent that even with death now all the best we see 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.280
 even active and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.580
 4 2-fold 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 the Cologne boys speak and sing and there were rumors all day long 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 the existence 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.330
 not at all pleased. "I have not even seen the choir 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.010
 So not dancing on stage is sure to be singing 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.659
 Do you understand that yes or and, as you know, always understand thank you 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.680
 For Jan Ammann aka Count Krolock, precise pronunciation is just as indispensable 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.010
 as for everyone else 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.310
 it is best to start exercising easily 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310
 Karl 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.030
 we want 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 much higher 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 Eva Maria Binder was already expected in Berlin 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 Vampire a classic wearing parts 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.810
 different than expected 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.180
 the end of his apprenticeship 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.610
 ours I have a comparison 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.810
 than 100 years Alfa Romeo a good two weeks ago 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.689
 that one does not stop 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 and another middle broken as that is no longer then 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.059
 due and has balanced for today 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.839
 There is a need to speak very precisely about a certain entitlement 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.149
 around Easter impression on that one not too much saying 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.529
 because that's a big danger so Woltmann has numerous children in the face 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.789
 may have seen next to it more and more between Stuckenborstel and that can 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.239
 to be difficult 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.759
 one week later 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.179
 Press casserole for a world star 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.879
 Roman Polanski 40 years ago the horror comedy «Dance of the Vampires» 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.439
 turned synonymous behind the Oberhausen Musical Adoption 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.189
 On this day he wants to get an idea of ​​himself like his Oberhausener 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.569
 Team masters the tight schedule and how far the rehearsals for the premiere 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.569
 have progressed 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.329
 No 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.049
 there 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.049
 Red 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.909
 Hann 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.809
 there 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.469
 ca 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.469
 Chur 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.889
 NADA 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.479
 Harare 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.579
 Dr 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.169
 while the actors in Oberhausen continue to fall on vocals 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.139
 The experts in Duisburg are now falling for what makes the vampire a vampire 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.409
 where else to take care of implants are now also in weekend shifts 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.819
 Bloodsucker made certain 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.449
 Millimeter work is also the nasty one I know everyone on whom a horde of lisps 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.079
 The bats on the musical stage would fall back on people like 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.079
 Stefan Haastert and the AQMI Oscar 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.049
 and to be honest, I was afraid that we would not be able to handle this 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.930
 Whales are not only a track for each actor, we have as usual 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.309
 made twice 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.989
 so that during the performances one breaks 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.879
 Percent that they said immediately 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.699
 so for us that's not a lot of patients but ultimately 80 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.410
 and that we can do that in time because the target was in too 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.689
 a certain time 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.520
 that was already a challenge for us 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.009
 so 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.889
 they are all looking forward to see who they are where they are money to customers and of course 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.870
 We all love it and of course want to see it too 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.960
 now it will also be shown in the spotlight for 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.969
 also Stefan Hassler case find 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.270
 So she made sure people get stuck too 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.029
 it's different for them 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.089
 yes this is a demo the exciting it is easy to distribute in the 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:52.360
 formula 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.499
 Square longer 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.129
 It's a welcome change because I really enjoy it 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.999
 For the researchers, it may have been weeks or even weeks 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.909
 really back to fifth 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.039
 that would be very personal for me personally the effort itself is 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.110
 is also quite funny once a year 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.979
 they do not do that 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.110
 there 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.759
 Ha 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.759
 Chur 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.169
 Near 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.830
 Dr 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.830
 Dr 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:44.219
 Yes
