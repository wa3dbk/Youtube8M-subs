00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it's a bare-bones structure here in the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's a bare-bones structure here in the
interior<00:01:48.989> probably<00:01:49.500> having<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.679> lot<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.830> echo

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
interior probably having a lot of echo

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.009 
interior probably having a lot of echo
because<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.519> wood<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.209> all<00:01:51.390> cedar<00:01:51.750> wood

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:52.019 
because the wood it's all cedar wood

wider variation of this it could easily

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.449 
wider variation of this it could easily
be<00:01:56.910> insulated<00:01:57.300> with<00:01:57.569> some<00:01:57.720> foam<00:01:57.929> board<00:01:58.289> or<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
be insulated with some foam board or you

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.570 
be insulated with some foam board or you

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
and at some point in time soon I've

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.750 
and at some point in time soon I've
rewired<00:02:53.109> kind<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.650> throwaway<00:02:54.040> solar<00:02:54.489> light

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
rewired kind of a throwaway solar light

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.720 
rewired kind of a throwaway solar light
with<00:02:54.939> a<00:02:54.969> tiny<00:02:55.329> tiny<00:02:55.510> little<00:02:55.810> photovoltaic

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
with a tiny tiny little photovoltaic

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.800 
with a tiny tiny little photovoltaic
panel<00:02:57.730> that's<00:02:58.060> gonna<00:02:58.180> have<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.359> switch<00:02:58.629> I'm

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
panel that's gonna have a switch I'm

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.059 
panel that's gonna have a switch I'm
going<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.019> wire<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.379> here<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.799> have<00:02:59.859> some

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
going to wire in here so you have some

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.550 
going to wire in here so you have some
solar<00:03:00.280> lighting<00:03:00.609> at<00:03:00.989> night<00:03:01.989> as<00:03:02.319> well<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
solar lighting at night as well I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.170 
solar lighting at night as well I
figured<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.040> might<00:03:03.069> as<00:03:03.219> well<00:03:03.340> take<00:03:03.760> advantage

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
figured it might as well take advantage

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.459 
figured it might as well take advantage
of<00:03:04.299> all<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> natural<00:03:04.659> light<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:04.989> comes<00:03:05.170> in

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
of all the natural light that comes in

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.470 
of all the natural light that comes in
here<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.769> harvest<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.519> for<00:03:06.700> your<00:03:06.879> nighttime
