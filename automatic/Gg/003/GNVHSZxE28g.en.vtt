00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.139 

so<00:00:04.190> here<00:00:04.370> we<00:00:04.460> have<00:00:04.490> a<00:00:05.020> bit<00:00:06.020> bird<00:00:06.320> box<00:00:07.120> which<00:00:08.120> is

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
so here we have a bit bird box which is

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.089 
so here we have a bit bird box which is
falling<00:00:08.630> over<00:00:08.960> but<00:00:09.139> it's<00:00:09.259> full<00:00:09.530> of<00:00:09.650> bees<00:00:09.830> which

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
falling over but it's full of bees which

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.069 
falling over but it's full of bees which
is<00:00:10.249> probably<00:00:10.490> why<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.789> flight<00:00:11.539> fell<00:00:11.809> over<00:00:12.019> in

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:12.079 
is probably why the flight fell over in

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.640 
is probably why the flight fell over in
the<00:00:12.139> first<00:00:12.320> place<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:13.929> I've<00:00:14.929> take<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:15.169> side

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
the first place and I've take the side

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.630 
the first place and I've take the side
off<00:00:16.180> blowing<00:00:17.180> a<00:00:17.330> bit<00:00:17.449> of<00:00:17.570> smoke<00:00:17.869> in<00:00:18.110> there<00:00:18.640> and

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
off blowing a bit of smoke in there and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.510 
off blowing a bit of smoke in there and
as<00:00:19.790> you'll<00:00:20.090> see<00:00:20.500> it's<00:00:21.500> absolutely<00:00:22.190> full<00:00:22.490> of

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
as you'll see it's absolutely full of

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.490 
as you'll see it's absolutely full of
bees<00:00:23.920> full<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:25.310> I'm<00:00:26.020> going<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:28.000> take<00:00:29.000> up

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
bees full of I'm going to take up

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.599 
bees full of I'm going to take up
the<00:00:30.550> sides<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:32.440> pull<00:00:33.440> apart<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:33.800> comb<00:00:34.129> and

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:34.609 
the sides and pull apart the comb and

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.439 
the sides and pull apart the comb and
then<00:00:34.879> I'll<00:00:34.999> mount<00:00:35.300> them<00:00:35.570> into<00:00:35.870> frames<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.390> I

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
then I'll mount them into frames so I

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.380 
then I'll mount them into frames so I
can<00:00:38.629> put<00:00:38.780> them<00:00:38.929> in<00:00:39.019> a<00:00:39.050> hive<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.359> hopefully<00:00:41.359> I

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
can put them in a hive and hopefully I

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.559 
can put them in a hive and hopefully I
can<00:00:41.510> take<00:00:41.839> them<00:00:41.989> away<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.559> they'll<00:00:43.429> be<00:00:43.699> happy

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
can take them away and they'll be happy

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:49.689 
can take them away and they'll be happy

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.330 
stapled the stake of the plastic mesh
across<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.849> to<00:01:54.969> support<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.829> are<00:01:57.009> trim

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
across it to support it there are trim

across it to support it there are trim
off<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:59.129> trim<00:02:00.129> off<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.429> surplice<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
off this trim off the surplice and so

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.729 
off this trim off the surplice and so
that<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.579> can<00:02:06.879> then<00:02:07.179> pop<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.479> into<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:10.620> into<00:02:11.620> the

shape<00:02:52.370> them<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.880> front<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> bird<00:02:53.660> box<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
shape them in front of the bird box and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.470 
shape them in front of the bird box and
as<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.410> see<00:02:59.080> the<00:03:00.760> bees<00:03:01.760> are<00:03:01.790> running<00:03:02.360> up

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
as you can see the bees are running up

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.960 
as you can see the bees are running up
the<00:03:02.599> ramp<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:04.730> join<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.150> rest<00:03:05.330> of<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.920> colony

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the ramp to join the rest of the colony

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.150 
the ramp to join the rest of the colony
in<00:03:07.970> with<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.239> combs<00:03:11.350> one<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.620> pieces

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.690 

still<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> major<00:03:16.489> piece<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:18.250> all<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.580> can

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
still a major piece to do all of you can

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:41.559 
still a major piece to do all of you can
do<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:20.030> with<00:03:20.090> one<00:03:20.420> hand<00:03:28.180> maybe<00:03:29.180> not<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:41.420> air

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
do this with one hand maybe not the air

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:48.699 
do this with one hand maybe not the air
is<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.560> live<00:03:43.489> with<00:03:43.880> these<00:03:47.320> which<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.500> good

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
is just a live with these which is good

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.069 
is just a live with these which is good
but<00:03:49.700> they<00:03:49.880> are<00:03:49.910> heading<00:03:50.450> for<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.720> box

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.920 

just<00:03:58.079> fascinates<00:03:58.620> me<00:03:59.269> the<00:04:00.269> way<00:04:00.450> they'll<00:04:00.659> run

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
just fascinates me the way they'll run

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.239 
just fascinates me the way they'll run
up<00:04:01.079> into<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.530> box<00:04:03.079> their<00:04:04.079> house<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.379> probably

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:05.249 
up into that box their house is probably

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:12.649 
up into that box their house is probably
over<00:04:06.209> 20<00:04:06.719> hours<00:04:06.870> per<00:04:07.079> diem<00:04:11.269> unlikely<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.420> give

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
over 20 hours per diem unlikely to give

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:24.960 
over 20 hours per diem unlikely to give
them<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:15.199> it's<00:04:16.199> pretty<00:04:16.380> well

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.469 

so<00:04:25.970> what<00:04:26.090> I'll<00:04:26.240> do<00:04:26.449> is<00:04:26.479> leave<00:04:26.840> this<00:04:27.020> box<00:04:27.320> here

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
so what I'll do is leave this box here

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:35.680 
so what I'll do is leave this box here
until<00:04:29.479> receiving<00:04:30.370> just<00:04:31.370> about<00:04:32.860> sunsets<00:04:34.690> are

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
until receiving just about sunsets are

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.830 
until receiving just about sunsets are
coming<00:04:36.639> here<00:04:37.639> at<00:04:37.759> a<00:04:37.820> puff<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.150> smoke<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.660> take

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
coming here at a puff of smoke and take

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.640 
coming here at a puff of smoke and take
it<00:04:38.990> away<00:04:43.720> we'll<00:04:44.720> see<00:04:44.960> how<00:04:44.990> they<00:04:45.259> do<00:04:45.320> in<00:04:45.530> their

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
it away we'll see how they do in their

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.039 
it away we'll see how they do in their
new<00:04:45.830> location
