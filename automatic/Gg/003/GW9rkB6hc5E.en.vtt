00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.180 
makes more sense to have have your arms
in<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.030> middle<00:03:39.300> rather<00:03:39.510> than<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.110> off<00:03:40.410> one

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
in the middle rather than just off one

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.080 
in the middle rather than just off one
side<00:03:42.110> well<00:03:43.880> anyway
