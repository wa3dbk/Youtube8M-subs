 this technology an experiment 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.790
 developed by the Portuguese agency for 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.500

 lived yesterday the heat did 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.380

 Congratulations on great initiative is a 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 new technology that will solve your 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.270
 life called pixels 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.040
 it transforms the objects in a network 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.750
 that you can search for 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.790
 using an augmented reality 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.620
 the platform is composed of a sensor 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.300
 low energy and with the application you 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.480
 finds everything with an accuracy of 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.010
 incentive is no power over assad 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.660
 will also win no Nobel Prize 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.110
 to believe 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.269
 but accounts are 75 period to power 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.900
 to turn 3,600 kilometers of a car 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.189

 ride a collective or else people are 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.889
 between applications for you to do 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.889
