00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.819 
because it everything does feel tighter
it<00:01:44.970> feels<00:01:45.360> tight<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:45.990> playing<00:01:46.229> for

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it feels tight when you're playing for

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
it feels tight when you're playing for
example<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:48.149> fast<00:01:48.540> funk

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
example if you do like quite fast funk

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
example if you do like quite fast funk
lines<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.590> example<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:51.649> you're<00:01:52.649> muting

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
lines just for example and you're muting

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.249 
lines just for example and you're muting
the<00:01:53.220> mutes<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:54.180> easy<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.659> put<00:01:54.840> off<00:01:54.990> because

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the mutes are easy to put off because

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.200 
the mutes are easy to put off because
they<00:01:55.380> feel<00:01:55.649> tighter<00:01:55.950> that's<00:01:56.729> very<00:01:57.030> very

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
they feel tighter that's very very

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.230 
they feel tighter that's very very
strange<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:58.829> very<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.119> these

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
strange but it's very very good so these

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
strange but it's very very good so these
are<00:02:00.390> super<00:02:00.509> light<00:02:00.780> gauge<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> super

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
are super light gauge I want it super

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.990 
are super light gauge I want it super
light<00:02:01.860> gauge<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> wanted<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> try

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
light gauge because I just wanted to try

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
light gauge because I just wanted to try
out<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.590> how<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.070> with

they still sound really bright and nice
and<00:03:18.329> it's<00:03:18.630> good<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.019> was<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> put<00:03:19.650> this

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
and it's good I was going to put this

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.580 
and it's good I was going to put this
through<00:03:19.889> my<00:03:20.010> fix<00:03:21.049> but<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.200> kind<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.380> figured

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
through my fix but just kind of figured

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.289 
through my fix but just kind of figured
there's<00:03:23.160> no<00:03:23.280> point<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:23.639> really<00:03:23.819> trying<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.209> get

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
there's no point in really trying to get

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.180 
there's no point in really trying to get
a<00:03:24.359> sound<00:03:24.600> across<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.200> mean<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.620> could<00:03:25.739> be<00:03:25.769> it

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
a sound across I mean it could be it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.710 
a sound across I mean it could be it
could<00:03:26.250> be<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.579> fact<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.850> your<00:03:27.060> strings<00:03:27.540> as

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
could be the fact that your strings as

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.930 
could be the fact that your strings as
the<00:03:27.840> strings<00:03:28.230> are<00:03:28.319> still<00:03:28.500> bright<00:03:28.739> or<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.760> base

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
the strings are still bright or the base

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.270 
the strings are still bright or the base
itself<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.739> there's<00:03:31.739> no<00:03:31.829> point<00:03:32.099> in<00:03:32.190> really

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
itself and there's no point in really

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.039 
itself and there's no point in really
doing<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:33.000> could<00:03:33.150> only<00:03:33.299> really<00:03:33.540> go<00:03:33.780> on

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
doing that you could only really go on

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:52.110 
doing that you could only really go on
my<00:03:34.230> word<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:36.060> I'm<00:03:36.239> going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> try<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> few<00:03:36.930> things
