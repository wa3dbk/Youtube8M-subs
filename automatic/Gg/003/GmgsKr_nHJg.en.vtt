central quest is for meaning because the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.290 
central quest is for meaning because the
more<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.700> learn<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.240> see<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:34.220> more<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:36.090> will

precedes understanding and that's why we

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.360 
precedes understanding and that's why we
often<00:03:46.710> hear<00:03:47.130> some<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.460> us<00:03:47.700> say<00:03:48.860> but<00:03:49.860> we<00:03:50.010> do<00:03:50.190> not

how<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.530> observe<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.640> that's<00:04:18.270> why<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.570> had<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
how to observe and that's why I had a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.039 
how to observe and that's why I had a
limitation<00:04:19.940> every<00:04:20.940> time<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.209> come<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.660> the

but<00:04:28.900> interpretation<00:04:30.550> involves<00:04:31.550> learning<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
but interpretation involves learning to

ask the right questions

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.890 
ask the right questions
I<00:04:42.040> find<00:04:43.040> that<00:04:43.160> oftentimes<00:04:43.550> as<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> teacher<00:04:44.570> my

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
I find that oftentimes as a teacher my

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.710 
I find that oftentimes as a teacher my
students<00:04:45.410> do<00:04:45.590> not<00:04:45.830> take<00:04:46.330> enough<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.510> their

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
students do not take enough of their

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.040 
students do not take enough of their
life<00:04:49.600> to<00:04:50.600> ask<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.170> penetrating<00:04:51.740> questions
