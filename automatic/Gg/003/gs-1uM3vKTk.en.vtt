00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.970
 www. because the exhibitor cited 3 giraudo and moggi had a vote 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.679
 I would say that 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.659
 it's quite eloquent 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:28.560
 but then 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 it's a pleasure to do a turate well let's say that in what's on tonight on ebay 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.990
 I have to declare 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.130
 and we say that ends here in this sea and land, under the date evil 5 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.510
 October 2004 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.080
 the ends after they have spoken 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.690
 london moggi giraudo speak of talking with shrimp that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.229
 TV programs to receive 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.580
 and who instead me 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.280
 but he talked with other people and then right about the people of the day 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.470
 twin tower 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.489
 one year of us we have via gabetti elegant clothes is a personaggione 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.440
 at a certain weight in the recollection of human juventus 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.560
 is a very close-knit character lamb family 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.759
 you can put it 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.779
 the point at the end of umberto faithful political burden of loading those days into 

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:16.939
 which I can put it between them two they say berger you can't go on 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.200
 so why us 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.100
 somehow we feel caught up in it or centers 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.900

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.329
 bigon giraudo 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.619
 yes, but I want you to ask me if I won't get out of them but here 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.550
 need 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.490

 giraudo the project is what I told you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.289
 you never go out that way is fine 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.800
 giraudo must live well, try to say less worse 2 years from 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.240
 this deleted icon two years from 2004 is the year remember that you will remember of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.060
 me characters were goals and percentages of the deeds of deontology 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 adopted giraudo 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.820
 every year 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.680

 limoncino just joined chiatarra giraudo 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.470
 however, as the blood is not love, in my opinion the family did not like it 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.439
 lambs the arrangement with Gaddafi was not the family's uncomfortable characters who 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.139
 they were a little tight 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.509
 arming wolf 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.519

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.119

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:40.419

 found some more 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.600
 very funny mistake I know for example 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.920
 paper cutter cutting instead of payment

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.419
 I have described the willow not Riccardo Celine instead of Riccardo Calleri 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.279
 but I imagine 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.979
 that if there are so many errors in these names it is not known to the world 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.080

 how many other transcription errors have been made on words that we cannot 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.860
 know that they are wrong because while there is a surname here that in 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.360
 somehow but certainly certainly the confusion was made 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.449
 we know very well that it is calciopoli 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.139
