00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.509
 I am twice alex core 102ex is with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.460
 another unboxing of the pre-order 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.340
 box of bioshock infinite yes what you guys 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 for five euros for example at media 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.920
 can buy later at the market 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 right game example addition 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 unlock content 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.900
 the unboxing you look for a small 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.900
 cut 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.010
 so people now it goes on with the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.379
 actual unboxing of bioshock 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.399
 infinite 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.710
 I have the whole course not 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.519
 Unwrapped we will do it all now 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.320
 but I'm not sure 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.640
 I'm even more against a code 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.150
 Jump like any preorder 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 box is the one I ever had 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:05.979
 who the very short time that here 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:09.630
 So here can only see the case like that 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.630
 only I would check for a short time 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 I can show that, too, if you 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:22.600
 the cover opens by bioshock infinite 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 you do not stand more than that here and 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 you can still see what you are for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.470
 If you guys get that extra 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.070
 presented for example for example 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.450
 now here 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.220
 master 50 levels full of industrial 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.009
 chain reaction got in the objects for 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.780
 bioshock infinite and for more infos 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.970
 at www porter.com so you get 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.709
 already additional content on the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.709
 back you can see the following 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:00.489
 ok so on the back you see 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.140
 follow the instructions how you do that 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.119
 We can redeem all here 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.390
 but still couple a bit before 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.830
 because to see the code 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.200
 that would be the way we do that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.540
 Of course you'll rub that on then 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 guarantee for this five euro 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 presented packet has lost that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.810
 of course, is clearly yes otherwise 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.810
 I would say it was the first time for 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.709
 this unboxing i hope it has you 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.680
 still liked 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.680
 until next time next gamer 032 ex 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.680
