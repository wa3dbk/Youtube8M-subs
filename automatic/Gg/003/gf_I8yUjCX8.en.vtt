is the H 340 from Ace or a very very

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.349 
is the H 340 from Ace or a very very
nice<00:00:18.800> 4<00:00:19.800> bay<00:00:20.070> Windows<00:00:20.580> Home<00:00:20.789> Server<00:00:20.820> based

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
network attached storage device looks

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.240 
network attached storage device looks
really<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.710> nice<00:00:25.920> great

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
really really really nice great

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.790 
really really really nice great
performance<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:27.449> tested<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
performance actually tested it to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.349 
performance actually tested it to
transferring<00:00:29.160> hundred<00:00:29.429> megabyte<00:00:29.730> files<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
transferring hundred megabyte files and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
transferring hundred megabyte files and
it<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.510> getting<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:30.990> 10.5<00:00:31.949> megabytes<00:00:32.399> per

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it was getting about 10.5 megabytes per

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.100 
it was getting about 10.5 megabytes per
second<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.030> throughput<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.600> very<00:00:33.840> fast

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
second of throughput so that's very fast

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.229 
second of throughput so that's very fast
and<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.380> over<00:00:34.530> Gigabit<00:00:35.010> Ethernet<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:36.090> it's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and that's over Gigabit Ethernet so it's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.750 
and that's over Gigabit Ethernet so it's
a<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.540> quick<00:00:37.040> network<00:00:38.040> cache<00:00:38.160> server<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a very quick network cache server it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
a very quick network cache server it
also<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.390> included<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
also has included in it so you don't to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.150 
also has included in it so you don't to
buy<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:42.270> terabyte<00:00:42.480> hard<00:00:42.870> drive<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
buy it a one terabyte hard drive now you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.150 
buy it a one terabyte hard drive now you
see<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.960> terabyte<00:00:46.200> Western

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
see here this is a one terabyte Western

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.240 
see here this is a one terabyte Western
Digital<00:00:47.280> green<00:00:47.670> drive<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.300> 5400<00:00:48.809> rpm

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
Digital green drive it's a 5400 rpm

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
Digital green drive it's a 5400 rpm
supposedly<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.329> has<00:00:51.420> features<00:00:51.719> 8

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
supposedly and it has features 8

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
supposedly and it has features 8
megabytes<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> cache<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.579> already

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
megabytes of cache so you do already

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.569 
megabytes of cache so you do already
come<00:00:54.180> pre-loaded<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.860> terabyte<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
come pre-loaded with one terabyte of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
come pre-loaded with one terabyte of
storage<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.020> have

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
storage but as you can see you have

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.099 
storage but as you can see you have
space<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.620> three<00:00:59.219> more<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.510> said<00:01:00.780> 4

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
space for three more now they said 4

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
space for three more now they said 4
terabytes<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> maximum<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> reality

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
terabytes is the maximum but in reality

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
terabytes is the maximum but in reality
if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> were<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.930> populate<00:01:04.470> those<00:01:04.650> Bay's<00:01:04.949> with

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
if you were to populate those Bay's with

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
if you were to populate those Bay's with
2<00:01:05.820> terabyte<00:01:06.210> drives<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> would<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.810> 8

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
2 terabyte drives you would have 8

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.710 
2 terabyte drives you would have 8
terabytes<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:08.070> storage<00:01:08.400> which<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> turn<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
terabytes of storage which I turn you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.670 
terabytes of storage which I turn you
could<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> mirrored<00:01:12.090> raid

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
could make a you know a mirrored raid

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
could make a you know a mirrored raid
array<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.460> 4<00:01:14.760> terabytes

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
array and actually have 4 terabytes

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
array and actually have 4 terabytes
redundantly<00:01:15.720> backed<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.500> would

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
redundantly backed up and that would

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
redundantly backed up and that would
give<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.830> some<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.880> assurance

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
give you some some really good assurance

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
you can transfer files off of here you

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.440 
you can transfer files off of here you
also<00:04:32.620> have<00:04:32.710> 4<00:04:33.040> USB<00:04:33.160> 2.0<00:04:33.790> ports<00:04:34.090> again<00:04:34.300> those

also have 4 USB 2.0 ports again those

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.420 
also have 4 USB 2.0 ports again those
can<00:04:34.600> be<00:04:34.690> used<00:04:34.870> all<00:04:35.440> again<00:04:35.770> for<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.010> same<00:04:36.190> thing

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
can be used all again for the same thing

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.060 
can be used all again for the same thing
you<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.700> do<00:04:36.790> print<00:04:37.030> server<00:04:37.270> sharing<00:04:38.040> you<00:04:39.040> can

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
you can do print server sharing you can

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.710 
you can do print server sharing you can
also<00:04:39.280> take<00:04:39.580> files<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.120> folders<00:04:40.360> off<00:04:40.510> here<00:04:40.690> you

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
also take files and folders off here you

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.840 
also take files and folders off here you
can<00:04:40.900> add<00:04:41.080> extra<00:04:41.560> external<00:04:42.250> storage<00:04:42.520> pretty

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
can add extra external storage pretty

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.190 
can add extra external storage pretty
much<00:04:42.970> up<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.360> what<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:43.510> want<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.870> do<00:04:43.990> and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
much up to you what you want to do and

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.170 
much up to you what you want to do and
then<00:04:44.500> finally<00:04:44.860> this<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.040> your<00:04:45.130> 10<00:04:45.220> 100<00:04:45.700> 1000

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
then finally this is your 10 100 1000

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.090 
then finally this is your 10 100 1000
Ethernet<00:04:46.600> line<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.560> do<00:04:47.680> have<00:04:47.710> Gigabit

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
Ethernet line so you do have Gigabit

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.400 
Ethernet line so you do have Gigabit
Ethernet<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:48.970> will<00:04:49.090> provide<00:04:49.410> 1,000

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
Ethernet and that will provide 1,000

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.500 
Ethernet and that will provide 1,000
megabit<00:04:50.920> per<00:04:50.950> second<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.430> throughput<00:04:51.510> right

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
megabit per second of throughput right

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.120 
megabit per second of throughput right
over<00:04:52.630> here<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:52.810> your<00:04:52.870> power<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.470> then<00:04:53.950> here's

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
over here is your power and then here's

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.590 
over here is your power and then here's
a<00:04:54.190> little<00:04:54.280> expansion<00:04:54.790> slot<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.210> think<00:04:55.450> what's

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
a little expansion slot I think what's

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.330 
a little expansion slot I think what's
in<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.840> board<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.140> a<00:04:56.170> PCI<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:56.980> maybe<00:04:57.190> you

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
in that board is a PCI so maybe you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.530 
in that board is a PCI so maybe you
could<00:04:57.520> add<00:04:57.700> something<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.360> there<00:04:58.510> but

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
could add something in there but

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.420 
could add something in there but
honestly<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.560> probably<00:04:59.680> would<00:04:59.920> recommend<00:05:00.310> it

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
honestly I probably would recommend it

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.370 
honestly I probably would recommend it
maybe<00:05:00.700> maybe<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.150> a<00:05:01.240> TV<00:05:01.570> tuner<00:05:01.750> capture<00:05:02.170> card

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
maybe maybe like a TV tuner capture card

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.360 
maybe maybe like a TV tuner capture card
if<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.530> leave<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.740> next<00:05:02.950> your<00:05:03.040> TV<00:05:03.280> to

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
if you leave this next your TV to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.770 
if you leave this next your TV to
capture<00:05:03.670> video<00:05:03.910> straight<00:05:04.090> directly<00:05:04.420> to<00:05:04.630> it

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
capture video straight directly to it

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.000 
capture video straight directly to it
but<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.320> be<00:05:05.380> honest<00:05:05.590> with<00:05:05.680> Windows<00:05:05.890> Home

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
but to be honest with Windows Home

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.640 
but to be honest with Windows Home
Server<00:05:06.040> I<00:05:06.630> wouldn't<00:05:07.630> mess<00:05:07.750> with<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.080> just<00:05:08.530> in

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
Server I wouldn't mess with it just in
