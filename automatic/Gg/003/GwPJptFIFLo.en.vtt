00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.109
 I can join you 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.680
 of course orders to my major rest 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:20.960
 you do not have to call me like 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:23.860
 andorre she is beautiful no I see her 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.860
 not enough for my taste 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.090
 I grew up on new harmony 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.279
 I went to the military school of 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:44.000
 body work I saw the earth how old 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:54.320
 adult but but it remains my homeland you 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:57.199
 are not talkative you major I imagine 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.070
 not what you feel I lost 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.159
 close but I like I've never lived this 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.060
 as you go through as a soldier 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:14.540
 our duty is to protect men 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:16.470
 at all costs you speak as if the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.040
 soldiers were not men 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 we are not machines 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 are humans 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 I leave you to your thoughts 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.880
 she said the same thing 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.659
 we are not machines 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.900
 our cares 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.959
 have allowed the galaxy to him without 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.269
 roots and where life exists the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.689
 wisdom of our long history has 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.489
 fed the soil our France is a 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:26.079
 sun dominates towards which are turning 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.060
 all the intelligences at the shelter 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.420
 impenetrable under which they could 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 blossom 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.590
 I introduce myself to myself 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.970
 accused of having insured the source of 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.330
 horrors 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:53.650
 for trying to save us that destiny 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.650
 which obliges us to use has yielded 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.550
 humanity represents a threat to the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.160
 galaxy refuse their father application 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.900
 is a serious mistake 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.819
 our scouts the darkness 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.390
 they take to triumph on their behalf 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.819
 the drillers hold the coat of 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.810
 responsibility it belongs to them 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.810
 only 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.319
 judged the arrivals to your team 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.280
 but do not doubt the reality 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.810
 the depositary is already at work 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.560
 and our executioners
