00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
with that 30 seconds and since i had

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.760 
with that 30 seconds and since i had
less<00:02:30.830> time<00:02:31.100> okay<00:02:31.550> he<00:02:32.030> tried<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.020> win<00:02:33.380> otherwise

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
less time okay he tried to win otherwise

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.720 
less time okay he tried to win otherwise
I<00:02:34.250> think<00:02:34.280> draw<00:02:35.090> their<00:02:35.420> being<00:02:35.600> logical<00:02:35.870> result

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
I think draw their being logical result

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
I think draw their being logical result
this<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.850> really<00:02:38.060> tough<00:02:38.570> start<00:02:39.050> for<00:02:39.200> you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
this is really tough start for you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.820 
this is really tough start for you
what's<00:02:39.890> gone<00:02:40.310> wrong<00:02:41.050> yeah<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.230> hard<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.650> say

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
what's gone wrong yeah it's hard to say

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.400 
what's gone wrong yeah it's hard to say
basically<00:02:43.340> okay<00:02:44.090> yesterday<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.930> messed<00:02:45.260> up

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
basically okay yesterday I messed up

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.770 
basically okay yesterday I messed up
from<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> very<00:02:46.040> beginning<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.750> today<00:02:47.750> I

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
from the very beginning and today I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.210 
from the very beginning and today I
believe<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.200> was<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.350> normal<00:02:48.470> game<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:49.070> at

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
believe it was a normal game just at

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.620 
believe it was a normal game just at
some<00:02:49.340> point<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.760> be<00:02:49.850> repeating<00:02:50.239> most<00:02:50.420> which

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
some point to be repeating most which

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.960 
some point to be repeating most which
was<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.020> decently<00:02:51.500> logical<00:02:52.040> conclusion<00:02:52.910> of

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
was the decently logical conclusion of

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.479 
was the decently logical conclusion of
the<00:02:53.120> game<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:54.590> he<00:02:54.709> deviated<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.370> way

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the game and then he deviated in a way

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.860 
the game and then he deviated in a way
which<00:02:55.670> way<00:02:55.790> which<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.090> didn't<00:02:56.360> expect<00:02:56.570> him<00:02:56.720> to

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
which way which I didn't expect him to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.620 
which way which I didn't expect him to
do<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.020> he<00:02:57.230> spent<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.709> lot<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.860> time<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:59.360> got

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
do and he spent a lot of time and I got

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.510 
do and he spent a lot of time and I got
very<00:02:59.660> optimistic<00:03:00.320> from<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.890> point<00:03:01.100> onwards

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
very optimistic from that point onwards

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.900 
very optimistic from that point onwards
and<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.320> guess<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.830> game<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.190> more<00:03:04.820> or

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
and then I guess the game was more or

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.650 
and then I guess the game was more or
less<00:03:04.940> decent<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.900> towards<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.590> end<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.540> know

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
less decent and towards the end you know

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
less decent and towards the end you know
he<00:03:08.780> kept<00:03:08.989> playing<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> seconds<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.250> I

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
he kept playing on the seconds and I I

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.250 
he kept playing on the seconds and I I
thought<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.300> was<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.660> control<00:03:11.810> because<00:03:12.140> I

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
thought I was in control because I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.259 
thought I was in control because I
thought<00:03:12.500> my<00:03:12.650> bishops<00:03:12.950> were<00:03:13.040> very<00:03:13.250> good<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.640> my

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
thought my bishops were very good and my

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.350 
thought my bishops were very good and my
king<00:03:14.450> was<00:03:14.570> not<00:03:14.690> in<00:03:14.810> danger<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.440> suddenly<00:03:15.920> I

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
king was not in danger but suddenly I

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.699 
king was not in danger but suddenly I
didn't<00:03:17.360> take<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.959> opportunity<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.350> force<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
didn't take the opportunity to force a

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.070 
didn't take the opportunity to force a
draw<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.100> move<00:03:19.820> later<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.209> find<00:03:20.420> myself<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.959> a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
draw and move later I find myself in a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.590 
draw and move later I find myself in a
very<00:03:21.709> difficult<00:03:21.950> position<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.700> suddenly<00:03:23.450> my

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
very difficult position and suddenly my

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.690 
very difficult position and suddenly my
time<00:03:23.810> also<00:03:24.320> started<00:03:24.950> ticking<00:03:25.190> down<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.610> then

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
time also started ticking down and then

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.830 
time also started ticking down and then
I<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.209> lost<00:03:27.459> do<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.550> think<00:03:28.790> because<00:03:29.630> you've

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
I I lost do you think because you've

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.050 
I I lost do you think because you've
recently<00:03:30.110> been<00:03:30.380> playing<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.340> very<00:03:31.730> strong

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
recently been playing in very strong

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.009 
recently been playing in very strong
tones<00:03:32.330> for<00:03:32.570> example<00:03:32.989> in<00:03:33.080> Norway<00:03:33.440> chess<00:03:35.019> when

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
tones for example in Norway chess when

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.960 
tones for example in Norway chess when
you're<00:03:36.140> playing<00:03:36.440> slightly<00:03:36.950> weaker<00:03:37.400> opponents

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
you're playing slightly weaker opponents

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.810 
you're playing slightly weaker opponents
do<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.450> think<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.440> perhaps<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:40.100> take<00:03:40.580> more

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
do you think that perhaps you take more

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.410 
do you think that perhaps you take more
chances<00:03:41.560> yes<00:03:42.560> certainly<00:03:42.739> I'm<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:44.239> course

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
chances yes certainly I'm of course

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.650 
chances yes certainly I'm of course
taking<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> little<00:03:44.900> bit<00:03:45.050> more<00:03:45.230> risks<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.660> but

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
taking a little bit more risks and but

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.410 
taking a little bit more risks and but
ok<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.050> kind<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.800> know<00:03:48.830> it's<00:03:49.100> not<00:03:50.090> like<00:03:50.239> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
ok it's kind of you know it's not like I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.850 
ok it's kind of you know it's not like I
can't<00:03:50.660> just<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.930> do<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.230> it's<00:03:51.380> just<00:03:51.560> part<00:03:51.770> of

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
can't just to do it it's just part of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.700 
can't just to do it it's just part of
the<00:03:51.920> game<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.670> know<00:03:52.790> when<00:03:52.940> you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
the game you know when you

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.220 
the game you know when you
to<00:03:53.890> win<00:03:54.100> from<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.580> start<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.240> get<00:03:56.050> us

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
to win from the start and you get us

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.410 
to win from the start and you get us
some<00:03:56.530> chances<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.430> open<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> long<00:03:58.150> time

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
some chances and open it is a long time

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.390 
some chances and open it is a long time
it<00:03:58.630> happens<00:03:58.930> by<00:03:59.500> itself<00:03:59.530> it's<00:04:00.010> not<00:04:00.130> really

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
it happens by itself it's not really

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.700 
it happens by itself it's not really
that<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:01.630> know<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:01.870> not<00:04:01.960> that<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.230> was<00:04:02.380> making

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
that you know it's not that I was making

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.080 
that you know it's not that I was making
decision<00:04:03.070> should<00:04:03.250> i<00:04:03.310> make<00:04:03.460> a<00:04:03.490> drawer<00:04:03.730> not<00:04:03.910> it's

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
decision should i make a drawer not it's

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.900 
decision should i make a drawer not it's
just<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.390> i<00:04:04.510> felt<00:04:04.750> i<00:04:04.930> was<00:04:04.960> better<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.560> this

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
just that i felt i was better and this

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.510 
just that i felt i was better and this
feeling<00:04:06.910> was<00:04:07.680> genuine<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.830> know<00:04:08.860> coming

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
feeling was genuine you know coming

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.120 
feeling was genuine you know coming
coming<00:04:09.970> from<00:04:10.270> from<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.690> inside<00:04:10.960> so<00:04:11.650> that's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
coming from from the inside so that's

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.380 
coming from from the inside so that's
just<00:04:12.190> how<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.550> happens<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:14.770> know<00:04:14.860> if<00:04:14.980> i'll

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
just how it happens and you know if i'll

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.600 
just how it happens and you know if i'll
keep<00:04:16.390> losing<00:04:16.840> all<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.350> games<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.739> i<00:04:18.100> will<00:04:18.430> try

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
keep losing all the games and i will try
