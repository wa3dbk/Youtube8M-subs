00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.910
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.410
 once again to my channel I am kripper and 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.660
 we are back in modern warfare 3 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.490
 this time it's the turn of the ak-47 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.919
 As you can see I am using it with 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.480
 muffler and large chargers that the 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.429
 true to be a map I'm tiny 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.800
 how can it be I do not really go well 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.599
 these two accessories and good because no 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.250
 They explained why I'm going to explain 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.439
 because it goes well in the muffler and the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 large chargers on this map because 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.250
 honestly for my game mode they are 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.880
 the best accessories that could be 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.559
 using in this game is worth the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.870
 reason for the muffler I think it's 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.160
 quite obvious that apart from to not 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.500
 appear on the map that's a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.989
 impressive advantage I also use it 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.180
 by the flash as you know the ak-47 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.770
 is a weapon that when firing good as the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.440
 fire in the flashes of light that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.210
 comes off when you press the r1 to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.680
 shoot because they are impressive not 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.600
 really sometimes does not let you see the 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.190
 enemy so that's another reason 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.870
 whereby I put on the muffler to 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.000
 that when you shoot, it really is not 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.410
 notes nothing do not come out in that flash and 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.899
 it does not bother you at the time of aiming or 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 sail to the objective and well apart from 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.140
 to not leave on the map 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.780
 the flash is another of the great 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.400
 reasons has a disadvantage that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.500
 disadvantage because he loses the reach 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.510
 what happens when you lose reach then 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 when you shoot long distance 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.090
 you lose enough damage 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.800
 there's the trick not to take a map 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.659
 in which there are no great distances by 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.120
 so you do not lose any damage and 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.560
 great advantages on all sides that 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.550
 is the reason why I have put on 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.530
 silencer on that map 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.760
 we go with the big charger because I 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.550
 I have put a large charger instead of 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.500
 have put me back or good impact 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.110
 I 'm really a player that goes a lot 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.580
 ruse'm moving all over the map I 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.619
 infiltrated directly it responds the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.020
 enemy therefore I have enough 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.790
 probability of finding me two three or 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 four face enemies therefore 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 I need a fairly extended charger 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.789
 give me the opportunity to kill 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.440
 to four enemies without needing 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.420
 waste time in recharging that's why I've 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.030
 big boot post and I think that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.259
 for me for me for this game to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 the game mode he was playing 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.539
 Well, they will be the best accessories, not 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 well let's proceed to comment a 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.780
 little fashion that I'm losing time 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.850
 explaining why I'm taking this class is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.350
 a fashion with ak-47 evidently in two 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.420
 minutes and a half 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 if you notice, I cut them all three 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 first casualties as good as they were 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.780
 quite slow and you know that I do not 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.000
 they like slow downs and I like it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.110
 climb things moved faster 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.240
 and more impressive 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.890
 and good for fashion will come or CIF 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.540
 they will give it to me right away 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.770
 Bunker is a voice as you said 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.870
 pretty fast and that I liked 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.400
 very much and I hope that you too 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.540

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.450
 next barren fashion you want me to use 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.160

 pulling fashions with almost all weapons 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.550
 I have very few truth but 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.640
