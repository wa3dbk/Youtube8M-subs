 I have taken the rest that is a file 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.580
 png without background to download something without 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.830

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.360
 the rest in point png in google and you go to 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.840
 images and there I searched is the image that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.060
 be with white squares in the background 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.780
 black and white squares I think blacks and 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.140
 grays or something like that and let's go to it I open the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 photoshop 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.319
 we open the photoshop 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.940
 if I want to accept it worth chan chan 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.000
 let's wait a moment that opens up 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.180
 is opening after trying another court 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.810
 it's worth once open let's file to 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.210
 open and now I'm going to do the inventor and 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.640
 extremen here 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.160
 here we have it now diego 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.800
 I do this file so I can be 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.000
 easier 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.120
 a moment before guys look at the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.690
 properties details and look at the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.880
 dimensions of the image 512 512 for 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.380
 that to do it go for example now here 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.380
 and I say new 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.700
 512 so that it's the same size for me 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.680
 and transparency is worth to start the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.230
 same size is now the same size 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.230
 then here I can now put 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.160
 dragon 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.600
 and so it's more or less how big it is going to 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.870
 be for me to fit in with the other 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.070
 then how is this a little big what 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.090
 I'm going to go down to 30 and it's better 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.090
 perform the layer 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.730
 and now we paste it here 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.440
 now I take this layer 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.920

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.230
