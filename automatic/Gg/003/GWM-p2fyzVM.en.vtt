00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 now everyone and I like the video I am 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.480
 seva attends the canal by swallowing books 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.730
 I'm going to make the top 10 or the top 10 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.769
 books that I read in this 2014 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 it's not really in any order or 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.450
 it is not that from the best to the worst or 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.710
 from the worst to the best but they are from books 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
 that I liked a lot and that I would like 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 name them in this video because they deserve 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 worth a book that I liked very much 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.949
 it's 2014 was under the same star of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.930
 shonn greene I think everyone read 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.650
 this book and if they did not read it they went to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.630
 see the movie or something because it was a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 book that was fashionable in June in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 July and I got sick of hearing things from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.290
 under the same star it's like 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 begins to generate a rejection until this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 book of so much fury that there was 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.059
 and of so much better star than there is in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 everywhere on the internet in the streets 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.030
 I go to small states now our 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.910
 great star aphorism was like that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.590
 well, it was already like that, we already understood 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 I read it at the end of last year and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.789
 this year I had reread it when I went to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.559
 see the movie and I liked it very much 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.760
 I think I 'll read it again not in a 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.940
 moment because I really liked the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.430
 history is 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.320
 and without a doubt they are the best readings of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.900
 this 2014 other what I liked very much 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.460
 was to run or die for hefner that is the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.250
 first part of the trilogy of meis 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.440
 runner this book is so good it 's like 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.700
 that you can not believe that James Turner 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 have such a macabre brain no no no 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.440
 macabre but a brain so like that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.390
 it seems so great the idea that there 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.600
 some guys caught and that the only 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.070
 exit is a labyrinth so I like 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.289
 too much the book besides all the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.610
 things that are happening I like the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.840
 general television but certainly the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.390
 running to die was the best of the three 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.390
 another crazy I liked too this 2014 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.340
 it was legend emery I talked it from outside in 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.140
 the group I do not know if they saw it but if not 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.460
 they saw him pretend in the book they were going to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.649
 go to the moment of europe where I speak 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.149
 of this book, the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.039
 idea this book is narrated from the point 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.319
 of view of two characters totally 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.390
 different but that are general the 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.460
 two I really like this book and I do not know 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.319
 what to say because it's like I feel 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.229
 so many things that I'm speechless 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.940
 another but great this 2014 was already 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.250
 I ended up tahar amafi which is the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.670
 first part the trilogy of sutter min 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.990
 this turn is also very good 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.570
 great when for the idea of how 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.040
 is written by how the book is but 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.380
 outside it's beautiful I think it's the most 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.790
 cute i have all of goodbye to this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.320
 book they also speak europe so 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.210
 squeezing in the book they will look at the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.310
 motion of the video on the cable this 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.950
 book casares shadows me celestial fire 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.140
 is the last part of the main saga 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
 of Shadowhunters because they are a 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.300
 create these are reviewed favorites and 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.830
 this book is like too much spend 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.270
 so many things things like the end of 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.300
 history have to solve the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.190
 conflict and in all the latest books 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.200
 always and deaths and these deaths are 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.290
 they stick too much the end is so good 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.239
 but so good I really liked this book 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.739
 and the saga in general I also like 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
 too much going on to create I want that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.250
 you know that I love you when I found out that 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.350
 another new trilogy of 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.000
 Shadowhunters I got super happy 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.620
 and I'm super eager to read it because 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 I do not want that casual one ends 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.920
 there will never be a Shadowhunter the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.870
 one of the best reading of this year 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.160
 she was also a mechanical princess who is the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.660
 third part of the trilogy of 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.890
 origins also written by large house of 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.630
 create this video I also like 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.920
 too much and this trilogy also 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.630
 Like very much 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.210
 this book is without a doubt the best of the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.270
 three 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.600
 a lot of things by the end all 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.130
 what goes on all over is a very book 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.690
 Well there are people who do not really like the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.000
 main saga but he really likes the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.440
 trilogy of this one so if you do not 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.240
 will like to know the main thing of not the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.980
 opportunity I do not know if it's much better but 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.410
 yes another book is very good 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 very good this 2014 was divergent by 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.310
 chronic road which is the first part the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.560
 divergent trilogy when I read this 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.840
 book could not believe that there is a book 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.840
 that is as great as it was made the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.070
 society of this world as he lifted up the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.410
 extreme 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.110
 I liked too much the only thing that did not 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.050
 like the divergent trilogy is real 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.170
 as you already know but the first book 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.000
 divergent is great is terrific progre 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.680
 I put 5 out of 5 stars because I liked it 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.140
 too much other I think I liked it too 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.180
 much of this 2014 was mockingjay that was 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.760
 a rereading to see the movie goodbye 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.810
 the first is that he had read Mockingjay not 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.250
 he has paid a lot of attention to the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.250
 details because it's like I wanted to know 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.470
 more more more more more more 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.750
 now I read it more slowly and they hit me 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.300
 much more all the things that happen the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.010
 deaths all the canis all so 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.930
 they are just even more and it made me feel 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.280
 even more and I will not get tired of 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.630
 never say that the eyes of hunger is 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.430
 my favorite trilogy of all 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.610
 times another I think I also read that it is 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.110
 great in this 2014 is the fifth wave and 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.330
 Annecy This book is about an invasion 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.460
 alien but it's like us 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.870
 we usually see the invasions 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.120
 aliens in the movies and everything 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.530
 that is, it's like they're attacking 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200
 like the extraterrestrials are 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.210
 up on a ship but it barely looks and 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.280
 they are attacking humans from different 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.169
 ways in the so-called waves in the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.150
 first wave cut all the whole 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.460
 electricity in the second wave there was a 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.200
 it's like the sea level rose in the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.180
 third wave a plague that spread 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.669
 fast and many people died 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.169
 and in the fourth wave it's like that of 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.580
 suddenly the aliens were 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.110
 in some people and you can not 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.120
 trust nobody because they could kill you 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.520
 and then this book tells you what the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.110
 fifth wave and it's a story too 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.150
 good I'm going to talk about this book in 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.950
 europe to give you more details now 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.180
 we go to the video very long but 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.590
 no doubt these the best books that 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.540
 I read this year good here the last book 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.280

 how the story of humor is narrated 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.140
 everything is like I put 5 of 5 because 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.970
