size but give you a sense of what the

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.280 
size but give you a sense of what the
soft-shell<00:00:16.520> clam<00:00:16.940> is<00:00:17.180> like<00:00:17.390> they're<00:00:17.960> not<00:00:18.110> very

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
big we have a spacer here and it's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.660 
big we have a spacer here and it's
marked<00:00:21.260> a<00:00:21.380> two<00:00:21.860> inch<00:00:22.100> mark

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
marked a two inch mark

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.820 
marked a two inch mark
so<00:00:23.000> anything<00:00:23.420> that<00:00:23.570> fits<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:23.990> here<00:00:24.170> we<00:00:24.500> have<00:00:24.680> to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
so anything that fits in here we have to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.550 
so anything that fits in here we have to
turn<00:00:24.980> back<00:00:25.010> for<00:00:25.790> conservation<00:00:26.480> purposes<00:00:26.690> so

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
turn back for conservation purposes so

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720 
turn back for conservation purposes so
we're<00:00:27.710> looking<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:28.160> those<00:00:28.280> that<00:00:28.430> are<00:00:28.580> bigger

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
we're looking for those that are bigger

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.990 
we're looking for those that are bigger

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
you can take up to 300 clams per person

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.570 
you can take up to 300 clams per person
providing<00:00:32.540> there<00:00:32.810> within<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.380> size<00:00:33.650> limit<00:00:34.070> we

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
providing there within the size limit we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.170 
providing there within the size limit we
need<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.790> figure<00:00:34.910> bucket<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.970> bigger

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
need to figure bucket so we the bigger

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.240 
need to figure bucket so we the bigger
the<00:00:38.360> hole<00:00:38.510> generally<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.380> bigger<00:00:39.560> the<00:00:39.740> clam

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
the hole generally the bigger the clam

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.850 
the hole generally the bigger the clam
so<00:00:41.150> what<00:00:41.330> we<00:00:41.480> will<00:00:41.630> be<00:00:41.690> doing<00:00:41.930> is<00:00:42.200> going<00:00:42.470> back

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
so what we will be doing is going back

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.980 
so what we will be doing is going back
behind<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.550> hole<00:00:43.730> approximately<00:00:44.540> four<00:00:44.840> to

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
behind the hole approximately four to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.720 
behind the hole approximately four to
six<00:00:45.200> inches<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.010> we're<00:00:46.160> going<00:00:46.310> to<00:00:46.340> dig<00:00:46.520> down

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
six inches and we're going to dig down

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.110 
six inches and we're going to dig down
right<00:00:47.120> straight<00:00:47.950> go<00:00:48.950> down<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:49.760> know<00:00:49.880> it's
