00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899

don't<00:05:50.899> give<00:05:51.529> me<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:52.219> white<00:05:52.550> face<00:05:52.870> sometimes

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
don't give me a white face sometimes

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.279 
don't give me a white face sometimes
give<00:05:54.560> me<00:05:54.770> I<00:05:54.949> really<00:05:55.339> don't<00:05:55.520> know<00:05:55.789> why<00:05:56.089> but<00:05:56.960> I

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
give me I really don't know why but I

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.360 
give me I really don't know why but I
think<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.310> if<00:05:59.149> this<00:05:59.810> foundation<00:06:00.560> don't<00:06:00.889> give

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
think that if this foundation don't give

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.260 
think that if this foundation don't give
a<00:06:01.669> photograph<00:06:02.629> white<00:06:03.560> cast<00:06:03.979> it's<00:06:04.339> going<00:06:04.759> to<00:06:05.029> be

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
a photograph white cast it's going to be

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.230 
a photograph white cast it's going to be
the<00:06:05.479> perfect<00:06:05.810> foundation<00:06:06.259> ever<00:06:07.240> especially

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
the perfect foundation ever especially

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.379 
the perfect foundation ever especially

because if you want a little bit

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.889
