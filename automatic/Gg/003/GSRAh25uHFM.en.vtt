time<00:00:00.240> what<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.020> want<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.319> show<00:00:01.500> today<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:04.700> how<00:00:05.700> we

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
time what I want to show today is how we

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.650 
time what I want to show today is how we
can<00:00:06.180> control<00:00:06.660> an<00:00:07.020> Arduino<00:00:07.859> microcontroller

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
can control an Arduino microcontroller

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.459 
can control an Arduino microcontroller
via<00:00:09.660> SMS<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> Arduino<00:00:12.780> now<00:00:13.410> we

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
via SMS so this is the Arduino now we

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.310 
via SMS so this is the Arduino now we

just with an SMS that says lead on or
laid<00:01:29.790> off<00:01:30.470> now<00:01:32.450> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:33.840> nice<00:01:34.259> because

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
laid off now this is very nice because

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.039 
laid off now this is very nice because
if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.939> put<00:01:36.180> instead<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> leg

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
if you put if you put instead of a leg

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.420 
if you put if you put instead of a leg
I'll<00:01:37.380> relay<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.430> electrical

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I'll relay that with the electrical

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.179 
I'll relay that with the electrical
relay<00:01:42.170> where<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.100> put<00:01:44.340> some<00:01:45.710> light<00:01:46.710> or
