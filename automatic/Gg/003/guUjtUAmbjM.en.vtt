00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
 hello today in this video I'll explain 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 very quickly and very easily how 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.360
 color a metallic color to a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 cake in this case will be the color 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.489
 silver and there is a cake in golden color 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.199
 and many of you asked me how I had 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.480
 done that purple color I explained it in my 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.650
 blog but anyway I was 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.839
 having a video so you can see what 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.370
 fast that 's the first thing we're going to 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.190
 have to do is protect all the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.589
 surfaces because you have to notice that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.720
 if you do not do it, color can 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.280
 reach any part of your 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.729
 room as it happened to me the first 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.559
 Once I used this product I did not know and 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.900
 then stain absolutely everything like that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.580
 what 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.710
 what I'm going to do is put a box 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.360
 around my guitar and apply the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.850
 strike I know it's quite logical 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.280
 but I did not fall I took the spray I started 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.430
 throwing the product is when I realized 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.380
 around me everything was all stained 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.790
 this time they were black was not even 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.490
 united silver 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.710
 but it was exaggerated I did not know that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.990
 could reach respect away too 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.660
 we are going to take into account very 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.240
 important as our cake is 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.890
 well covered with the fondant that has 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.410
 the least number of imperfections 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.840
 possible keep in mind that when you 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.180
 apply the spray any imperfection 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.680
 it's going to look a lot more for what we have 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.930
 to be very careful when it comes to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.360
 cover confuse it and leave it all 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.130
 smooth that we can once applied the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.170
 spray we have to be very careful to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.030
 the time to manipulate the cake because 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.850
 any friction can leave marks on the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.070
 cake I know it's hard to make a cake 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.830
 totally perfect without any friction without 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.170
 no type of imperfection but let's be 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.140
 a little clever and when decorating 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.270
 our doors will always place the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.800
 elements like flowers or any other 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.930
 ornament over these imperfections 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.039
 so that our try to look as 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.780
 pretty possible 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.790
 I put the cake in the box as you see 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.390
 the spray and now finally everything already 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.390
 and go putting 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.870
 here we would have the spray applied on the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.819
 cake and it's simply this is a wine 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.950
 very simple and very short I invite you to 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.900
 watch the next video where they come 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.910
 to make some express roses I call them 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.370
 well because they are very fast to make are 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.220
 simple they do not have wires are ideal 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.660
 also to decorate cupcakes thanks 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.660
 for being there and until the next video
