like girls like jelly belly but a pop

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100 
like girls like jelly belly but a pop
Grande<00:01:37.340> which<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:37.520> don't<00:01:37.580> like<00:01:37.700> I'm<00:01:38.540> scared<00:01:38.930> of

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
Grande which I don't like I'm scared of

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.140 
Grande which I don't like I'm scared of
bacon<00:01:39.500> because<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.100> hate<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.520> fake<00:01:40.760> liquid

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
bacon because I hate that fake liquid

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.370 
bacon because I hate that fake liquid
smoke<00:01:41.360> taste<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:41.870> I<00:01:41.930> feel<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.230> that's

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
smoke taste and I feel like that's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.260 
smoke taste and I feel like that's
probably<00:01:42.530> what<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:43.010> gonna<00:01:43.130> be<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.610> think<00:01:44.120> that

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
probably what it's gonna be I think that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.730 
probably what it's gonna be I think that
I<00:01:44.300> believes<00:01:44.690> have<00:01:44.810> like<00:01:44.990> candy<00:01:45.230> Bacon's<00:01:45.590> and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I believes have like candy Bacon's and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.930 
I believes have like candy Bacon's and
so<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:45.980> think<00:01:46.010> I'd<00:01:46.220> translate<00:01:46.610> well<00:01:46.730> into<00:01:46.760> a

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
so so I think I'd translate well into a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.670 
so so I think I'd translate well into a
lollipop<00:01:47.360> but<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:47.690> pizza<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.380> pizza

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
lollipop but like pizza like a pizza

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.310

lollipop<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:50.390> just<00:01:50.600> sounds<00:01:50.780> like<00:01:50.810> barf<00:01:51.050> city

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
lollipop that just sounds like barf city

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.550 
lollipop that just sounds like barf city
