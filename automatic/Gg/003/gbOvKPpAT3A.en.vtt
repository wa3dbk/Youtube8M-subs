continue<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.210> story<00:00:21.529> but<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.430> before<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.240> do

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
continue this story but but before I do

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.179 
continue this story but but before I do
that<00:00:26.269> we're<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> attempt<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.500> pull<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
that we're going to attempt to pull the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.290 
that we're going to attempt to pull the
sword<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> stone<00:00:30.349> finally<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.560> think

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
sword from the stone finally I think

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.660 
sword from the stone finally I think
think<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.480> might<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.690> strong<00:00:34.079> enough<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.940> maybe

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
think I might be strong enough now maybe

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
think I might be strong enough now maybe
really<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.910> entirely<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:41.690> but<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.750> believe<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
really not entirely sure but I believe I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.130 
really not entirely sure but I believe I
should<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.280> able<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.600> maxed

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
should be able to because I have maxed

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.459 
should be able to because I have maxed
out<00:00:46.320> physique<00:00:46.860> health<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> also<00:00:48.180> toughness

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:01.390 

so<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> guess<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.920> shall<00:00:53.219> see
