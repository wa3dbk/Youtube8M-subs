00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
awesome I would say that the funnest

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.680 
awesome I would say that the funnest
part<00:01:12.290> about<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:12.950> how<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.700> wrenched<00:01:14.270> out<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
part about it is how it wrenched out the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.870 
part about it is how it wrenched out the
courses<00:01:15.140> get<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.590> how<00:01:15.740> gnarly<00:01:16.100> they<00:01:16.280> get<00:01:16.670> and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
courses get and how gnarly they get and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.800 
courses get and how gnarly they get and
you're<00:01:17.270> working<00:01:17.570> your<00:01:17.690> way<00:01:17.720> through

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
you're working your way through

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.840 
you're working your way through
three-foot<00:01:18.500> trenches<00:01:19.009> over<00:01:19.280> three-foot

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
three-foot trenches over three-foot

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.150 
three-foot trenches over three-foot
headwalls<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.560> then<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:21.979> got

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
headwalls and and and then you got

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.280 
headwalls and and and then you got
stumps<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:22.700> rocks<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.180> ice<00:01:23.390> below<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:23.990> so

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
stumps and rocks and ice below that so

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.260 
stumps and rocks and ice below that so
it's<00:01:24.770> all<00:01:24.950> about<00:01:24.979> momentum<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:25.850> keeping<00:01:26.180> your

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's all about momentum and keeping your

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.400 
it's all about momentum and keeping your
speed<00:01:26.540> up<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.869> picking<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.500> clean<00:01:28.160> line<00:01:32.380> as<00:01:33.380> a

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
speed up and picking a clean line as a

the tuning you understand all of them I
helped<00:02:04.610> him<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.790> lot<00:02:04.939> as<00:02:05.659> far<00:02:05.780> as<00:02:06.080> just

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
helped him a lot as far as just

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.550 
helped him a lot as far as just
answering<00:02:06.650> questions<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.340> coaching<00:02:08.119> him<00:02:08.239> on

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
answering questions and coaching him on

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.949 
answering questions and coaching him on
setup<00:02:09.560> but<00:02:09.739> he's<00:02:09.920> very<00:02:10.130> good<00:02:10.280> at<00:02:10.549> everything

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.270 

so<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.140> really<00:02:15.319> important<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.190> have

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
so it's really important to have

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.040 
so it's really important to have
confidence<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.940> myself<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.900> have

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
confidence in myself but to have

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.680 
confidence in myself but to have
confidence<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.830> machine<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.540> whole

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
confidence in the machine that's a whole

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.540 
confidence in the machine that's a whole
nother<00:02:20.840> aspect<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:21.800> they<00:02:22.040> work<00:02:22.190> hand<00:02:22.459> in

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
nother aspect and then they work hand in

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.090 
nother aspect and then they work hand in
hand<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:22.970> each<00:02:23.000> other<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.959> feel<00:02:24.740> so

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
hand with each other I feel so

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.650 
hand with each other I feel so
comfortable<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> players<00:02:26.000> chassis<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
comfortable in the players chassis and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.690 
comfortable in the players chassis and
it<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.230> really<00:02:27.410> works<00:02:27.800> well<00:02:28.100> with<00:02:28.280> my<00:02:28.430> riding

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
it it really works well with my riding

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.420 
it it really works well with my riding
style<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.630> can<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:30.260> ride<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.250> pro

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
style you can really ride the pro

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.880 
style you can really ride the pro
chassis<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.540> hard<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.140> aggressively<00:02:33.620> as

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
chassis it's hard and aggressively as

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.699 
chassis it's hard and aggressively as
you<00:02:34.069> want<00:02:34.310> which<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.120> something<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.380> has<00:02:36.560> to

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
you want which is something that has to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.420 
you want which is something that has to
be<00:02:36.770> done<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.160> order<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.520> win<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.800> part<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
reason that players chassis works so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.990 
reason that players chassis works so
well<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.560> weight<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:43.070> mean<00:02:43.459> my<00:02:43.550> pro<00:02:43.790> arm
