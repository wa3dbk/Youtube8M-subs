00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
a different image every clip we see so I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
a different image every clip we see so I
don't<00:02:46.440> really<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.710> any<00:02:47.010> point<00:02:47.280> reading<00:02:48.150> into

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390

don't really see any point reading into
it<00:02:48.420> at<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.720> stage<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.980> clip<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> part<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it at this stage the clip is a part of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.730 
it at this stage the clip is a part of
an<00:02:51.270> entire<00:02:51.570> interview<00:02:52.350> with<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> director

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
an entire interview with the director

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.620 
an entire interview with the director
but<00:02:53.280> he<00:02:53.520> doesn't<00:02:53.790> really<00:02:53.880> say<00:02:54.120> anything<00:02:54.150> we

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
but he doesn't really say anything we

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.390 
but he doesn't really say anything we
haven't<00:02:54.810> heard<00:02:55.080> before<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.620> think<00:02:56.130> he's<00:02:56.250> still

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
haven't heard before I think he's still

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.590 
haven't heard before I think he's still
trying<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.700> convince<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.180> all<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
trying to convince you all that the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.990 
trying to convince you all that the
game's<00:02:57.810> going<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.230> be<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.680> difficult<00:02:59.000> so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
game's going to be just as difficult so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.790 
game's going to be just as difficult so
that<00:03:00.360> pretty<00:03:00.660> much<00:03:00.750> sums<00:03:01.050> up<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> beta<00:03:01.500> news

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
that pretty much sums up the beta news

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.620
