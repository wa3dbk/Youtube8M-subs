just like anybody else number three is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.400 
just like anybody else number three is
the<00:02:22.030> absurd<00:02:22.390> amount<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.810> meetings<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
the absurd amount of meetings and

wrong with that but I think that's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.240 
wrong with that but I think that's
something<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.080> don't<00:02:26.200> see<00:02:26.319> on<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.890> regular
