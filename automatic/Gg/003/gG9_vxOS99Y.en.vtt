Joshua Farnsworth I want to show you how
to<00:00:19.689> make<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:19.960> simple<00:00:20.349> shiplap<00:00:20.950> joint<00:00:21.340> so<00:00:21.939> what

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
to make a simple shiplap joint so what

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.780 
to make a simple shiplap joint so what
is<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.330> shiplap<00:00:22.660> joint<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.170> ship<00:00:23.800> ledge<00:00:23.980> stiff

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
is the shiplap joint a ship ledge stiff

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.210 
is the shiplap joint a ship ledge stiff
lap<00:00:25.000> joint<00:00:25.270> is<00:00:25.450> essentially<00:00:26.260> two<00:00:26.650> rabbet

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
lap joint is essentially two rabbet

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.180 
lap joint is essentially two rabbet
joints<00:00:27.640> in<00:00:28.350> opposition<00:00:29.350> to<00:00:29.710> each<00:00:29.740> other<00:00:30.010> to

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
joints in opposition to each other to

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.980 
joints in opposition to each other to
create<00:00:30.340> some<00:00:30.640> strength<00:00:30.940> there<00:00:31.210> and<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.840> works

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
create some strength there and it works

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.040 
create some strength there and it works
really<00:00:32.199> well<00:00:32.320> on<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.580> bottoms<00:00:33.970> of<00:00:36.449> like<00:00:37.449> tool

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
really well on the bottoms of like tool

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.939 
really well on the bottoms of like tool

tool chest drawers or anything where you

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.030 
tool chest drawers or anything where you
don't<00:00:42.250> want<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.400> have<00:00:42.839> the<00:00:43.839> warping<00:00:44.589> action<00:00:44.949> of

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
don't want to have the warping action of

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.000 
don't want to have the warping action of
a<00:00:45.129> large<00:00:45.339> panel<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.089> you<00:00:46.750> want<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.170> keep<00:00:47.799> it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
a large panel and you want to keep it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.509 
a large panel and you want to keep it
from<00:00:48.309> falling<00:00:49.059> apart<00:00:49.330> you<00:00:50.229> can<00:00:50.409> see<00:00:50.440> here<00:00:51.010> this

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
from falling apart you can see here this

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.700 
from falling apart you can see here this
one<00:00:51.850> has<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.089> nice<00:00:52.449> bead<00:00:52.930> put<00:00:53.320> on<00:00:53.440> it<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.650> I'll

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
one has a nice bead put on it and I'll

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.119 
one has a nice bead put on it and I'll
show<00:00:53.769> how<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.070> do<00:00:54.280> that<00:00:54.430> in<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.239> next<00:00:55.420> video

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
show how to do that in the next video

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.520 
show how to do that in the next video
but<00:00:57.129> they<00:00:57.489> hold<00:00:58.420> together<00:00:58.570> really<00:00:58.989> nicely<00:00:59.290> and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
but they hold together really nicely and

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.869 
but they hold together really nicely and
tightly<00:00:59.860> when<00:00:59.979> it's<00:01:00.100> there<00:01:00.280> inside<00:01:00.580> of<00:01:00.760> your

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
tightly when it's there inside of your

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.410 
tightly when it's there inside of your
box<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:03.519> can't<00:01:03.760> even<00:01:03.879> tell<00:01:04.119> that<00:01:04.150> there's

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
box so you can't even tell that there's

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.760 
box so you can't even tell that there's
a<00:01:04.479> ship<00:01:04.750> lap<00:01:04.930> joint<00:01:05.920> in<00:01:06.070> there<00:01:06.280> from<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.729> back

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
a ship lap joint in there from the back

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330 
a ship lap joint in there from the back
so<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.070> did<00:01:09.190> was<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.729> simply<00:01:11.130> cut<00:01:12.130> one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
so what I did was I simply cut one

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.730 
so what I did was I simply cut one
rabbit<00:01:12.549> here<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:13.899> nice<00:01:14.079> I<00:01:14.259> put<00:01:14.439> a<00:01:14.469> fence

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
rabbit here with a nice I put a fence

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.440 
rabbit here with a nice I put a fence
here<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.189> I<00:01:15.219> use<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.520> shoulder<00:01:15.789> plane<00:01:16.180> and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
here and I use the shoulder plane and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.440 
here and I use the shoulder plane and
you<00:01:17.229> could<00:01:17.409> just<00:01:17.619> as<00:01:17.740> easily<00:01:17.859> use<00:01:18.450> moving

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
you could just as easily use moving

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.639 
you could just as easily use moving
Phyllis<00:01:19.780> tur<00:01:19.930> plane<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:21.460> or<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:23.229> rabbit

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
Phyllis tur plane like this or a rabbit

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.050 
Phyllis tur plane like this or a rabbit
plane<00:01:24.329> like<00:01:25.329> this<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:26.140> happen<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.409> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
plane like this I just happen to have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.090 
plane like this I just happen to have
this<00:01:28.060> shoulder<00:01:28.359> plane<00:01:28.659> tuned<00:01:28.990> up<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.469> so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
this shoulder plane tuned up and so

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.099 
this shoulder plane tuned up and so
that's<00:01:30.250> what<00:01:30.369> I've<00:01:30.490> used<00:01:30.700> it's<00:01:31.450> nice<00:01:31.899> and

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
that's what I've used it's nice and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:38.010 
that's what I've used it's nice and
sharp<00:01:32.289> here<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.200> will<00:01:35.350> take<00:01:37.020> these

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
sharp here and so I will take these

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.010 
sharp here and so I will take these
holdfasts<00:01:38.740> off<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.359> see<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.659> rabbit

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
holdfasts off and you can see the rabbit

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
holdfasts off and you can see the rabbit
that<00:01:41.049> I've<00:01:41.229> cut<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.880> what<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.060> need<00:01:43.179> to<00:01:43.299> do<00:01:43.570> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that I've cut so what I need to do is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.719 
that I've cut so what I need to do is
find<00:01:46.090> my<00:01:46.210> other<00:01:46.450> piece<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.950> see<00:01:48.130> it's<00:01:48.429> in

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
find my other piece you can see it's in

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.160 
find my other piece you can see it's in
here<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:50.109> made<00:01:50.770> note<00:01:51.039> of<00:01:51.070> how<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:51.399> wanted<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
here and I made note of how I wanted of

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.499 
here and I made note of how I wanted of
which<00:01:53.649> side<00:01:53.859> I<00:01:53.890> wanted<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.310> rabbit<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:55.149> go<00:01:55.299> on

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
which side I wanted the rabbit to go on

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.480 
which side I wanted the rabbit to go on
on<00:01:55.780> each<00:01:55.929> side<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:56.619> they'll<00:01:56.799> go<00:01:56.890> in<00:01:57.009> opposition

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
on each side so they'll go in opposition

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.870 
on each side so they'll go in opposition
like<00:01:57.609> that<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.829> I<00:01:59.920> will<00:01:59.979> cut<00:02:00.249> take<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.640> out

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
like that so I will cut take this out

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.070 
like that so I will cut take this out
and<00:02:01.170> place<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.350> there<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:06.569> what<00:02:07.569> I<00:02:07.600> did<00:02:07.869> was<00:02:08.020> I

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and place it there and what I did was I

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.350 
and place it there and what I did was I
set<00:02:08.679> my<00:02:08.830> marking<00:02:09.280> gauge<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.759> make<00:02:09.880> these<00:02:10.149> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
set my marking gauge to make these the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.860 
set my marking gauge to make these the
same<00:02:10.600> width<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.250> can<00:02:12.430> see<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.910> just

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
same width so you can see I just

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.360 
same width so you can see I just
described<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.710> down<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:14.950> don't<00:02:15.160> know<00:02:15.250> what

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
described this down I don't know what

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.440 
described this down I don't know what
that<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.700> quarter<00:02:16.030> inch<00:02:16.060> or<00:02:16.270> something

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
that is a quarter inch or something

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.270 
that is a quarter inch or something
whatever<00:02:17.080> however<00:02:17.500> much<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.860> want<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.159> to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
whatever however much you want them to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.470 
whatever however much you want them to
overlap<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.680> strength<00:02:21.099> there

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
overlap for strength there

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.980 
overlap for strength there
and<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:25.940> out<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.330> way<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.780> I'll

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
and just do this out of the way and I'll

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.900 
and just do this out of the way and I'll
just<00:02:27.700> run<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.850> right<00:02:29.660> along<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:31.430> what<00:02:31.730> that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
just run this right along and what that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.490 
just run this right along and what that
does<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:34.000> marking<00:02:35.000> gauge<00:02:35.560> line<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.850> gives<00:02:38.060> me

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
does that marking gauge line it gives me

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.140 
does that marking gauge line it gives me
like<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.680> guide<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.010> where<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.610> put<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.880> fence

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
like a guide of where to put the fence

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.450 
like a guide of where to put the fence
and<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.080> can<00:02:42.920> also<00:02:43.070> mark<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.640> right<00:02:44.350> there<00:02:45.460> so

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
and so I can also mark it right there so

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.520 
and so I can also mark it right there so
that<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.790> look<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.230> ends<00:02:48.230> when<00:02:48.440> I'm

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
that I can look on the ends when I'm

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.190 
that I can look on the ends when I'm
working<00:02:50.680> if<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.800> can<00:02:51.950> see<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:53.480> then<00:02:54.110> I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
working if you can see that and then I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.050 
working if you can see that and then I
simply<00:02:54.410> put<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:54.830> back<00:02:55.010> here<00:02:55.520> in<00:02:57.490> on<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.910> edge

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
simply put it back here in on the edge

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.770 
simply put it back here in on the edge
of<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.360> bench<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:00.760> put<00:03:01.760> B<00:03:03.880> fence<00:03:04.880> up<00:03:05.270> against

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
of the bench and put B fence up against

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.340 
of the bench and put B fence up against
the<00:03:05.930> marking<00:03:06.290> gauge<00:03:06.650> line<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.430> had<00:03:07.760> cut

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
the marking gauge line that I had cut

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:19.030 
the marking gauge line that I had cut
with<00:03:09.350> my<00:03:09.560> gauge<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:12.280> line<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.550> right<00:03:13.700> up<00:03:18.040> smack

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
with my gauge and line it right up smack

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.860 
with my gauge and line it right up smack
those<00:03:19.280> holdfast<00:03:19.880> down<00:03:20.120> strong<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.720> see

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
those holdfast down strong you can see

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.870 
those holdfast down strong you can see
how<00:03:20.990> how<00:03:21.860> well<00:03:22.070> they<00:03:22.220> hold<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.520> work<00:03:22.670> down

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
how how well they hold to work down

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.340 
how how well they hold to work down
that's<00:03:23.090> what<00:03:23.209> that's<00:03:23.690> what<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.110> hold

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
that's what that's what I like to hold

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.960 
that's what that's what I like to hold
it<00:03:24.440> down<00:03:24.590> with<00:03:24.830> when<00:03:25.130> I'm<00:03:25.220> doing<00:03:25.459> rabbits<00:03:25.820> like

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
it down with when I'm doing rabbits like

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.990 
it down with when I'm doing rabbits like
this<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.970> just<00:03:29.209> start<00:03:29.420> taking<00:03:29.780> passes

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
this and then just start taking passes

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.540 
this and then just start taking passes
keep<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.209> mind<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:33.320> not<00:03:33.470> go<00:03:34.280> like<00:03:34.400> that

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
keep it in mind to to not go like that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.920 
keep it in mind to to not go like that
or<00:03:34.760> like<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.360> keep<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.630> straight<00:03:35.900> up

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
or like that but to keep it straight up

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.880 
or like that but to keep it straight up
and<00:03:36.140> down<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:38.380> if<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.500> want<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.860> can<00:03:40.040> also

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
and down and if you want you can also

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.350 
and down and if you want you can also
take<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.920> marking<00:03:43.370> gauge<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.790> give<00:03:43.880> yourself<00:03:44.269> a

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
take a marking gauge and give yourself a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.990 
take a marking gauge and give yourself a
depth<00:03:44.630> line<00:03:45.140> on<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.440> first<00:03:45.650> one<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:46.910> you

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
depth line on the first one so that you

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.090 
depth line on the first one so that you
can<00:03:47.120> make<00:03:47.269> sure<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.560> don't<00:03:48.739> go<00:03:48.830> past

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
can make sure that you don't go past

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.740 
can make sure that you don't go past
that<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:49.850> with<00:03:49.940> this<00:03:50.060> I'm<00:03:50.269> just<00:03:50.420> going<00:03:50.720> to

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that but with this I'm just going to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.050 
that but with this I'm just going to
when<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.709> feel<00:03:52.070> like<00:03:52.160> I'm<00:03:52.280> getting<00:03:52.489> close<00:03:52.790> I

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
when I feel like I'm getting close I

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.410 
when I feel like I'm getting close I
went<00:03:53.269> about<00:03:53.420> halfway<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:55.549> when<00:03:56.390> I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
went about halfway on this one when I

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.880 
went about halfway on this one when I
feel<00:03:56.570> like<00:03:56.630> I'm<00:03:56.780> getting<00:03:56.870> close<00:03:57.290> I'll<00:03:57.620> just

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
feel like I'm getting close I'll just

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.100 
feel like I'm getting close I'll just
take<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.549> measure<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.110> when

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
take this here and measure it and when

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.860 
take this here and measure it and when
they<00:04:00.410> are<00:04:00.739> level<00:04:01.670> together<00:04:02.060> then<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.510> means

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
they are level together then that means

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.550 
they are level together then that means
that<00:04:03.200> I'm<00:04:04.100> all<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.430> way<00:04:04.459> down<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:06.380> where<00:04:06.500> I

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
that I'm all the way down to where I

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560 
that I'm all the way down to where I
need<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.830> be<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.950> very<00:04:10.370> easy<00:04:11.000> joint

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
need to be so this is a very easy joint

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.259 
need to be so this is a very easy joint
for<00:04:11.810> beginners<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.380> use<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.830> it's<00:04:13.090> great<00:04:14.090> if

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
for beginners to use and it's great if

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.719 
for beginners to use and it's great if
you<00:04:14.420> want<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.260> start<00:04:15.500> off<00:04:16.570> making

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
you want to start off making

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.340 
you want to start off making
boxes<00:04:19.729> or<00:04:20.000> tool<00:04:20.209> chests<00:04:20.780> or<00:04:20.989> anything<00:04:21.199> that

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
boxes or tool chests or anything that

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.150 
boxes or tool chests or anything that
has<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:22.600> drawer<00:04:23.600> bottom<00:04:23.960> like<00:04:24.139> that<00:04:26.470> so<00:04:27.470> let's

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
has a drawer bottom like that so let's

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.480 
has a drawer bottom like that so let's
see<00:04:28.250> how<00:04:28.520> close<00:04:29.360> I'm<00:04:29.600> getting<00:04:30.250> go<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.280> little

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
see how close I'm getting go a little

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:47.080 
see how close I'm getting go a little
further<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:44.240> now<00:04:44.389> I'll<00:04:44.630> test<00:04:44.960> this<00:04:45.830> here<00:04:46.310> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
further so now I'll test this here you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.909 
further so now I'll test this here you
can<00:04:47.240> see<00:04:47.479> it<00:04:47.570> alright<00:04:48.580> I'll<00:04:49.580> set<00:04:49.910> it<00:04:49.940> here<00:04:50.919> and

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
can see it alright I'll set it here and

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.490 
can see it alright I'll set it here and
it<00:04:52.010> looks<00:04:52.190> like<00:04:52.250> I'm<00:04:52.430> close<00:04:53.139> it's<00:04:54.139> also<00:04:54.289> a<00:04:54.410> good

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
it looks like I'm close it's also a good

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.870 
it looks like I'm close it's also a good
idea<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.860> check<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.250> make<00:04:55.280> sure<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.610> you're

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
idea to check to make sure that you're

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.300 
idea to check to make sure that you're
not<00:04:56.030> playing<00:04:56.660> that<00:04:56.780> way<00:04:57.020> or<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.350> way<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.740> you

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
not playing that way or that way and you

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.370 
not playing that way or that way and you
can<00:04:58.340> tell<00:04:58.699> just<00:04:59.120> by<00:04:59.180> eyeballing<00:04:59.389> it<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:03.020> I

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
can tell just by eyeballing it and I

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.890 
can tell just by eyeballing it and I
think<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.740> need<00:05:03.919> probably<00:05:04.550> one<00:05:04.789> or<00:05:05.060> two<00:05:05.600> more

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
think I need probably one or two more

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.640 
think I need probably one or two more
passes<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:08.630> I'll<00:05:08.720> be<00:05:08.870> good<00:05:11.199> it's<00:05:12.199> vital<00:05:12.620> that

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
passes and I'll be good it's vital that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.810 
passes and I'll be good it's vital that
you<00:05:12.800> keep<00:05:13.039> this<00:05:13.520> fence<00:05:14.229> tightened<00:05:15.229> down

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
you keep this fence tightened down

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.980 
you keep this fence tightened down
really<00:05:16.820> well<00:05:17.030> because<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.510> this<00:05:17.660> starts<00:05:17.870> to

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
really well because if this starts to

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.360 
really well because if this starts to
slide<00:05:18.229> then<00:05:18.500> you'll<00:05:18.620> have<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:19.100> rabbit<00:05:20.289> joint

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
slide then you'll have a rabbit joint

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.670 
slide then you'll have a rabbit joint
that<00:05:22.370> will<00:05:22.669> be<00:05:22.849> skewed<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.289> don't<00:05:24.470> want

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
that will be skewed and you don't want

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.089 
that will be skewed and you don't want
one<00:05:24.979> of<00:05:25.010> those<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:28.030> that's<00:05:29.030> pretty<00:05:29.330> close<00:05:30.099> at

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
one of those and that's pretty close at

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.219 
one of those and that's pretty close at
least<00:05:31.160> for<00:05:31.610> television<00:05:34.810> so<00:05:35.810> let's<00:05:35.930> see<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.139> you

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
least for television so let's see if you

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.219 
least for television so let's see if you
can<00:05:36.380> see<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:37.270> hum<00:05:38.270> piece<00:05:38.510> that<00:05:38.780> scared<00:05:39.110> me

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
can see that hum piece that scared me

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:45.580 
can see that hum piece that scared me
for<00:05:39.260> a<00:05:39.470> minute<00:05:41.620> so<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.830> see<00:05:43.990> how<00:05:44.990> nicely

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
for a minute so you can see how nicely

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.310 
for a minute so you can see how nicely
that<00:05:45.889> fits<00:05:46.160> together<00:05:46.340> there<00:05:46.760> in<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:48.229> next

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
that fits together there in the next

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.670 
that fits together there in the next
video<00:05:48.680> I'll<00:05:48.949> show<00:05:49.190> you<00:05:49.220> how<00:05:49.370> to<00:05:50.139> put<00:05:51.139> a<00:05:51.169> bead<00:05:51.440> on

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.580

this<00:05:52.520> joint<00:05:52.940> so<00:05:53.720> that<00:05:53.900> doesn't<00:05:54.110> look<00:05:54.380> like

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
this joint so that doesn't look like

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.420 
this joint so that doesn't look like
just<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.039> boring<00:05:55.330> ugly<00:05:56.740> line<00:05:57.740> between<00:05:58.070> two

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430
