00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.670
 chevrolet brings a new suv to the 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.170
 German market follows the tracks with it 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.769
 the american manufacturer one 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.130
 long tradition built in 1935 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.519
 chevrolet with the suburban kerio that 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.140
 first so-called sport utility vehicle 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.449
 78 years later , we take the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:29.800
 new suv from the house chevrolet one 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:31.419
 Probe finds what we are here right now 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.550
 Most people never do it 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.110
 with your car because no human value 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.830
 with it in the terrain but it should be so 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.630
 appearance 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.240
 why do you still buy one 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.180
 suv clearly one sits higher because of that 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.410
 his car is much clearer and easier 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.880
 in practice, these things are still the same 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.530
 tracks for example has the possibility 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.170
 that you have the passenger seat back 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.940
 can fold and then nothing is like 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.010
 from the furniture market because then fit the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.570
 shelves rhein with a maximum length 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.850
 up to 230 of the tracks split 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.620
 his platform with the opel mother 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.299
 with a few simple steps can be 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.799
 fold over the seats of the track 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.040
 This will increase the maximum load capacity 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.080
 of 1370 liters reached, however 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.799
 we do not pack shelves in the car 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.799
 but the life-size image of a 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.799
 basketball, player 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.909
 the shield bulli marks logo graces the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.590
 big grille 1 meter 70 wide and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.350
 four meters 20 long that's extreme 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.759
 compact size for a suv and that makes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649
 of course also in the interior 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.360
 noticeable 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.039
 he is tidy and clearly structured 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.039
 the driver quickly finds his way 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.180

 This is a smartphone over Bluetooth 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.870

 the system will be operated three 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.950
 Motorizations stand for the tracks 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.380

 Drive a 1.7 liter diesel engine with 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.930
 96 kilo power 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.240
