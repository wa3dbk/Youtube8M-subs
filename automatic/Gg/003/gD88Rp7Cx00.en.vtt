00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.039
 it's not necessary to be an expert in aerodynamics and mechanics 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.559
 of flight to fly an aircraft some knowledge is 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.220
 essential to better understand how our machines work 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.380
 and find out why certain verification actions are vital 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.870
 hello and welcome to this third sequence of eight agents 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.050
 first of a series devoted to the second they do not fly 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.660
 last thing in training 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.600
 of the subject we base our reasoning 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.580
 even with the power of level flight stabilize it's a 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.190
 simplification which will allow us all the same 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.230
 and really understand the reality 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 takeoff 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.050
 m 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 so 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.080
 their takeoff 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 these top 20 recipes 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.690
 the balance of the year 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
 the same way 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 real estate agents in the nation 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.560
 the rebellion 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 the United Nations 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.300
 takeoff now allow themselves to forests or flying 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.730
 it is an operational physical constraint the plane to take off 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.500
 two that its maneuverability guarantees 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.040
 to overcome obstacles hurdle 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.250
 entry 7 rennais 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 and other high lift devices 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 and continue his climb to the team 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.290
 what those flying schemes 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.149
 exact we chose a little better 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.149
 alain in the power settings finally after his admission 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.120
 the propeller because these parameters at this stage is significant with the evolution 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.119
 aircraft speed 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.229
 elise for regulation at 2500 rpm 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.509
 truthful 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.509
 diallo 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.509
 m 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.289
 the 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.289
 we did not think about mali and africa from maule 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:49.319
 the position of the leaning depth corresponds to the incidence of power 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.479
 minimum required steering wheel 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.749
 when we decrease the silence the ship is indeed the air 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.339
 if allowed to return to the compensation effect 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.819
 you would have stabilizing bearing 1 95 m 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.199
 barack obama silence 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.079
 the increase in mortality to the reorientation of the trajectory of 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.079
 the plane 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.429
 when he arrived the island of Ouessant 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:31.870
 another situation 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.049
 at lower incidence yes higher 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.049
 at the incidence of minimum power needed happy 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.819
 quickly the pot the plane goes down 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.629
 drawing the necessary power curve 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.969
 according to the speed 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.669
 reducing the intake pressure inch by inch destabilizing every time 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:50.989
 the ps 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.009
 bound up to the minimum power required for the flight 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.139
 then at the second speed reducing speed in steps of 5 knots until the 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.699
 virtue serves as a stall 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.399
 stabilization is not easy in the second regime 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.659
 if ever a little too much power the plane time accelerate to the point 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.899
 corresponding to the first flight regime 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.219
 and if I do not have enough, we need more 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.219
 power 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.949
 wallers 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.359
 valid for five years 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.099
 the war between the necessary power the useful power represents the 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.690
 ability of the European airplane to accelerate because we had a 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.920
 stabilized on an upward trajectory 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.229
 it's the power of the engine 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.220
 yes in the field as on all aircraft well motorized 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.930
 the nominal power output is greater than the power required 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.930
 Stabilize flights steadily until stall 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.949
 this means that this year have the ability to accelerate and ride it 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.169
 understood close to the stall 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.639
 but its stability and maneuverability and its address 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.319
 and the motor effects are very important 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.069
 this increases the risk of loss of control of the device 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:00.800
 true 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.270
 certify it 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.599
 as for him alone more after persuaded two curves intersect between his father 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.009
 and the stall 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.439
 but we have to raise finance 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.400
 for the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.610
 zeller you have to go down 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.819
 it will go down even more stupid 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.460
 because even more readable 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.849
 the beautiful family 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.849
 m for nine years after the fatal intervention 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.819
 common language often equates the choice of the gironde 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.819
 better ensure domain 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.569
 to illustrate what happens during takeoff bringing closer the curves of a 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.349
 real situation 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.849
 in the following sequence you will see the simulation of takeoff from a 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.610
 overloaded airplane 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.800
 the pilot manages the rotation well given the circumstances the takeoff takes place 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.120
 but quickly looking for a slope to climb too high leads him beyond 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.319
 listening point power 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.550
 from there you will see how the available power decreases as you 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.029
 that increases the power needed for wolves 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.029
 you have to go down to not go to the stall 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.759
 the victory gained allows the pilot to return to flight conditions 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.159
 normal but it commits a new the same mistake this time until the 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:11.819
 loss of control 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.199
 have given it we have positioned three axes that of the useful power 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.599
 that of the necessary power and that of the engine driving parameters 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.559
 after his admission to the outline and nice 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.869
 on these axes of the days they will allow you to visualize the evolution 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:29.869
 relative of these parameters 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.029
 but my
