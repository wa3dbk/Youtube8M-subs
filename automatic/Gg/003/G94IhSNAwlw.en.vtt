00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750 
get the full complete set but we are
getting<00:00:55.350> increments<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:56.579> nice

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
getting increments and that's very nice

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.810 
getting increments and that's very nice
to<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> game<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.160> let's<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to see in a game so let's go to the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020 
to see in a game so let's go to the
first<00:01:00.000> set<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.199> smugglers<00:01:01.680> den<00:01:02.030> this

first set which is smugglers den this
has<00:01:03.270> two<00:01:03.660> sets<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> 15<00:01:04.670> I'll<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
has two sets of 15 I'll just go to the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.840 
has two sets of 15 I'll just go to the
first<00:01:06.330> level<00:01:06.979> sort<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:08.310> store<00:01:08.549> here

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
first level sort of a little store here

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
first level sort of a little store here
as<00:01:09.000> usual<00:01:09.500> instead<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> attacking<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.220> pigs

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
as usual instead of attacking the pigs

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.050 
as usual instead of attacking the pigs
you're<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:11.970> trying<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.229> hit<00:01:13.530> cages<00:01:14.130> with

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you're now trying to hit cages with

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.020 
you're now trying to hit cages with
friendly<00:01:15.780> birds<00:01:16.020> inside<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.909> have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
friendly birds inside so you just have

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.660 
friendly birds inside so you just have
to<00:01:18.119> hit<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> cages<00:01:18.570> Andrew<00:01:19.049> birds<00:01:19.259> escape

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
to hit the cages Andrew birds escape

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.660 
to hit the cages Andrew birds escape
that's<00:01:20.670> essentially<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> story<00:01:22.670> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that's essentially the story the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
that's essentially the story the
gameplay<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.150> simpler<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:25.560> simple

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
gameplay is very simpler very simple

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.990 
gameplay is very simpler very simple
just<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.369> usual<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.509> via<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.680> idea<00:01:29.670> behind<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
just as usual it via the idea behind the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.020 
just as usual it via the idea behind the
game<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> exactly<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> same<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.939> have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
game is exactly the same you just have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
game is exactly the same you just have
some<00:01:33.180> nice<00:01:33.329> improvements<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.439> see

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
some nice improvements so as you see

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.440 
some nice improvements so as you see
when<00:01:34.829> i<00:01:34.860> scroll<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.180> something

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
when i scroll here you have something

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.190 
when i scroll here you have something
called<00:01:36.570> parallax<00:01:37.020> scrolling<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.079> way

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
called parallax scrolling so the way

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440 
called parallax scrolling so the way
it's<00:01:40.350> girls<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.180> environment

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it's girls it's not just the environment

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.530 
it's girls it's not just the environment
Scrolls<00:01:43.229> differently<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.240> bird

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
Scrolls differently so this this bird

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.080 
Scrolls differently so this this bird
these<00:01:46.020> cages<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.740> stuff<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.579> scroll<00:01:47.790> one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
these cages and stuff will scroll one

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
these cages and stuff will scroll one
speed<00:01:48.390> whereas<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> background<00:01:49.350> scrolls<00:01:50.130> at

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
speed whereas the background scrolls at

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039 
speed whereas the background scrolls at
another<00:01:50.549> maybe<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.360> night<00:01:51.390> nice

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
another maybe some night nice

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
another maybe some night nice
interactive<00:01:52.560> elements<00:01:53.159> such<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.610> fan

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
interactive elements such as this fan

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.060 
interactive elements such as this fan
back<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.939> foreground<00:01:57.920> kind<00:01:58.920> of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
back here and the foreground kind of

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
back here and the foreground kind of
zooms<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.880> and<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.119> these<00:02:00.420> crates<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
zooms in and out these crates up here so

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.399 
zooms in and out these crates up here so
overall<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.399> nice<00:02:02.610> graphically<00:02:03.409> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
overall it's very nice graphically and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
overall it's very nice graphically and
sometimes<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.460> later<00:02:05.640> levels<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.509> like

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
sometimes in later levels we have like

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
sometimes in later levels we have like
things<00:02:07.469> hanging<00:02:07.710> down<00:02:08.039> from<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.310> here<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
things hanging down from up here and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820 
things hanging down from up here and
when<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> hit<00:02:09.390> them<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> drops<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.110> tnt<00:02:10.800> or

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
when you hit them it drops like tnt or

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.730
