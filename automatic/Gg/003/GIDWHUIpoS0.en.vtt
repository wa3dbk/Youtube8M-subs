some sort of a framework which will

not going to characterize it I think we

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.259 
not going to characterize it I think we
made<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> proposal<00:02:47.189> consistent<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.239> our

made a proposal consistent with our

made a proposal consistent with our
principles<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.530> think<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.489> Gary's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
principles and I think that Gary's

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.399 
principles and I think that Gary's
likely<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.720> say<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:51.900> weighed<00:02:52.230> one

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
likely to say they weighed one

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.229 
likely to say they weighed one
consistent<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.099> there's<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.579> schedule<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
consistent with there's a schedule the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.289 
consistent with there's a schedule the
other<00:02:54.359> time<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.750> talk<00:02:54.980> not<00:02:55.980> formally<00:02:56.609> no<00:02:56.909> but

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
other time to talk not formally no but

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.990 
other time to talk not formally no but
the<00:02:57.689> expectation<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.680> if<00:02:59.549> not<00:02:59.819> before

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the expectation is that if not before

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.990 
the expectation is that if not before
we'll<00:03:00.419> talk<00:03:00.659> after<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.459> owners<00:03:02.459> meeting<00:03:02.819> ends

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
we'll talk after the owners meeting ends

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.979 
we'll talk after the owners meeting ends
tomorrow<00:03:03.299> we<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:05.269> lots<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.419> time<00:03:06.629> for<00:03:06.689> our

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
tomorrow we have lots of time for our

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.270 
tomorrow we have lots of time for our

I'd we're not in a position to make a

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
not going to characterize it beyond what

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.680 
not going to characterize it beyond what
I've<00:03:29.280> said<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.639> was<00:03:29.790> consistent<00:03:30.359> with<00:03:30.419> our

begin if no agreement is reached we take

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.870 
begin if no agreement is reached we take
him<00:04:11.030> at<00:04:11.150> his<00:04:11.180> word<00:04:11.300> as<00:04:11.750> we<00:04:11.900> have<00:04:12.110> for<00:04:12.880> better

to<00:04:35.450> see<00:04:35.600> hockey<00:04:35.810> interrupted<00:04:37.480> we<00:04:38.480> believe

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
to see hockey interrupted we believe

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.910 
to see hockey interrupted we believe
that<00:04:39.400> under<00:04:40.400> Quebec<00:04:41.180> law<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.810> lockout<00:04:42.680> would

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
that under Quebec law a lockout would

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.500 
that under Quebec law a lockout would
not<00:04:43.130> be<00:04:43.310> appropriate<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:44.000> would<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:44.330> be

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
not be appropriate and would not be

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.120 
not be appropriate and would not be
legal<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:44.990> we're<00:04:45.140> asserting<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.590> position

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
legal so we're asserting that position

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.920 
legal so we're asserting that position
you<00:04:46.910> know<00:04:47.000> we<00:04:47.150> would<00:04:47.300> like<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.480> think<00:04:47.840> that

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
you know we would like to think that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.600 
you know we would like to think that
that's<00:04:48.200> consistent<00:04:48.860> with<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.160> interests<00:04:49.520> of

that's consistent with the interests of

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
would mean that a lockout would not be

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:11.350 
would mean that a lockout would not be
