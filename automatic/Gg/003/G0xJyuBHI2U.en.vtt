you're hurt the n450 is the 1.66

you're hurt the n450 is the 1.66
gigahertz<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> slightly<00:00:37.829> faster

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
gigahertz they have a slightly faster

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
gigahertz they have a slightly faster
front<00:00:38.430> side<00:00:38.610> bus<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> turn<00:00:39.629> overclocks

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
front side bus which in turn overclocks

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
front side bus which in turn overclocks
the<00:00:40.320> processor<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> little<00:00:41.160> bit<00:00:41.280> gives

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the processor just a little bit gives

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.950 
the processor just a little bit gives
you<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> little<00:00:42.149> bit<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.420> performance<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
you a little bit more performance and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
you a little bit more performance and
it's<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.500> bit<00:00:43.649> more<00:00:43.829> efficient<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:44.250> well

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's a little bit more efficient as well

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
it's a little bit more efficient as well
so<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.539> bit<00:00:45.629> better<00:00:45.719> battery

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so you get a little bit better battery

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.610 
so you get a little bit better battery
life<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:48.030> standard<00:00:48.360> display

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
life now it is your standard display

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
life now it is your standard display
1024<00:00:49.620> x<00:00:49.739> 600<00:00:50.070> standard<00:00:50.760> keyboard<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
1024 x 600 standard keyboard it's a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
1024 x 600 standard keyboard it's a
little<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:51.989> smaller<00:00:52.289> than<00:00:52.350> normal<00:00:52.730> compared

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
little bit smaller than normal compared

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit smaller than normal compared
to<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> computer<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> very<00:00:55.230> nice<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to a computer but is very nice for a

to a computer but is very nice for a
netbook<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.660> using<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.230> small

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
netbook if you're using the really small

netbook if you're using the really small
keyboards<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> old<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.520> older<00:00:59.670> older

keyboards on the old or older older

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.240 
keyboards on the old or older older
maybe<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.840> original<00:01:01.199> Triple<00:01:01.469> E<00:01:01.590> asus

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
maybe like the original Triple E asus

maybe like the original Triple E asus
netbooks<00:01:02.579> these<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.910> much<00:01:03.239> much<00:01:03.449> nicer<00:01:03.530> much

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

millimeter headset Jack's a VGA out port

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.850 
millimeter headset Jack's a VGA out port
which<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.549> useful<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.420> 10100<00:01:58.350> ethernet

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
which is useful and then 10100 ethernet

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
which is useful and then 10100 ethernet
now<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.700> improvement<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.299> been<00:02:00.420> made

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
now the improvement that have been made

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
now the improvement that have been made
actually<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.829> dealing<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.000> wireless

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
actually are dealing with the wireless

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
actually are dealing with the wireless
you<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.509> 802<00:02:03.899> 11<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.640> these<00:02:06.000> netbooks

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you have 802 11 now on these netbooks

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.900 
you have 802 11 now on these netbooks
which<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> good<00:02:07.409> improvement<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.520> end<00:02:08.640> end

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
which is a good improvement the end end

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.449 
which is a good improvement the end end
spec<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:11.280> times

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
spec is actually about three times

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.880 
spec is actually about three times
faster<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.209> three<00:02:12.480> times<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> range<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
faster in about three times the range so

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.320 
faster in about three times the range so
up<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> thousand<00:02:14.700> meters<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.060> range<00:02:15.240> when

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
up to a thousand meters of range when

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.710 
up to a thousand meters of range when
you're<00:02:15.450> unobstructed<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.860> also<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.569> up<00:02:18.569> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
you're unobstructed you also have up to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.150 
you're unobstructed you also have up to
three<00:02:18.930> hundred<00:02:18.959> megabit<00:02:19.470> per<00:02:19.500> second<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
three hundred megabit per second of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 
three hundred megabit per second of
overall<00:02:20.670> bandwidth<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.390> very<00:02:21.660> fast<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.170> you're

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
overall bandwidth so very fast if you're

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.800 
overall bandwidth so very fast if you're
looking<00:02:22.650> at<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:23.160> network<00:02:23.940> asset<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> video

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
looking at a network asset like a video

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
looking at a network asset like a video
that's<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.140> network<00:02:25.530> attached<00:02:25.709> server<00:02:26.010> or<00:02:26.760> a

that's on a network attached server or a

regular server in your own home you can

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.949 
regular server in your own home you can

or over that end draft wireless the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.910 
or over that end draft wireless the
option<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:32.970> yours<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.900> b<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.230> g<00:02:34.260> wireless<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
option is yours with b or g wireless you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.370 
option is yours with b or g wireless you
couldn't<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.630> very<00:02:36.959> nice<00:02:37.140> new

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
couldn't do that so it's a very nice new

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.620 
couldn't do that so it's a very nice new
feature<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.790> doesn't<00:02:39.180> seem<00:02:39.240> like<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.450> big

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
feature and it doesn't seem like a big

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.690 
feature and it doesn't seem like a big
deal<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.550> that's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
deal but it really really is and that's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.670 
deal but it really really is and that's
basically<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.270> very<00:02:42.810> very<00:02:43.050> simple<00:02:43.230> netbook

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
basically it very very simple netbook

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.110 
basically it very very simple netbook
