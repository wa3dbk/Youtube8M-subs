00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
iOS and the apps going to pop a full
screen<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.299> watch<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> I'll<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> couple

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
screen so watch it I'll do it a couple

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.630 
screen so watch it I'll do it a couple
times<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.890> probably<00:01:35.130> didn't<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
times and you probably didn't see it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.609 
times and you probably didn't see it
there<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.720> screen<00:01:37.079> recording<00:01:37.500> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
there because the screen recording is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.870 
there because the screen recording is
slowing<00:01:38.159> everything<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
slowing everything down all the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
slowing everything down all the
animations<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:40.020> I'll<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.439> bit

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
animations so I'll go a little bit

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
animations so I'll go a little bit
volunteer<00:01:41.090> okay<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.329> could<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> see

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
volunteer okay so you could kind of see

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
volunteer okay so you could kind of see
it<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.710> looks<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.189> smoother<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it there it looks a lot smoother and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
it there it looks a lot smoother and
more<00:01:45.500> fluid<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.130> reporting<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
more fluid when I'm not reporting the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
more fluid when I'm not reporting the
screen<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.680> how<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
screen but you can kind of see how that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
screen but you can kind of see how that
works<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:50.970> normally<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> went<00:01:51.990> full

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
works so now normally if you went full

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.030 
works so now normally if you went full
screen<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.610> would<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:55.259> space<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.890> your

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

screen this would be one space or your
desktop<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> take<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.090> one

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
desktop so this would be so take up one
