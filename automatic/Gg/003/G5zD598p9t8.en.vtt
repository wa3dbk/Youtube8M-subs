unique<00:00:59.160> sound<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.789> when<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.840> behind<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
unique sound and when up behind the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.709 
unique sound and when up behind the
decks<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.800> play<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.340> mostly<00:01:03.210> melodic<00:01:03.629> music

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.050 
haven't been in the studio for two years
and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.340> came<00:01:57.490> back<00:01:57.670> with<00:01:57.820> their<00:01:57.880> album

was<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.480> me<00:01:58.540> a<00:01:58.570> great<00:01:58.630> start<00:01:59.230> of<00:01:59.440> my<00:01:59.560> new

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
was for me a great start of my new

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.270 
was for me a great start of my new
production<00:02:00.670> career<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:02.590> because<00:02:02.860> I'm<00:02:02.980> here

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
production career not because I'm here

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.970 
production career not because I'm here
but<00:02:03.610> in<00:02:04.030> general<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.570> think<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.980> argentinian

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
but in general I think the argentinian

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.440 
but in general I think the argentinian
audience<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.760> definitely<00:02:07.150> one<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.300> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
audience is is definitely one of the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.270 
audience is is definitely one of the
