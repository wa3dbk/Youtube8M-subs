00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello swami sergey shmakov this video by 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 tablet settings brush settings for 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.340
 should work with most mountain destinations 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 the main thing is this video for those who 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 one way or another 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 being trained by me I specifically 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.390
 recording this video on technical 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 settings so that in no way 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 case does not waste time on individual 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
 training workshops for me 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.080
 I told you all these new ones 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.880
 technical moment I will brief you now 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.399
 concisely and fully tell you all that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 will be necessary in order to work 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.290
 with a tablet and should do well 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.239
 burn clean technically so 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's go initially you need 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.440
 set up the most important main tablet 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.450
 tuning then sensitivity cyrus us 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.520
 you need to remove it completely that is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.820
 turn our tablet into a mouse 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.710
 click we have a full press 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.270
 we will manage sensitivity with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.030
 using the brush settings itself 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.109
 further we need to adjust to the bottom 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.379
 pen button 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.990
 right click for what it is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.110
 done let's turn on the brush behind 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.680
 alt click and switch on the lower button on the pen 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 which is responsible for the right mouse button 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.420
 turn on we turn on the brush now 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.970
 moving left or right we change 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 brush size by moving in up or 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.369
 down we change the stiffness that is here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.270
 this resort no longer needs further 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.189
 what do we need here we need 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 where is the mapping tick on 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.689
 proportional to vertical and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.630
 the horizontal axis of the tablet worked 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.530
 proportionally meaning you are moving 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.090
 you also moved the pen with your hand 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.460
 moved the brush on the monitor to 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.770
 you controlled the process I have 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.540
 two monitors in this case if i 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 need to move between them if you have 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.100
 same situation then i'm on feathers on 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.200
 put the second button move 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.180
 between monitors I have this example 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.280
 on the left is the lightroom on the right of photoshop and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.860
 everywhere I work proportionally 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.470
 pie i just use one button 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.960
 moving between 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.450
 handwriting we didn't need to go 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.460
 I have six more on my tablet 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.290
 additional buttons that I can 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.110
 let's customize first 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.420
 look at the brush settings for gin 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.030
 burn and then I will explain which buttons in not 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.300
 installed and so turn on the brush 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.250
 I have already created a layer for must burn for 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.840
 those who work with a brush gray layer is not 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.180
 need so we can remove it click 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.970
 f5 or window brush opens with us 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.200
 window settings brush from all the tick us 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.190
 need to put only one 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.190
 build up this check mark repeats completely 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.160
 air values brush setting and brushing 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.540
 which turns your brush into an airbrush 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.209
 that is, makes its principle of work so 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.790
 same as instrument clarifier or 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.470
 dimmer that is if you thought that with 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.330
 using the brush work happens 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.970
 somehow different that is using 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.470
 opacity and you ca n't smoothly apply 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.940
 example of dimming or lightening then 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.190
 now you know that there is such a line 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.190
 airbrush which turns the brush on and 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.110
 rogov further we have now settings 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.750
 flow that is, we now do not work with 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.630
 opacity us the main settings is the pressure 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.670
 pen pressure claw just like this 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.769
 happens to airbrush with he has 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.680
 spit the pressure with which he sprays 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.570
 paint and so to set these 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.000
 percentage pretty quickly 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.340
 we need to work with example numbers 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.989
 put push the button 5 here 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.630
 50 percent low 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.390
 push 1 turns on 10 percent 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.870
 press 0 turns on absolutely want 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.450
 to put 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.810
 very small values ​​we need to click 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.690
 Noah and then press the example of 3 of us 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.209
 becomes 3 percent flow let's 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.230
 let's see what 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.810
 my transparency is set to 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.739
 tablet as you can see it is small 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.310
 transparency 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.640
 that is one 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.770
 2 and 3 percent why so because how 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.000
 you have now seen small transparencies 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.450
 enabled by 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.910
 and holding the key 0 and then any 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.280
 numbers for this i need right hand 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.709
 drawn together by a permanent keyboard 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.480
 which is very inconvenient accordingly 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.780
 setting small transparency 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.419
 namely, they work for sd 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.690
 gin stormy accordingly i am very 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.850
 quickly and easily install them with 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.970
 tablets further I have a hundred button 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.270
 percent flow or opacity this button 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.180
 need specific cases let me get you 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.479
 show for example , I have one 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.450
 the percentage of flow and I still need to loosen 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.510
 effect i press shift and pressing to 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.229
 Example 3 turns me on 30 percent 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.260
 opacity 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.850
 till the tassel gets weaker but when 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.280
 I need to return the opacity 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.800
 for this i need to hold shift and 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.310
 then drag the right button 0 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.260
 this is inconvenient so i will render this button 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.750
 on the tablet service clamping shift and 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.990
 press a hundred percent button and graze 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.240
 on the tablet I switched to Assol 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.640
 one hundred percent further I can also 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.610
 quickly change 2 percent 3 percent 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.530
 How much do I need from the tablet, that's all 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.320
 the settings you need for 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.000
 Work should have been setup for the tablet 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.890
 settings in photoshop 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.430
 that's all you can do 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.979
 quality work and not to bother 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.320
 I hope these technical points 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.030
 what video was useful for you if 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.639
 so then like me it will be very 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.169
 nice if you want not to miss 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.110
 further videos which i will 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.020
 create then sign up for this on 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.680
 today, thank you very much for your attention 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.630
 good luck bye 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.940
 on a large increase us right away 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.190
 see the effect as a whole on the picture that is 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.110
 example if it is very important to us 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.980
 glare areas on the eyes were 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.070
 same size 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.220
 that is to say, for example, then we can 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.060
 constantly working with high magnification 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:16.220
 always keep track of everything that happens on 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.220
 picture as a whole in its full scale
