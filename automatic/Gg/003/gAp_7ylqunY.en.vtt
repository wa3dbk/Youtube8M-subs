00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.950 
of it now don't get me wrong it's the
sweet<00:04:22.950> spot<00:04:23.310> all<00:04:23.730> right<00:04:23.910> for<00:04:24.150> tablets<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.780> mean

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
sweet spot all right for tablets I mean

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.500 
sweet spot all right for tablets I mean
it's<00:04:25.110> seven<00:04:25.380> point<00:04:25.590> nine<00:04:25.680> inches<00:04:26.340> all<00:04:27.300> right

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
it's seven point nine inches all right

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.330 
it's seven point nine inches all right
and<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:28.010> 1024<00:04:29.010> x<00:04:29.810> 768<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:31.380> your<00:04:31.800> resolution

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
and it's 1024 x 768 on your resolution

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.980 
and it's 1024 x 768 on your resolution
so<00:04:32.490> it's<00:04:32.610> basically<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.030> same<00:04:33.090> resolution<00:04:33.630> as

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
so it's basically the same resolution as

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.060 
so it's basically the same resolution as
the<00:04:34.740> ipad<00:04:35.190> 2<00:04:35.460> all<00:04:36.150> right<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.810> same

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
the ipad 2 all right and the same

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.950 
the ipad 2 all right and the same
processor<00:04:38.070> same<00:04:38.760> memory<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.360> everything<00:04:39.750> so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
processor same memory and everything so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.620 
processor same memory and everything so
it's<00:04:40.080> basically<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.620> mini<00:04:41.040> ipad<00:04:41.490> 2<00:04:41.760> all<00:04:42.450> right

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
it's basically a mini ipad 2 all right

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.690 
it's basically a mini ipad 2 all right
so<00:04:42.840> for<00:04:43.020> people<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.350> already<00:04:43.590> have<00:04:43.800> their

quad-core GPU and it's going to have a

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.210 
quad-core GPU and it's going to have a
dual<00:05:49.550> core<00:05:49.820> processor<00:05:50.110> we<00:05:51.110> will<00:05:51.410> dual<00:05:51.980> core

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
dual core processor we will dual core

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.030 
dual core processor we will dual core
processor<00:05:52.990> beefed<00:05:53.990> up<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.350> little<00:05:54.650> bit<00:05:54.770> so<00:05:54.950> it

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
processor beefed up a little bit so it

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.840 
processor beefed up a little bit so it
will<00:05:55.190> have<00:05:55.310> an<00:05:55.460> 85<00:05:55.940> X<00:05:56.450> chip<00:05:57.290> instead<00:05:58.190> of<00:05:58.310> the<00:05:58.430> a5

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
will have an 85 X chip instead of the a5

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.260 
will have an 85 X chip instead of the a5
chip<00:05:59.330> that's<00:05:59.720> I<00:06:00.140> believe<00:06:00.740> it's<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.520> a5<00:06:01.880> chip

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
chip that's I believe it's the a5 chip

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.300 
chip that's I believe it's the a5 chip
in<00:06:02.540> the<00:06:02.750> ipad<00:06:03.140> 2<00:06:03.350> no<00:06:03.530> quote<00:06:03.770> me<00:06:03.919> if<00:06:03.980> I'm<00:06:04.100> wrong

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
in the ipad 2 no quote me if I'm wrong

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.750 
in the ipad 2 no quote me if I'm wrong
but<00:06:04.370> I<00:06:04.580> believe<00:06:04.669> it's<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:05.270> a5<00:06:05.750> chip<00:06:06.080> or<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.280> a4

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
but I believe it's the a5 chip or the a4

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.150 
but I believe it's the a5 chip or the a4
chip<00:06:07.790> if<00:06:08.600> i'm<00:06:08.750> not<00:06:08.930> mistaken<00:06:09.110> in<00:06:09.530> the<00:06:09.620> ipad<00:06:09.919> 2

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
chip if i'm not mistaken in the ipad 2

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.760 
chip if i'm not mistaken in the ipad 2
but<00:06:10.760> they're<00:06:10.940> going<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.210> beef<00:06:11.419> it<00:06:11.600> up<00:06:11.720> and<00:06:11.990> make

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
but they're going to beef it up and make

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.330 
but they're going to beef it up and make
