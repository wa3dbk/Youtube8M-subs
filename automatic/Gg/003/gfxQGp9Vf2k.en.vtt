00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
when I did mention in the last video I

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.340 
when I did mention in the last video I
got<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:46.400> with<00:01:46.580> Windows<00:01:46.880> 7<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:48.200> didn't

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
got this with Windows 7 I really didn't

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.260 
got this with Windows 7 I really didn't
want<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.530> do<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.740> whole<00:01:48.830> Windows<00:01:49.159> 8<00:01:49.400> thing<00:01:49.700> yet

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
want to do the whole Windows 8 thing yet

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.789 
want to do the whole Windows 8 thing yet
I'll<00:01:50.780> wait<00:01:50.960> until<00:01:51.049> they<00:01:51.229> get<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.470> all<00:01:51.590> worked

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
I'll wait until they get it all worked

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.859 
I'll wait until they get it all worked
out<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.159> then<00:01:52.250> we'll<00:01:52.460> decide<00:01:53.330> if<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:53.630> like<00:01:53.840> it

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
out and then we'll decide if we like it

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.320 
out and then we'll decide if we like it
or<00:01:54.080> not<00:01:54.200> but<00:01:54.439> I<00:01:54.500> think<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.670> better<00:01:56.060> for

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
or not but I think it's it's better for

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.940 
or not but I think it's it's better for
tablets<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.899> stuff<00:01:57.140> like<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.439> was<00:01:57.560> saying<00:01:57.770> in

keys<00:02:14.209> over<00:02:14.330> here<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.660> that'll<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.870> nice<00:02:15.019> to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
keys over here so that'll be nice to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.360 
keys over here so that'll be nice to
have<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:16.910> seems<00:02:17.330> pretty<00:02:17.510> nice<00:02:17.810> I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
have I think all seems pretty nice I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.130 
have I think all seems pretty nice I
mean<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.269> this<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.569> about<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.750> third<00:02:21.019> of

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
mean for this this is about a third of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.110 
mean for this this is about a third of
the<00:02:21.200> price<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.620> Mac<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.069> look<00:02:22.850> at<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
the price of the Mac and look at the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.670 
the price of the Mac and look at the
quality<00:02:23.299> list<00:02:23.750> comparable<00:02:24.200> has<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> bigger

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
quality list comparable has the bigger

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.100 
quality list comparable has the bigger
screen<00:02:25.480> I'm<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> only<00:02:26.690> thing<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.900> didn't<00:02:27.080> like

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
screen I'm the only thing I didn't like

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.150 
screen I'm the only thing I didn't like
was<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.819> power<00:02:29.480> outlet<00:02:29.780> here<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.739> like<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
was the power outlet here I I like the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.199 
was the power outlet here I I like the
one<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> MacBook<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.910> has<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
one in the MacBook that has like the

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.580 
one in the MacBook that has like the
magnetic<00:02:32.660> thing<00:02:32.840> because<00:02:33.049> I've<00:02:33.170> popped<00:02:33.410> that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
magnetic thing because I've popped that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.190 
magnetic thing because I've popped that
out<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:33.920> many<00:02:34.069> times<00:02:34.340> when<00:02:34.640> using<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.690> it's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
out so many times when using it and it's

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.240 
out so many times when using it and it's
definitely<00:02:36.410> nice<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.069> I'll<00:02:37.130> just

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
definitely nice to have so I'll just

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.229 
definitely nice to have so I'll just
have<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.519> be<00:02:37.610> careful<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.180> one

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
have to be careful with this one

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.000 
have to be careful with this one
probably<00:02:38.989> just<00:02:39.110> use<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.470> when<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:39.860> here

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
probably just use it when it's in here

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.130 
probably just use it when it's in here
on<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.160> desk<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.750> apparently<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.019> gonna

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
on the desk so apparently this is gonna

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.000 
on the desk so apparently this is gonna
looks<00:02:42.350> like<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.560> gonna<00:02:42.650> take<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.890> little

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
looks like it's gonna take a little

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.250 
looks like it's gonna take a little
while<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.280> I'll<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:43.910> cut<00:02:44.540> out<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:44.959> and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
while so I'll just cut out of this and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.259 
while so I'll just cut out of this and
come<00:02:46.250> back<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:46.700> have<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.910> all<00:02:47.030> set<00:02:47.060> up

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.430 

okay<00:02:50.269> like<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.570> second<00:02:50.870> later<00:02:51.019> this<00:02:51.230> came<00:02:51.410> up

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
okay like one second later this came up

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440 
okay like one second later this came up
so<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.489> guess<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:52.820> is<00:02:52.940> just<00:02:52.970> setting<00:02:53.209> up

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
so I guess this is just setting up

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.060 
so I guess this is just setting up
Windows<00:02:53.750> 7<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.959> asking<00:02:57.260> me<00:02:57.320> where<00:02:57.470> I'm<00:02:57.560> from<00:02:57.769> so

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
Windows 7 or asking me where I'm from so

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.420 
Windows 7 or asking me where I'm from so
to<00:02:59.030> make<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.329> user<00:02:59.510> name<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.170> we'll<00:03:00.320> go<00:03:00.470> Greg

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.220 

then<00:03:04.430> computer<00:03:04.850> name<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.840> will<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.140> keep

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
then computer name this will just keep

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.160 
then computer name this will just keep
that<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.560> same<00:03:07.630> works<00:03:08.630> for<00:03:08.750> me

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
that the same works for me

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.949 
that the same works for me
oh<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:13.010> gotta<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.430> my<00:03:13.519> password<00:03:13.970> here<00:03:14.209> we'll<00:03:14.870> be

oh I gotta do my password here we'll be

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.120 
oh I gotta do my password here we'll be

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.580 

ok

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590

for Windows 7 which I guess I'll do I
don't<00:03:30.829> think<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.040> have<00:03:31.130> much<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.459> choice

not too much junk which is one of the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.230 
not too much junk which is one of the
reasons<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:58.220> I<00:05:58.340> wanted<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.700> get<00:05:58.850> this<00:05:59.000> and

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
reasons that I wanted to get this and

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.180 
reasons that I wanted to get this and
apparently<00:06:00.170> down<00:06:00.350> here<00:06:00.530> it's<00:06:00.710> downloading

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
apparently down here it's downloading

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.920 
apparently down here it's downloading
and<00:06:01.310> installing<00:06:01.550> updates<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.880> this<00:06:05.840> is

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
and installing updates and this is

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.760 
and installing updates and this is
asking<00:06:06.260> me<00:06:06.320> if<00:06:06.410> I<00:06:06.530> want<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.710> optimize<00:06:08.770> startup

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
asking me if I want to optimize startup

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.020 
asking me if I want to optimize startup
so<00:06:10.070> I'm<00:06:10.160> not<00:06:10.250> even<00:06:10.310> gonna<00:06:10.520> bother<00:06:10.700> with<00:06:10.970> that

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
so I'm not even gonna bother with that

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.540 
so I'm not even gonna bother with that
for<00:06:11.450> now<00:06:11.590> probably<00:06:12.590> should<00:06:12.920> change<00:06:13.160> the<00:06:13.370> date

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
for now probably should change the date

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.180 
for now probably should change the date
on<00:06:13.730> here<00:06:14.170> make<00:06:15.170> it<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.380> 16th<00:06:15.970> ok<00:06:18.040> all<00:06:19.040> right<00:06:19.070> so

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
on here make it the 16th ok all right so

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:28.070 
on here make it the 16th ok all right so
we<00:06:19.340> got<00:06:19.430> the<00:06:19.520> 16th<00:06:19.910> now<00:06:20.120> instead

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.240 

if<00:06:28.500> it<00:06:28.650> allows<00:06:28.830> me<00:06:29.039> to<00:06:29.129> do<00:06:29.280> it<00:06:30.919> okay<00:06:31.919> there's<00:06:32.129> a

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
if it allows me to do it okay there's a

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.020 
if it allows me to do it okay there's a
16th<00:06:32.729> in<00:06:33.080> me<00:06:34.080> click<00:06:34.289> okay<00:06:36.979> okay<00:06:38.009> and<00:06:38.940> we're

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
16th in me click okay okay and we're

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.170 
16th in me click okay okay and we're
good<00:06:39.150> to<00:06:39.180> go<00:06:39.270> so<00:06:40.159> I<00:06:41.159> guess<00:06:41.340> that<00:06:41.520> concludes<00:06:41.610> the

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
good to go so I guess that concludes the

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.890 
good to go so I guess that concludes the
operating<00:06:43.080> of<00:06:43.289> my<00:06:43.409> computer<00:06:44.750> appreciate<00:06:45.750> you

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
operating of my computer appreciate you

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.559 
operating of my computer appreciate you
tuning<00:06:46.349> in<00:06:46.530> for<00:06:46.740> this<00:06:46.889> and<00:06:47.879> it<00:06:48.000> was<00:06:48.060> probably

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:48.569 
tuning in for this and it was probably

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.390 
tuning in for this and it was probably
somewhat<00:06:48.840> boring<00:06:49.139> but<00:06:49.440> you<00:06:50.039> know<00:06:50.159> I<00:06:50.190> thought

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
somewhat boring but you know I thought

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.770 
somewhat boring but you know I thought
I'd<00:06:50.550> show<00:06:50.759> it<00:06:50.909> since<00:06:51.180> maybe<00:06:51.449> some<00:06:51.659> people

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
I'd show it since maybe some people

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.600 
I'd show it since maybe some people
aren't<00:06:52.080> some<00:06:52.289> computers<00:06:52.710> out<00:06:52.919> there<00:06:52.949> I<00:06:53.340> know

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
aren't some computers out there I know

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.100 
aren't some computers out there I know
I'm<00:06:53.819> excited<00:06:54.030> about<00:06:54.300> trying<00:06:54.509> this<00:06:54.659> out<00:06:54.840> so

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
I'm excited about trying this out so

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.029 
I'm excited about trying this out so
I'll<00:06:55.199> play<00:06:55.349> around<00:06:55.409> with<00:06:55.650> this<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:55.919> maybe

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
I'll play around with this and maybe

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.439 
I'll play around with this and maybe
I'll<00:06:56.159> do<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.310> more<00:06:56.520> thorough<00:06:56.550> review<00:06:57.090> after

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
I'll do a more thorough review after

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.360 
I'll do a more thorough review after
I've<00:06:57.599> used<00:06:57.810> it<00:06:57.960> for<00:06:58.110> a<00:06:58.169> while<00:06:58.250> thanks<00:06:59.250> for

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
I've used it for a while thanks for

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.639 
I've used it for a while thanks for
watching
