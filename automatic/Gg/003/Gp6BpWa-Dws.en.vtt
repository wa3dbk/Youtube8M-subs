00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.080
 glass 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.040

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.250

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.250

 fry the environment warmly and here's the answer in the format 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.990

 when potato pancake say so 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.319
 she fights for pretty on a crust 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.319

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.570
 relatively many skillet 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.950
 the flow envelops the news - the butter of that 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.319
 the pan should not be overloaded on 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.209
