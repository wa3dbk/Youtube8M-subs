00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.140

 red and they were 1 3 euros each 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.540
 I found little ears 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.380
 general and of the day at forever but 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is true that there are many of which 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.820
 as we avoid a little bit overwhelmed 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.969
 small earrings as 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.000
 this I would not want too much 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.590
 they are actually a little talk with 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 some holographic reflections of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.719

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.090
 through and scored 1 euros 45 I found 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.320
 when we went there at first with 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 marry but we found a little high 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 since she too has taken 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.549
 that he took after that is a little bone 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.170
 bambi that I find very cute 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.830
 so it's a sweater with sleeves 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.600
 three quarter and it cost 13 euros 50 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 not go to braemar I'm showing you a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 first tee shirt I bought because 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.210
 that it is dirty game leamy a fake and in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.390
 Besides, my machine jumped on me 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 and had plenty of mud on his legs 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 so the t-shirt lasted ten seconds and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.509
 so that's a tee shirt like that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.680
 ten snow cinderella 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.909

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.740
 I find really pretty and well done 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.049
 it's a t-shirt that was worth it to me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.189

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.220

 here I have taken blacks because 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.799

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.310
 brake since I do not do that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.750

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.870

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.780

 really not what it was cute and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.150
 because I had instagram and because 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.360
 it's soon summer here I've taken a 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 inconceivable a trick to do the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.200
 horny to make the ice balls into 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.690
 ice form like this game 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 this is all stupid but I found it 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.220
 the pretty so I wanted it was worth 2 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.489
 euros so I 'm not too regretful 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.170
 in addition to small tabs that 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:07.799

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.230
 and I think it's nice, it reminds me 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 the summer so the oil notes and they were costing 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.489
 not euros always in the momentum 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.720
 I spice tights because they 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.910
 make pretty cool colors and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.970
 original and not very expensive and there I am 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.670
 am taking mickey tights and minnie 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.609

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.260
 peas and all and valais red and 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.079

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.829

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.799
 to go in euros 50 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.760

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.159
 EUR 0.5 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.959

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:46.060

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.639
 believe it was worth 7 euros something 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.169
 I took for myself my mom a scrub to 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.020
