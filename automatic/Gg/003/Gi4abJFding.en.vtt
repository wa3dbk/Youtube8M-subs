it's<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.600> basic<00:00:33.989> tutorial<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.520> next

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it's the basic tutorial but the next

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.069 
it's the basic tutorial but the next

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
step is where it gets a little fancy

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.569 
step is where it gets a little fancy
next<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> look<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.890> eyes<00:00:41.070> make

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
tilted upwards or downwards because this

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.770 
tilted upwards or downwards because this
can<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> mess<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.600> your

eyeballs and then you want to determine
how<00:00:51.539> long<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.140> crease<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.559> eyelid

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
eye depending on where your eyelid
crease<00:00:57.660> ends<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.500> point<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> way<00:00:58.980> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
crease ends you can point the way more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639

towards<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> Taylor<00:01:00.300> eyebrow<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
towards the Taylor eyebrow but the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
towards the Taylor eyebrow but the
further<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.100> crease<00:01:02.399> extends<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.300> to
