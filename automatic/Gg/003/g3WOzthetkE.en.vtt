00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
know so that does happen I think

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.550 
know so that does happen I think
photography<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:01.180> general<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> lie<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.530> know

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
photography in general is a lie you know

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.490 
photography in general is a lie you know
I<00:03:02.650> don't<00:03:03.040> think<00:03:03.220> there's<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.489> truthful<00:03:04.239> picture

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
I don't think there's a truthful picture

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.080 
I don't think there's a truthful picture
because<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.890> just<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.220> split<00:03:06.459> second<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
because it's just a split second and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.080 
because it's just a split second and
capturing<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.230> souls<00:03:08.560> overused<00:03:09.489> terms<00:03:09.880> I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
capturing the souls overused terms I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.920 
capturing the souls overused terms I
always<00:03:10.299> find<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.900> very<00:03:11.080> very<00:03:11.500> cheesy<00:03:11.950> and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
always find it very very cheesy and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.380 
always find it very very cheesy and
pretentious<00:03:13.930> because<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.590> person<00:03:15.549> sometimes

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
pretentious because a person sometimes

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.110 
pretentious because a person sometimes
sad<00:03:16.870> sometimes<00:03:17.200> happy<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:18.070> picture<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:18.910> picks

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
sad sometimes happy a picture just picks

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.900 
sad sometimes happy a picture just picks
one<00:03:19.359> single<00:03:19.840> moment<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.709> their<00:03:21.340> life

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
one single moment in their life

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.000 
one single moment in their life
and<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.450> split<00:03:22.720> second<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.380> certain<00:03:23.739> kind<00:03:23.859> of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
and a split second in a certain kind of

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.280 
and a split second in a certain kind of
lighting<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.609> then<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.420> photographer<00:03:25.570> edits

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
lighting and then the photographer edits

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.930 
lighting and then the photographer edits
the<00:03:26.500> film<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:26.920> finds<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.340> frame<00:03:27.579> that<00:03:27.790> they

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the film and finds the frame that they

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.449 
the film and finds the frame that they
think<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:29.410> person<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.890> they<00:03:30.040> don't<00:03:30.220> even

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
think of a person that they don't even

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.849 
think of a person that they don't even
know<00:03:30.790> does<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.239> person<00:03:31.570> justice<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.799> a

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
know does that person justice so it's a

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.150 
know does that person justice so it's a
very<00:03:33.100> subjective<00:03:34.530> Enterprise<00:03:35.530> photography

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
very subjective Enterprise photography

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.509 
very subjective Enterprise photography
but<00:03:36.730> within<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.269> realm<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:38.340> photography<00:03:39.340> I

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
but within that realm of photography I

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.370 
but within that realm of photography I
think<00:03:39.850> there's<00:03:40.030> pictures<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:41.019> have<00:03:41.109> maybe<00:03:41.290> a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
think there's pictures that have maybe a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.050 
think there's pictures that have maybe a
little<00:03:41.470> bit<00:03:41.620> more<00:03:41.769> honest<00:03:42.160> than<00:03:42.220> others<00:03:42.609> you

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
little bit more honest than others you

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.640 
little bit more honest than others you
know<00:03:43.150> anything<00:03:43.600> necessarily<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.170> much<00:03:44.320> truth

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
know anything necessarily so much truth

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.560 
know anything necessarily so much truth
but<00:03:45.280> maybe<00:03:45.519> they're<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.730> little<00:03:45.850> bit<00:03:46.000> closer<00:03:46.299> to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
but maybe they're a little bit closer to

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.069 
but maybe they're a little bit closer to
