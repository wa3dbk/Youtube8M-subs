now<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.090> trying<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.750> figure<00:02:34.709> out<00:02:34.920> more<00:02:35.129> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
now I'm trying to figure out more and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.920 
now I'm trying to figure out more and
more<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.550> learn<00:02:35.700> more

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
more and learn more

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.500

program but so far it works very good
it's<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.930> lot<00:02:40.109> a<00:02:40.680> lot<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.159> function<00:02:41.579> it's<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:42.469> so

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
it's a lot a lot of function it's a so

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.440 
it's a lot a lot of function it's a so
much<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:44.209> learn<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:47.040> see<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.579> power<00:02:48.060> in

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
much to learn and I can see the power in

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.099 
much to learn and I can see the power in
