00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all guys and welcome back to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.120
 this new video tutorial on photoshop 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.290
 for digital photography 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.480
 in this video I will explain how 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.759
 make with your photos of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.440
 beautiful planets like this the idea is 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.730
 very pretty and the process is very 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.289
 simple so let's see right away how to do it 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 the first thing to say when we go to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 creating this effect is necessary 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 have a panoramic photo like this one 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 important thing is that the width is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.130
 greater than the height of at least two 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 times 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 it must be said that it is perfect for photos a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.160
 360 degrees then as I did in a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.200
 previous tutorial going to merge 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 all the photos taking a panorama 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 we can have a 360 degree photo that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.520
 lends itself very well to this thing if 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.170
 you do not have a 360 degree picture 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.850
 care don't worry i'll explain 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 then how do we start 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.360
 immediately, however, this is simpler 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.610
 so at least you have an idea of ​​how to do it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.289
 click on image and go up 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.300
 image size in this panel 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.180
 we must remove keep proportions and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 go to enter a height equal to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.810
 width then in this case 5767 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 pixel and how you see our image 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 is resized in square form 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.030
 now to make the effect good 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
 outcome we must go to flip 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.040
 the image then with rotation images 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 180 degrees and we are upside down 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.979
 let's go to distortion filter now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.170
 polar coordinates and without touching anything 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.170
 we left rectangular in polar and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.210
 we press ok 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.220
 as you can see it was bullshit doing 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.100
 our photo but it was very simple 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.170
 because I used a 360 degree photo 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.439
 where the horizon was perfectly 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.840
 linear and where the two sides of the photo are 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.369
 they matched perfectly to see how 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.649
 simple now we can also go to 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.680
 rotate our photo as more 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.030
 we prefer and it was very simple not 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.060
 there is nothing to change now you can 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.400
 simply change colors 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.280
 exposure 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.320
 if you want but if we don't have a photo 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.880
 at 360 degrees but we have a simple one 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.700
 panorama or a simple photo we can 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.850
 anyway have this effect I'll explain 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.630
 like this is a picture I took from 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.330
 a website for screen wallpapers and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.990
 we can try to create a planet 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.700
 with this photo 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.740
 I chose this photo because the tower 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.390
 eiffel being very tall soars in 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.460
 our sky and will create an effect 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 similar to this skyscraper we have 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.020
 then seen in the previous photo 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.820
 things that rise in the sky like 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.330
 direct skies like trees and stuff 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.300
 various 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.370
 they will then go to compose the exterior of the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.020
 our planet while the line 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.630
 of the horizon that this will be more or 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.580
 minus the water line in this case 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.350
 another thing to keep in mind 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.150
 when we go to perform this effect 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.490
 is that the bottom of the photo 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.540
 determines how much that will be great 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.040
 our planet 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.680
 for example our horizon was 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.540
 in the other three quarters of the photo we would have 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.060
 a planet that is as big as 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
 virtually all of our image and 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.140
 the effect would not be the one you want 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.350
 so let's use photos where 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.030
 the horizon is below the del line 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.580
 center of the photo and also look for 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.769
 keep the horizon the most linear 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.239
 possible and horizontal does not have to be 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.160
 higher from a lower part from the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.860
 other otherwise to the creation of 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.810
 planet will practically crack 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.269
 take the cutter tool e 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.760
 click on straighten what we take 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 the tallest of the buildings and the part 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.330
 left we join it to the highest 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.450
 of the palaces of the right side that the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:39.030
 photo will be slightly rotated so 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:43.090
 to have the buildings at the same height 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.820
 we click on in God we cut the photo 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.980
 and now we go to redo the same 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.260
 procedure and this is our result 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.630
 as you can see as I said before the tower 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.540
 eiffel is gigantic and stands out in the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.180
 our photo and the line is marked 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.340
 where the photo has been merged because 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.140
 extremes of the photo did not coincide 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.580
 so we have some work to do 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.070
 first of all we turn over 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.360
 this image because I want the tower 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:13.050
 above and let's just go 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.090
 learn the lasso tool 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.780
 we select this part where not 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.990
 coincides and we modify and fill in 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.250
 based on the content itself itself 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.320
 what for the inside of the planet if 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.610
 the effect is very marked let's go to 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.030
 first duplicate this level 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.090
 because I didn't apologize, do it yourself 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.880
 and with the lasso we go to take the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.620
 line of union of the levels we modify 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.710
 with filled ok and lowers the opacity a bit 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.300
 of this level 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.520
 ok this is our final effect 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.070
 as you can see we also have the exterior of the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.600
 our planet to modify we take 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.700
 the ellipse tool select 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.210
 the upper left corner e 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.040
 select the lower right corner 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.450
 we move the selection if it is not if not 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.190
 coincides with our planet 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.970
 select the reverse and go to 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.350
 fill in as we did before though 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.040
 the effect of the sc is not yours 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.570
 liking 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.180
 the planet is too small we can 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.890
 simply go and cut the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.220
 our image as we did before 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.840
 this time we try to keep the tower e 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.250
 our photo in this way I would tell him 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.940
 that this effect did not come did 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.560
 bad we look at another photo as I have 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.450
 said first the larger the space 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.580
 below the horizon the largest will be the 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.470
 our planet so I go to 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.010
 zoom out I take the tool 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:46.390
 rectangular selection and cutting into 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:50.880
 this image mode crops and how 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:54.580
 first I go to enter the dimensions 79 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.040
 image rotation image of the filter 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.570
 polar coordinates 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.700
 I must say that this came very well 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.550
 because the details of our photos 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.610
 there were no clouds and therefore they were not 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.500
 the cut ones are created new and then also the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.690
 center of our image 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.760
 well ok as before there are the corners from 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:17.650
 modify and simply arrived at 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.980
 cut originals since there are 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.350
 clouds put my world down a 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.540
 left 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.310
 this way 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.070
 ok this planet has been done too 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.880
 one thing with a disarming simplicity 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.980
 what you can do 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.340
 they don't flip your image 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.800
 after having resized it you can have 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.380
 an inverse effect or with the planet 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.120
 outside and the sky inside in 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.980
 this way where it seems to look at 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.870
 photo through a tunnel looks like of 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.380
 exit from alice in the land of 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.660
 wonders 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.790
 I thank you for watching this 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.230
 new video tutorial plate this video 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.390
 you enjoyed it because this effect is 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.190
 particularly cute and I recommend you 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.630
 try using it at least once for 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.230
 see a little what comes out of 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.480
 your photos 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.480
 thanks again and hello to the next video
