something browser here so when we have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the browser open up here on these two

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
the browser open up here on these two
devices<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:28.920> one<00:00:29.130> clear<00:00:29.670> thing<00:00:29.699> here

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
devices we can see one clear thing here

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
devices we can see one clear thing here
we<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.900> immediately<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.000> galaxy<00:00:33.000> s5

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
we see immediately is that the galaxy s5

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.479 
we see immediately is that the galaxy s5
goes<00:00:33.809> me<00:00:34.050> into<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> sort<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
goes me into a sort of like a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.060 
goes me into a sort of like a
full-screen<00:00:36.030> mode<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.800> taking

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
full-screen mode so it's taking

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.639 
full-screen mode so it's taking
advantage<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> whole<00:00:39.000> screen<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
advantage of the whole screen and the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
advantage of the whole screen and the
browser<00:00:41.219> looks<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.790> more<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
browser looks a little bit more like the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.040 
browser looks a little bit more like the
Google<00:00:42.510> Chrome<00:00:42.719> browser<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.140> Android<00:00:44.809> on<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
Google Chrome browser for Android on the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
Google Chrome browser for Android on the
iPhone<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:47.039> you're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
iPhone when you're going down to see the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
iPhone when you're going down to see the
website<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.200> could<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.559> nice

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
website up here which could be very nice

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
website up here which could be very nice
I<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:51.090> left<00:00:51.449> unless<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I kind of like it also left unless you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
I kind of like it also left unless you
see<00:00:52.110> still<00:00:52.649> everything<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> battery

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
see still everything like the battery

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.939 
see still everything like the battery
life<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> such<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:55.530> again<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
life and and such but then again the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.029 
life and and such but then again the
display<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.370> pretty<00:00:56.699> small<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.859> maybe<00:00:58.859> they

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
display is pretty small so maybe they

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
display is pretty small so maybe they
would<00:00:59.969> maybe<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> would<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.379> they

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
would maybe it would be good if they

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
would maybe it would be good if they
tried<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> mess<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> off<00:01:02.309> even<00:01:02.820> even<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> little

better<00:02:33.860> system<00:02:34.400> there<00:02:35.080> when<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.230> go<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.620> and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
better system there when we go in and

out here you can see I have to stretch a
lot<00:02:39.290> here<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.830> go<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.280> little<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:42.940> well<00:02:43.940> it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
lot here to go in a little bit well it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.570 
lot here to go in a little bit well it
looks<00:02:44.300> pretty<00:02:44.390> familiar<00:02:44.780> here<00:02:45.290> still<00:02:46.280> think

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
looks pretty familiar here still think

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.730 
looks pretty familiar here still think

even<00:02:51.260> though<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.620> smooth<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.640> both<00:02:52.880> these

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
even though it's smooth on both these

even though it's smooth on both these
two<00:02:53.360> devices<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:54.730> something<00:02:55.730> with<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> touch

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
two devices but something with the touch

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.300 
two devices but something with the touch
like<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.110> feels<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.710> little<00:02:57.740> bit<00:02:58.040> sharper

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
like the feels just a little bit sharper

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.350 
like the feels just a little bit sharper
here<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.560> on<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.830> iPhone<00:03:01.220> that's<00:03:02.030> that's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
here on the on the iPhone that's that's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.630 
here on the on the iPhone that's that's
why<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.540> like<00:03:02.840> iPhones<00:03:03.380> as<00:03:03.530> well<00:03:03.740> a<00:03:03.770> lot<00:03:04.010> even

improvements on their latest omellete
display<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.840> was<00:03:20.990> really<00:03:21.740> really<00:03:21.890> white

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390

display it was really really white
compared<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.570> even<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.530> iPhone<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.570> the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
compared to even the iPhone and the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.420 
compared to even the iPhone and the
iPhone<00:03:26.660> 5s<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.440> looks<00:03:27.590> more<00:03:27.830> White's<00:03:28.070> the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
iPhone 5s it looks more White's the

colors and everything and that can

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.140 
colors and everything and that can
probably<00:03:30.110> be<00:03:30.380> pretty<00:03:30.590> awesome<00:03:30.800> especially<00:03:31.640> in

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
probably be pretty awesome especially in

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.300 
probably be pretty awesome especially in
some<00:03:32.360> kind<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.570> reading<00:03:32.780> mode<00:03:34.240> so<00:03:35.240> yeah<00:03:36.310> you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
some kind of reading mode so yeah you

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.210 
some kind of reading mode so yeah you
can<00:03:37.430> see<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.760> tab<00:03:38.030> system<00:03:38.300> here<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.350> personally

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
can see the tab system here I personally

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.700 
can see the tab system here I personally
would<00:03:40.570> enjoy<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.750> little<00:03:41.900> bit<00:03:42.020> more<00:03:42.290> here<00:03:42.530> on

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
would enjoy it a little bit more here on

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.820 
would enjoy it a little bit more here on
the<00:03:42.830> iPhone<00:03:43.300> because<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.720> feels<00:03:45.080> loops<00:03:45.590> more

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
the iPhone because it feels loops more

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.920 
the iPhone because it feels loops more
fluid<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:47.330> instantly<00:03:47.870> pops<00:03:48.350> up<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:49.600> had<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.720> wait

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
fluid it instantly pops up I had to wait

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.900 
fluid it instantly pops up I had to wait
like<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.650> millisecond<00:03:52.250> or<00:03:52.310> something<00:03:52.730> before

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
like a millisecond or something before

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.550 
like a millisecond or something before
it<00:03:53.180> pops<00:03:53.330> up<00:03:53.570> there<00:03:53.840> on<00:03:54.830> on<00:03:55.760> Android<00:03:56.240> so

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
it pops up there on on Android so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.600 
it pops up there on on Android so
overall<00:03:57.560> would<00:03:57.770> say<00:03:57.950> actually<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
overall would say actually that the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.170 
overall would say actually that the
iPhone<00:03:59.090> clearly<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.780> winner<00:04:00.080> here<00:04:00.380> so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
iPhone clearly is the winner here so

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.440 
iPhone clearly is the winner here so
yeah

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
yeah

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.320 
yeah
quickly<00:04:02.960> look<00:04:03.140> here
