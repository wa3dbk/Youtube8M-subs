00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.769 
inflatable kayaks there happen to be
from<00:00:18.240> West<00:00:18.510> Marine<00:00:19.670> they're<00:00:20.670> great<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:21.300> pack

from West Marine they're great they pack
down<00:00:21.810> into<00:00:22.529> basically<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.279> medium<00:00:23.880> sized

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
my buddy of mine bought a hard kayak and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.900 
my buddy of mine bought a hard kayak and
he<00:00:42.120> added<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> rod<00:00:42.809> holder<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.489> was

he added a rod holder and it really was

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.200 
he added a rod holder and it really was
a<00:00:45.450> great<00:00:46.260> addition<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.280> rod<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.910> out

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a great addition because the rod got out

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.410

reel especially and kept the dirt out of
there<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> big<00:00:55.800> key<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> was

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that you see at the front of the boat

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.120 
that you see at the front of the boat
there<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.840> ability<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> rod

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.350 
there and the ability to have a rod
holder<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.220> big<00:01:38.430> improvement<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
holder and it's it's a big improvement I

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.170 
holder and it's it's a big improvement I
didn't<00:01:40.259> find<00:01:40.439> anything<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> web<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.939> had

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
didn't find anything on the web that had

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
didn't find anything on the web that had
any<00:01:42.390> any<00:01:42.810> such<00:01:44.390> items<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:46.079> inflatable

everything's<00:01:47.040> about<00:01:47.189> hard<00:01:47.430> kayaks<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
everything's about hard kayaks so as you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.410 
everything's about hard kayaks so as you
can<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.210> there's<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.689> base<00:01:51.930> unit<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can see there's the base unit there the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
can see there's the base unit there the
base<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> unit<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> attached<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:55.920> three

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
base of the unit is attached with three

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.130 
base of the unit is attached with three
screws<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.149> added<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.520> liquid<00:01:59.520> nails<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
screws I added some liquid nails to it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.370 
screws I added some liquid nails to it
but<00:02:01.740> nothing<00:02:02.100> sticks<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> polyethylene<00:02:03.380> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
but nothing sticks to polyethylene and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
but nothing sticks to polyethylene and
did<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.610> did<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> seal<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
did more it did it more for a seal I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
did more it did it more for a seal I
guess<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:08.690> that's<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.869> problem<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.500> kind

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
guess but that's the problem that's kind

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.230 
guess but that's the problem that's kind
of<00:02:10.920> was

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
of was

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.370 
of was
a bit<00:02:11.390> of<00:02:11.420> trouble<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.200> what<00:02:12.350> I

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
a bit of trouble and this is what I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.860 
a bit of trouble and this is what I
figured<00:02:12.740> out<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.040> do<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:14.240> be<00:02:14.450> able<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.660> attach

spare<00:02:55.700> pieces<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.270> wood<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.750> had<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.350> I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
spare pieces of wood that I had and I

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.510 
spare pieces of wood that I had and I
cut<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.580> basic<00:02:59.150> size<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.980> cooler<00:03:01.340> itself

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
cut to to a basic size the cooler itself

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.630 
cut to to a basic size the cooler itself
is<00:03:02.210> 13<00:03:02.870> by<00:03:03.320> 9<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> half<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.340> that's<00:03:04.430> why<00:03:04.610> I

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
is 13 by 9 and a half so that's why I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640 
is 13 by 9 and a half so that's why I
made<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.970> with<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.480> unit<00:03:05.990> nine<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.440> half

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
made the with the unit nine and a half

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.360 
made the with the unit nine and a half
and<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.820> an<00:03:08.000> island<00:03:08.180> breeze<00:03:08.690> Igloo<00:03:09.230> cooler

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
and it is an island breeze Igloo cooler

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.250 
and it is an island breeze Igloo cooler
here<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.520> can<00:03:10.670> see<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.090> three<00:03:11.390> holes<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.200> I

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
here you can see the three holes that I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.970 
here you can see the three holes that I
drilled<00:03:12.890> i<00:03:13.820> pre-drilled<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.200> base<00:03:15.470> and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
drilled i pre-drilled in the base and

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.040 
drilled i pre-drilled in the base and
that<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.550> kind<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.880> an<00:03:17.000> important<00:03:17.510> thing<00:03:17.780> that

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
that is kind of an important thing that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.130 
that is kind of an important thing that
I<00:03:18.080> figured<00:03:18.440> out<00:03:18.740> how<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.150> how<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.180> attach<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
I figured out how to how to attach it so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.050 
I figured out how to how to attach it so
what<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.320> did<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.680> lined<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.190> up<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
what I did is I lined it up on the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.180 
what I did is I lined it up on the
cooler<00:03:23.480> where<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.690> wanted<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.200> be<00:03:24.350> once<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.070> was

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
cooler where I wanted to be once it was

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.970 
cooler where I wanted to be once it was
mounted<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:26.270> took<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.660> same<00:03:26.930> drill<00:03:27.320> bit

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
mounted and I took that same drill bit

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.220 
mounted and I took that same drill bit
which<00:03:28.190> was<00:03:28.400> three<00:03:29.210> thirty-seconds<00:03:30.050> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
which was three thirty-seconds and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.620 
which was three thirty-seconds and
drilled<00:03:30.680> through<00:03:31.040> those<00:03:31.280> holes<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:32.000> into<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
drilled through those holes and into the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.600 
drilled through those holes and into the
first<00:03:32.870> layer<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.410> cooler<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.070> red<00:03:34.310> part

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
first layer of the cooler the red part

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.270 
first layer of the cooler the red part
of<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.760> cooler<00:03:35.030> not<00:03:35.300> through<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.660> inside

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
of the cooler not through the inside

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.790 
of the cooler not through the inside
then<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.310> took<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.910> larger<00:03:38.540> drill<00:03:38.780> bit<00:03:39.020> 3/8<00:03:39.500> drill

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
then I took a larger drill bit 3/8 drill

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.320 
then I took a larger drill bit 3/8 drill
bit<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.930> widened<00:03:41.930> those<00:03:42.080> holes<00:03:42.410> out<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:43.330> what

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
bit and widened those holes out and what

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.470 
bit and widened those holes out and what
I<00:03:44.360> used<00:03:44.660> was<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.930> number<00:03:45.350> eight<00:03:45.500> 5/8<00:03:46.480> Phillips

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
head screw and here you can see I used a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.990 
head screw and here you can see I used a
soldering<00:03:51.110> gun<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.920> kind<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.250> make<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> keyhole

soldering gun to kind of make a keyhole
shape<00:03:53.360> on<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:54.820> on<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.090> holes<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:56.630> I'm<00:03:56.750> going

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
shape on the on the holes that I'm going

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.750 
shape on the on the holes that I'm going
to<00:03:56.960> insert<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.380> screws<00:03:57.860> in<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.190> there<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.730> see

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
to insert the screws in so there you see

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.790 
to insert the screws in so there you see
those<00:03:59.210> five<00:03:59.630> eighths<00:04:00.280> number<00:04:01.280> eight<00:04:01.460> Phillips

screws<00:04:03.800> there<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:05.410> what's<00:04:06.410> going<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.620> happen

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
screws there and what's going to happen

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.650 
screws there and what's going to happen
is<00:04:07.160> you're<00:04:07.430> gonna<00:04:07.490> leave<00:04:07.790> just<00:04:08.060> enough<00:04:08.390> room

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
is you're gonna leave just enough room

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.470 
is you're gonna leave just enough room
to<00:04:09.050> slide<00:04:09.410> those<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.520> through<00:04:10.970> those<00:04:11.209> holes

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
to slide those in through those holes

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.390 
to slide those in through those holes
and<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.020> slide<00:04:12.380> them<00:04:12.590> down<00:04:12.650> into<00:04:13.190> that

and then slide them down into that

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.660 
and then slide them down into that
keyhole<00:04:13.910> area<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:14.990> burned<00:04:15.380> out<00:04:15.830> with<00:04:16.400> that

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
keyhole area that I burned out with that

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.390 
keyhole area that I burned out with that
solder<00:04:17.420> gun<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.560> that's<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:19.070> thick<00:04:19.370> enough

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
solder gun and that's just thick enough

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.210 
solder gun and that's just thick enough
to<00:04:19.940> get<00:04:20.180> into<00:04:20.690> there<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.169> slide<00:04:21.530> down<00:04:21.560> there's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
to get into there and slide down there's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.970 
to get into there and slide down there's
the<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.870> adhesive<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.470> I

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
the the adhesive that I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.650 
the the adhesive that I
used<00:04:25.190> again<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.820> don't<00:04:26.090> think<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.360> really<00:04:26.480> do

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
used again I don't think you really do

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.900 
used again I don't think you really do
make<00:04:26.780> much<00:04:27.020> difference<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:28.430> put<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.850> on

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
make much difference so I put it on

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.780 
make much difference so I put it on
there<00:04:29.090> i<00:04:29.150> clamped<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.830> just<00:04:31.250> just<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:31.730> you

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
there i clamped it but just just so you

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.520 
there i clamped it but just just so you
know<00:04:31.880> when<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.270> put<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.570> on<00:04:32.660> it's<00:04:32.810> really<00:04:33.170> it's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
know when you put it on it's really it's

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.350 
know when you put it on it's really it's
got<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.830> be<00:04:33.920> really<00:04:34.100> snug<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.850> slide<00:04:35.090> down

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
got to be really snug to slide down

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.640 
got to be really snug to slide down
because<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.690> screws<00:04:35.990> are<00:04:36.170> really<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.530> only

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
because the screws are really the only

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.190 
because the screws are really the only
thing<00:04:36.890> that's<00:04:36.920> holding<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.550> in<00:04:37.670> there<00:04:37.940> on<00:04:38.390> the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
thing that's holding it in there on the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.660 
thing that's holding it in there on the
other<00:04:39.380> side<00:04:39.710> of<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:39.980> cooler

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
other side of the cooler

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.460 
other side of the cooler
I<00:04:40.700> sewed<00:04:41.710> from<00:04:43.060> Harbor<00:04:44.060> Freight<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.780> was<00:04:45.170> able

end of it the leash portion there was a
little<00:04:53.120> webbing<00:04:53.420> and<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:54.380> cut<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:54.920> in<00:04:55.010> half<00:04:55.280> and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
little webbing and I cut it in half and

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.140 
little webbing and I cut it in half and
I<00:04:55.850> sewed<00:04:56.150> one<00:04:56.450> half<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.110> cooler<00:04:57.500> there<00:04:57.710> and

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
I sewed one half to the cooler there and

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.560 
I sewed one half to the cooler there and
to<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.270> handle<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.930> kept<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.970> on<00:05:01.970> there<00:05:02.480> and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
to the handle and kept that on there and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.750 
to the handle and kept that on there and
then<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.810> other<00:05:03.050> half<00:05:03.380> had<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.800> d-ring

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
then the other half had a d-ring

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.740 
then the other half had a d-ring
on<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.720> sewed<00:05:06.110> that<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.820> floor<00:05:08.390> of

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
on it and I sewed that to the floor of

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.660 
on it and I sewed that to the floor of
the<00:05:08.980> kayak<00:05:10.390> and<00:05:11.410> was<00:05:12.410> able<00:05:12.620> obviously<00:05:13.430> move

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
the kayak and was able obviously move

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.670 
the kayak and was able obviously move
the<00:05:13.910> inflated<00:05:14.540> area<00:05:15.110> there<00:05:15.320> so<00:05:15.470> it<00:05:15.530> wouldn't

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
the inflated area there so it wouldn't

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.700 
the inflated area there so it wouldn't
punch<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.980> hole<00:05:16.130> but<00:05:17.000> that's<00:05:17.840> able<00:05:18.230> to<00:05:18.260> keep<00:05:18.560> it

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
punch a hole but that's able to keep it

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.100 
punch a hole but that's able to keep it
from<00:05:18.830> tilting<00:05:19.370> when<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:19.610> put<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:19.880> fishing<00:05:20.840> rod

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
from tilting when you put a fishing rod

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.080 
from tilting when you put a fishing rod
and<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.770> rod<00:05:21.950> holder<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.520> keeps<00:05:22.730> it<00:05:22.910> from

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
and the rod holder it keeps it from

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.720 
and the rod holder it keeps it from
tilting<00:05:23.690> backwards<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:25.340> just<00:05:25.490> kind<00:05:25.670> of

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
tilting backwards and you just kind of

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.540 
tilting backwards and you just kind of
measured<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.240> out<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.680> there<00:05:27.920> you<00:05:28.040> see<00:05:28.310> the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
measured that out so there you see the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.530 
measured that out so there you see the
finished<00:05:29.210> product<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:31.280> a<00:05:31.910> couple<00:05:32.270> of<00:05:32.360> shots

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
finished product and a couple of shots

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.470 
finished product and a couple of shots
of<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.080> it's<00:05:33.200> really<00:05:33.380> worked<00:05:33.620> out<00:05:33.770> well

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
of it and it's really worked out well

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.610 
of it and it's really worked out well
gives<00:05:35.480> you<00:05:35.600> some<00:05:35.810> place<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.050> put<00:05:36.200> your<00:05:36.320> rod<00:05:36.590> and
