00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 was we reiterated the last concert of 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 celina there we see her 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.889
 I imagine if I'm not wrong with some 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.580
 clothes that we had never seen him before 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.109
 that we had never seen yesterday 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 unknown to us 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 attire he did exclusively for this 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.960
 concert that was as it says on 11 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 March initially that concert was 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.689
 for bronco and other groups like mandingo 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 and failed but feline had no other 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.369
 available date then they put them together 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 bronco did two two-hour concerts 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.070
 and celine only 30 minutes and there 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 we have the first problem then what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 that told them at the beginning that it was one 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 of the saddest days perhaps because in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.500
 that moment you look at it was ascending 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 quickly to the peak of popularity 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.059
 he had bought himself in the heart of thousands 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.969
 and thousands of fans across the nation 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 her obviously her fame had pierced 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.910
 also the borders of the states 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.039
 united there you start to cheer up a bit 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.390
 people if you are not that place us know 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.770
 what places where it is located in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.080
 chicago towards that is the amphitheater 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.730
 international precisely where is the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.890
 Mexican neighborhood la villita 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.260
 is very close there and good if the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.180
 people were a bit passive at the beginning 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.460
 afterwards she already encouraged herself in that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.790
 time I was promoting the issue not 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.270
 I still have more with mariachi 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.130
 is that this topic and there was a lot of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.530
 a problem to record why we 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.720
 we went back because in this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.720
 Accompanied by her uncle 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.820
 then at that time by position 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 cut the video is by canvas is a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.080
 unique style scoop we can 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.370
 nothing connecting me 25 seconds 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.770
 they put that we will have the cassette 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.020
 original not yes clear we have the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 images like you crave in principle and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.460
 I was about to go on stage and everyone 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.990
 we should be sad you know enrique but in 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.330
 the part where you already talk to the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 public and tells them what's happening to them 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.530
 that's why they are asleep what he says there 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.800
 they are asleep what is happening to them 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.260
 the same thing we already had this before that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.940
 a little before that but different 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.039
 cultures in their transactions between 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.439
 they forbidden love 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.049
 since the call can show off 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.879
 and then people started talking and 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.980
 is encouraging a little more so that 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.750
 go more lively good ladies and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.030
 gentlemen this is a scoop style 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.219
 only the last concert to follow this 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.920
 Video has absolutely nothing and 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:31.230
 the world including his dad abraham 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.849
 quintanilla was interested in having 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.159
 these images of course we do not have 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.250
 no clear problem imagined bandaging 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.159
 there will be gypsy so you have that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.739
 I remember that memory because after 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:47.819
 the worst came after less was 19 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.489
 days exactly 19 days after 20 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.959
 days after seeing we no longer have 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.569
 absolutely no document other than 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.579
 what you just saw said that 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.930
 I was sad because the comments from 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.599
 the daily media 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.159
 next in the diaries about everything 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.950
 what stood out most was the performance of 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.940
 bronco that had even exceeded the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.280
 interest 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.740
 of the fans that met in that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.540
 place to do they paid more attention to 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.600
 bronco that makes life and the mentioned 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.790
 coordinates the concert was not the most 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.310
 effusive of people not as I pointed out 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.770
 in the film that was to them 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.900
 it was the star where houston but not the 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.600
 last was in chicago and precisely 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.460
 celina was that occasion is the means of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.380
 the two concerts of the information that 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.210
 we corroborate with the lord 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.570
 abraham quintanilla who obviously the 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.940
 Celine dad can have this this 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.660
 video at your disposal when he is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.660

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.079

 Y 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.510
 i 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.680
