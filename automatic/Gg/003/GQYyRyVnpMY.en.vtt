why<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.599> lost<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.110> game<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:09.739> for<00:03:10.069> novice

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
why I lost that game I think for novice

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.710 
why I lost that game I think for novice
players<00:03:10.579> going<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.819> be<00:03:10.940> awesome<00:03:11.060> i<00:03:11.390> actually

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
players going to be awesome i actually

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.850 
players going to be awesome i actually
think<00:03:11.870> maybe<00:03:12.110> some<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.470> really<00:03:12.590> hardcore

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
think maybe some of the really hardcore

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.229 
think maybe some of the really hardcore
pro<00:03:13.250> players<00:03:13.519> are<00:03:13.700> probably<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:14.030> going<00:03:14.090> to

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
pro players are probably not going to

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.509 
pro players are probably not going to
like<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.510> future<00:03:14.840> because<00:03:15.190> once<00:03:16.190> somebody

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
like the future because once somebody

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.100 
like the future because once somebody
has<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.700> good<00:03:16.970> technique<00:03:17.329> for<00:03:17.540> scoring<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:17.989> high

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
has a good technique for scoring on high

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.900 
has a good technique for scoring on high
ground<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.530> example<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.459> whole<00:03:19.610> world<00:03:19.819> is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
ground for example the whole world is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.009 
ground for example the whole world is
going<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.060> know<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.239> technique<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.870> now

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
going to know that technique and now

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.360 
going to know that technique and now
we're<00:03:21.200> all<00:03:21.319> going<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.590> use<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.769> sand<00:03:22.010> exact

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
we're all going to use the sand exact

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.339 
we're all going to use the sand exact
method<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.269> think<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:23.930> gonna<00:03:24.019> level<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
method so I think it's gonna level the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.920 
method so I think it's gonna level the
playing<00:03:24.530> field<00:03:24.620> in<00:03:25.010> some<00:03:25.250> ways

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.959 

I<00:03:30.989> think<00:03:31.709> two<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:31.980> most<00:03:32.129> important

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:32.969 
I think two of the most important

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.149 
I think two of the most important
features<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:33.989> we've<00:03:34.140> added<00:03:34.379> into<00:03:34.709> halo<00:03:34.920> 3

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
features that we've added into halo 3

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.880 
features that we've added into halo 3
multiplayer<00:03:35.489> are<00:03:36.290> definitely<00:03:37.290> equipment<00:03:37.769> and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
multiplayer are definitely equipment and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.500 
multiplayer are definitely equipment and
then<00:03:38.069> there's<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.430> new<00:03:40.280> type<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.329> weapon<00:03:42.329> class

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
then there's a new type of weapon class

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.209 
then there's a new type of weapon class
that<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:42.900> call<00:03:43.079> support<00:03:43.349> weapons<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.069> that's

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:44.219 
that we call support weapons and that's

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:45.800 
that we call support weapons and that's
you<00:03:44.790> know<00:03:44.819> you'll<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.209> guys<00:03:45.420> running<00:03:45.750> around

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
you know you'll see guys running around

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.410 
you know you'll see guys running around
with<00:03:46.140> turrets<00:03:46.530> or<00:03:46.709> missile<00:03:47.370> pod<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:48.120> camera

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
with turrets or missile pod the camera

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.940 
with turrets or missile pod the camera
actually<00:03:48.599> goes<00:03:48.930> third<00:03:49.230> person<00:03:49.680> for<00:03:49.829> that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
actually goes third person for that

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.860 
actually goes third person for that
because<00:03:50.159> these<00:03:50.459> things<00:03:50.670> are<00:03:50.849> deadly<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.389> move

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
because these things are deadly you move

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.569 
because these things are deadly you move
around<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.319> little<00:03:52.439> bit<00:03:52.620> slower<00:03:52.950> your<00:03:53.370> tone

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
around a little bit slower your tone

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.069 
around a little bit slower your tone
back<00:03:53.819> a<00:03:53.849> little<00:03:54.090> bit<00:03:54.299> but<00:03:54.540> you've<00:03:54.750> got<00:03:54.930> this

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
back a little bit but you've got this

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.349 
back a little bit but you've got this
really<00:03:55.290> crazy<00:03:55.829> deadly<00:03:56.400> weapon<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:56.849> your<00:03:56.879> hands

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
really crazy deadly weapon in your hands

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.360 
really crazy deadly weapon in your hands
it<00:03:57.870> adds<00:03:58.109> this<00:03:58.290> new<00:03:58.500> layer<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.889> Halo<00:03:59.280> 3

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
it adds this new layer to Halo 3

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.879 
it adds this new layer to Halo 3
multiplayer<00:03:59.819> that<00:04:00.319> we<00:04:01.319> obviously<00:04:01.500> haven't

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
multiplayer that we obviously haven't

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.039 
multiplayer that we obviously haven't
seen<00:04:02.010> before<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.419> takes<00:04:03.659> an<00:04:03.810> encounter

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
seen before but it it takes an encounter

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.659 
seen before but it it takes an encounter
and<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.379> kind<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.650> tips<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.189> balance<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.639> little

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
and it kind of tips the balance a little

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.369 
and it kind of tips the balance a little
bit<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.060> doesn't<00:04:06.329> make<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.659> guy<00:04:06.780> who<00:04:06.840> uses<00:04:07.139> the

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
bit it doesn't make the guy who uses the

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.740 
bit it doesn't make the guy who uses the
equipment<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:08.400> winner<00:04:08.639> in<00:04:08.939> Sony<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.510> just

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
equipment the winner in Sony it just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.629 
equipment the winner in Sony it just
makes<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.200> re-evaluate<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:11.040> encounter<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
makes you re-evaluate the encounter and

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:25.570 
makes you re-evaluate the encounter and
I<00:04:11.669> think<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:11.970> makes<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.480> game<00:04:12.659> really<00:04:13.470> cool

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.950 

this<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.699> just<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:26.970> beta<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.449> we<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.870> know

what<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.680> future<00:04:49.979> holds<00:04:50.220> for<00:04:50.280> munji<00:04:50.610> we're

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
what the future holds for munji we're

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:51.680 
what the future holds for munji we're
definitely<00:04:50.880> had<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> pretty<00:04:51.510> interesting

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
definitely had a pretty interesting

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.930

immediate<00:04:54.840> priority<00:04:55.289> is<00:04:55.349> obviously<00:04:55.710> just

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
immediate priority is obviously just

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.950 
immediate priority is obviously just
getting<00:04:56.130> halo<00:04:56.280> 3<00:04:56.550> done<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.599> best<00:04:57.780> game<00:04:57.930> we

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
getting halo 3 done and the best game we

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.230 
getting halo 3 done and the best game we
can<00:04:58.169> possibly<00:04:58.320> make<00:04:58.800> what<00:04:59.310> really<00:04:59.669> separates

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
can possibly make what really separates

what we do with Peter Jackson in Halo

universe is going to be different from

universe is going to be different from
what<00:05:19.850> we've<00:05:20.000> done<00:05:20.150> in<00:05:20.300> halo<00:05:20.480> 1<00:05:20.750> 2<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.110> 3<00:05:21.140> as

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
what we've done in halo 1 2 and 3 as

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.680 
what we've done in halo 1 2 and 3 as
well<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.980> it's<00:05:22.700> all<00:05:22.820> about<00:05:23.000> developing<00:05:23.540> the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
well and it's all about developing the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.390 
well and it's all about developing the
property<00:05:23.900> hopefully<00:05:24.470> doing<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.980> in<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.130> right

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
property hopefully doing it in the right

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.610 
property hopefully doing it in the right
way<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:26.450> that<00:05:26.480> it<00:05:26.720> becomes<00:05:26.840> something<00:05:27.350> that's

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
way so that it becomes something that's

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.080 
way so that it becomes something that's
much<00:05:27.860> greater<00:05:28.190> than<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.520> sum<00:05:28.670> of<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.910> parts

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
much greater than the sum of the parts

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.940 
much greater than the sum of the parts
we're<00:05:29.780> going<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:29.960> be<00:05:30.050> careful<00:05:30.440> about<00:05:30.590> how<00:05:30.920> we

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
we're going to be careful about how we

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.890 
we're going to be careful about how we
grow<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.610> universe<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.210> how<00:05:32.300> we<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:32.810> know

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
grow the universe and how we you know

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.360 
grow the universe and how we you know
what<00:05:33.050> kinds<00:05:33.350> of<00:05:33.410> titles<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.830> we<00:05:34.040> do<00:05:34.190> that

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
what kinds of titles that we do that

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.400 
what kinds of titles that we do that
because<00:05:34.490> it's<00:05:35.390> not<00:05:35.510> something<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:35.990> we<00:05:36.230> want

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
because it's not something that we want

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.160 
because it's not something that we want
to<00:05:36.560> just<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:37.520> know<00:05:37.610> try<00:05:37.850> to<00:05:37.880> monetize<00:05:38.660> as

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
to just you know try to monetize as

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.510 
to just you know try to monetize as
quickly<00:05:39.470> as<00:05:39.710> we<00:05:39.830> possibly<00:05:39.860> can<00:05:40.340> we're

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
quickly as we possibly can we're

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.250 
quickly as we possibly can we're
building<00:05:40.850> a<00:05:40.940> really<00:05:41.120> great<00:05:41.240> long-term<00:05:41.660> asset

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
building a really great long-term asset

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.370 
building a really great long-term asset
so<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.520> game<00:05:43.700> is<00:05:43.730> halo<00:05:44.180> 3<00:05:44.480> it's<00:05:44.720> coming<00:05:45.230> out

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
so the game is halo 3 it's coming out

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.140 
so the game is halo 3 it's coming out
fall<00:05:45.820> 2007<00:05:46.820> on<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.270> xbox<00:05:47.660> 360
