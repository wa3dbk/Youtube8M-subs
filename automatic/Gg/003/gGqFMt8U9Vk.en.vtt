as the cargo plane that I showed you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.550 
as the cargo plane that I showed you
guys<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.640> believe<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> other<00:02:22.630> day<00:02:22.840> make<00:02:23.530> sure

you<00:02:23.739> guys<00:02:23.830> check<00:02:23.890> out<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.459> plane<00:02:24.700> that's<00:02:24.910> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you guys check out that plane that's a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.960 
you guys check out that plane that's a
also<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> very<00:02:25.840> beautiful<00:02:26.020> plane<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:27.400> notice

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
also a very beautiful plane and I notice

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.580 
also a very beautiful plane and I notice
right<00:02:28.180> here<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.599> after<00:02:28.930> getting<00:02:28.959> into<00:02:29.290> this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
right here that after getting into this

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.610 
right here that after getting into this
plane<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.250> facing<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.030> wrong<00:02:31.330> way<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.560> you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
plane is facing the wrong way so you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.900 
plane is facing the wrong way so you
might<00:02:32.739> want<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.950> grab<00:02:33.069> one<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> other<00:02:33.670> ones

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
might want to grab one of the other ones

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.059 
might want to grab one of the other ones
that<00:02:34.000> are<00:02:34.150> actually<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> runway<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.830> have

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
that are actually on a runway that have

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.590 
that are actually on a runway that have
room<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.700> take<00:02:36.940> off<00:02:37.120> because<00:02:37.480> this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
room for you to take off because this

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360 
room for you to take off because this
one<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.840> Eve<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.110> turn<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.620> do<00:02:39.040> all<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.310> stuff

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
one I Eve the turn and do all this stuff

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.640 
one I Eve the turn and do all this stuff
but<00:02:39.910> overall<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> 747<00:02:41.290> from

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
but overall it's just like a 747 from

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.199 
but overall it's just like a 747 from
the<00:02:41.739> single<00:02:42.010> player<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.730> pretty<00:02:42.970> cool

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
the single player and it's pretty cool

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.620 
the single player and it's pretty cool
very<00:02:43.870> very<00:02:44.170> big<00:02:44.380> I've<00:02:44.590> actually<00:02:44.890> seen<00:02:45.400> people

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
very very big I've actually seen people

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.500 
very very big I've actually seen people

mod this into GTA online in a regular
session<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.200> no<00:02:50.530> idea<00:02:50.860> how<00:02:50.980> they<00:02:51.130> did<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
session I have no idea how they did it I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.190 
session I have no idea how they did it I
don't<00:02:52.030> recommend<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.569> do<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.959> I'm<00:02:53.080> not

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.420 
don't recommend you do that I'm not
really<00:02:53.380> sure<00:02:53.500> they<00:02:53.769> did<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.069> you<00:02:54.310> can

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
really sure they did it but you can

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280 
really sure they did it but you can
probably<00:02:54.700> get<00:02:54.790> banned<00:02:55.000> from<00:02:55.150> GTA<00:02:55.480> online<00:02:55.510> for

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
probably get banned from GTA online for

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.289 
probably get banned from GTA online for
doing<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.620> stuff<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.280> use<00:02:58.030> these

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
doing that stuff so just use these

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.759 
doing that stuff so just use these
vehicles<00:02:58.630> while<00:02:59.049> they're<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.560> mission

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
vehicles while they're in this mission

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.800 
vehicles while they're in this mission
have<00:03:00.100> fun<00:03:00.340> with<00:03:00.489> them<00:03:00.610> do<00:03:01.239> what<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.540> want<00:03:01.660> to

have fun with them do what you want to
do<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.200> actually<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:03.010> think<00:03:03.100> this<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.880> bigger

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
do and actually I think this is bigger

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.809 
do and actually I think this is bigger
than<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.690> ones<00:03:04.930> from<00:03:05.230> single<00:03:05.799> player<00:03:06.010> because

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
than the ones from single player because

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.039 
than the ones from single player because
there's<00:03:07.030> one<00:03:07.269> from<00:03:07.450> single<00:03:07.750> player<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
there's one from single player the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.930 
there's one from single player the
yellow<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.380> right<00:03:08.410> there<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.610> thing<00:03:09.880> is

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
yellow one right there and this thing is

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.259
