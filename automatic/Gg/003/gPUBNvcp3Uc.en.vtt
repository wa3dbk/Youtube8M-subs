00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello guys how are you today 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.459
 I want to talk to you about my dystopias 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.909
 favorite contemporaries so 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.129
 prepared a list of five books that 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:18.619
 They are like the ones I liked the most 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.599
 this last time you already know that this 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.449
 theme of dystopias is nothing new 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.910
 there are many books that speak to us 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.449
 about dystopian worlds either in a 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.490
 city in particular or others basically 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.020
 is a genre that I really like to read 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.879
 and the first book that I am going to show you 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.340
 it's about running a die 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.280
 written by jim stars net this is a 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.100
 trilogy opposed by running or dying of 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.960
 Fire tests the pure deadly virus 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 lethal that would come doing the prequel and 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.769
 there is a separate book called the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 records of my runner I think that it 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.539
 call something like this is this foot is one of 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.670
 the first ones that I read the year before 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.920
 happened if I'm not wrong 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.390
 has a very original idea that was 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.000
 basically for what I liked 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.370
 very much talks to us about some guys 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.780
 who are in an area and do not know why 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.000
 they are there 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.369
 you remember nothing of his past only 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.250
 how they are called and want to continue from that 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.619
 place because there is nothing more than them 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.990
 living in that place only men 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:23.420
 who are between 16 or 14 and 18 20 years old 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.040
 out there is a very original idea and I 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.930
 would like to recommend just in case 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.180
 he has read the other book that I 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.020
 I would like to talk to you would be partiers 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.869
 written by tan webs this a book are 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.880
 a trilogy I think I felt that I know that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.149
 second book if you call fragments or 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.130
 fragments this has already translated into 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.560
 Spanish to which Chile has not arrived there is no 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.440
 publication date still and this 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.110
 book basically captivated me because 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.720
 possesses apart from all that is the idea 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.300
 dystopian and that has a very 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.140
 little girl that basically deals with the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.500
 growth of the human population and is 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 the most clip and there could be in all 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.950
 the book 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.479
 so that point called me a lot the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.489
 attention and it was like what I loved 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 to be able to finish the book the other 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.110
 book that I wanted to talk to you about is about 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 zinder written by marissa mayer no 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.230
 I have my copy of that book because 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.910
 I pay but I'll let the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.130
 cover here so you can look at it 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.290
 now this book tells us the story 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.660
 cinderella but mixed with all 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.459
 what is dystopia and a little bit of 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.780
 science fiction because it has many 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:36.230
 robots has side wars and other things 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.030
 and although we already know and know 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.060
 very well the story of Cinderella the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.580
 theme of the shoe and all that the book does not 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.290
 stop surprising how you mix these 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.530
 three things that the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 dystopia science fiction and the story 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.330
 of fairy from the Cinderella this book if 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.730
 I'm not mistaken, it's the first of a 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.250
 trilogy called lunar chronicles that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.860
 is composed of without him by scarlett and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.230
 why do you think it's something like that 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.299
 pronounces scarlett treats the story of 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.700
 little red riding hood and believes it's about the 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.890
 rapunzel's story there is no cover for 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.620
 the last book but I think it came out 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 cover page 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.220
 where it is but I'll leave here 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.040
 because the other book is precious 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.650
 I wish to speak is a book that already 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.170
 a lot of people know or have even 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.730
 heard about him and have seen both 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.770
 movies that I'm talking about right now 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.200
 of the Hunger Games' written by 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.300
 susan collins this book is the first 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.590
 of a trilogy the trilogy of the 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.390
 Hunger Games' which is composed 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.970
 for the games of famine in flames and 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.530
 Mockingjay this book is one of my 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.630
 favorite stories basically because 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.660
 the author knew how to mix very well what 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.790
 it was this authoritarian world together with the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.770
 reality show and finally wanted 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.260
 show them this book that is about 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.330
 laws written by mary lu is a 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.820
 trilogy that is composed of laws 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.190
 prodigy and champions in this world 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.400
 dystopian the boys right they have to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.560
 give a test that they are taking scores 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.300
 and they think that from a certain contagion 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.640
 upwards you will have better education 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.160
 better the university is better jobs 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.160
 and will live in a population sector 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.740
 much richer than the people who 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.120
 have the score from a certain amount 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.790
 until further down 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.040
 they're going to be just workers and they're going to be 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.639
 very poor and live in a kind of jet 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.440
 or the grace of this book is that it's all 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.990
 this of the republic that is how it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.449
 call the place or as it is called the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.320
 government is not as perfect as what 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.490
 they say they are and for some reason they do not 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.830
 I'm going to say because if it would not be a 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.620
 spoiler there is a has to find the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.970
 law that is one of the most 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.970
 sought by the republic 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.850
 because they say he is a killer who steals 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.910
 and that sells things on the black market and 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.740
 I do not know what and that's what my books have been 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.850
