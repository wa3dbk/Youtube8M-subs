00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.879 
traditional sport whether it's soccer or
basketball

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
basketball

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.470 
basketball
so<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.430> means<00:03:30.579> we<00:03:30.730> better<00:03:30.970> figure<00:03:31.150> out<00:03:31.269> how<00:03:31.420> to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
so it means we better figure out how to

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.119 
so it means we better figure out how to
bring<00:03:31.690> all<00:03:31.870> these<00:03:32.049> other<00:03:32.230> people<00:03:32.470> into<00:03:32.950> what

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
bring all these other people into what

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.699 
bring all these other people into what
is<00:03:33.250> essentially<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:34.090> one-to-one<00:03:34.780> space<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.590> so

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
is essentially a one-to-one space and so

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.050 
is essentially a one-to-one space and so
over<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.129> years<00:03:36.159> there<00:03:36.579> have<00:03:36.670> been<00:03:36.730> lots<00:03:36.940> of

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
over the years there have been lots of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.180 
over the years there have been lots of
different<00:03:37.359> ways<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.659> doing<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.190> broadcast

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
different ways of doing this broadcast

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.369 
different ways of doing this broadcast

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.719 

the<00:05:37.930> eSports<00:05:38.379> community<00:05:38.590> needs<00:05:39.219> to<00:05:39.460> really

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
the eSports community needs to really

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.119 
the eSports community needs to really
confront<00:05:40.270> in<00:05:40.569> a<00:05:40.659> serious<00:05:41.080> way<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.650> grapple

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
confront in a serious way and grapple

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.219 
confront in a serious way and grapple
with<00:05:42.159> real<00:05:42.759> problems<00:05:43.330> if<00:05:43.659> it<00:05:43.779> wants<00:05:44.199> to

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
with real problems if it wants to

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.379 
with real problems if it wants to
continue<00:05:44.800> growing<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:45.430> bringing<00:05:45.999> new<00:05:46.150> people

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
continue growing and bringing new people

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.629 
continue growing and bringing new people
in<00:05:46.779> it<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.379> male-dominated<00:05:48.009> right<00:05:48.249> now<00:05:48.400> and

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
in it is male-dominated right now and

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.760 
in it is male-dominated right now and
sexism<00:05:49.300> is<00:05:49.539> something<00:05:49.900> that<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.319> scene<00:05:50.589> in

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
sexism is something that the scene in

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.709 
sexism is something that the scene in
the<00:05:50.860> community<00:05:51.339> struggle<00:05:51.999> with<00:05:52.180> there<00:05:52.509> are

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:52.719 
the community struggle with there are

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.600 
the community struggle with there are
structural<00:05:53.379> problems<00:05:53.439> that<00:05:53.800> keep<00:05:54.099> women<00:05:54.309> out

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
structural problems that keep women out

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.489 
structural problems that keep women out
I<00:05:54.939> think<00:05:55.089> that<00:05:55.300> community<00:05:55.809> has<00:05:56.050> tended<00:05:56.469> to

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:56.499 
I think that community has tended to

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:58.739 
I think that community has tended to
support<00:05:57.219> itself<00:05:57.520> in<00:05:57.759> turn<00:05:57.969> inward<00:05:58.419> kind<00:05:58.659> of

00:05:58.739 --> 00:05:58.749 
support itself in turn inward kind of

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.049 
support itself in turn inward kind of
take<00:05:58.930> pride<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.289> their<00:05:59.589> own<00:05:59.770> outsider<00:06:00.400> status

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:01.059 
take pride in their own outsider status

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:02.249 
take pride in their own outsider status
and<00:06:01.270> I<00:06:01.300> think<00:06:01.539> one<00:06:01.689> of<00:06:01.809> the<00:06:01.870> things<00:06:02.080> that's

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
and I think one of the things that's

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.140 
and I think one of the things that's
happening<00:06:02.650> now<00:06:02.800> is<00:06:03.009> computer<00:06:03.639> gaming<00:06:03.849> has

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
happening now is computer gaming has

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.179 
happening now is computer gaming has
really<00:06:04.569> just<00:06:04.779> become<00:06:05.110> a<00:06:05.139> mainstream<00:06:05.770> leisure

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
really just become a mainstream leisure

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.999 
really just become a mainstream leisure
activity<00:06:06.759> and<00:06:06.999> so<00:06:07.569> the<00:06:07.930> eSports<00:06:08.319> community<00:06:08.889> is

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
activity and so the eSports community is

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.040 
activity and so the eSports community is
having<00:06:09.249> to<00:06:09.550> transition<00:06:10.509> into<00:06:10.749> what<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.020> means

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
having to transition into what it means

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.559 
having to transition into what it means
from<00:06:11.409> going<00:06:11.680> from<00:06:11.919> geek<00:06:12.159> subculture<00:06:13.089> to

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
from going from geek subculture to

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.600 
from going from geek subculture to
something<00:06:13.960> actually<00:06:14.169> hundreds<00:06:15.099> of<00:06:15.219> thousands

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
something actually hundreds of thousands

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.670 
something actually hundreds of thousands
of<00:06:15.669> people<00:06:16.060> may<00:06:16.360> be<00:06:16.389> participating<00:06:16.870> in<00:06:17.439> but<00:06:17.620> I

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
of people may be participating in but I

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.559 
of people may be participating in but I
think<00:06:17.979> you<00:06:18.099> know<00:06:18.189> the<00:06:18.310> people<00:06:18.490> who<00:06:18.879> are<00:06:19.270> very

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
think you know the people who are very

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.379 
think you know the people who are very
interested<00:06:19.930> in<00:06:20.289> growing<00:06:20.680> eSports<00:06:21.669> tend<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.240> be

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
interested in growing eSports tend to be

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.239 
interested in growing eSports tend to be
really<00:06:22.930> dedicated<00:06:23.169> and<00:06:23.680> passionate<00:06:23.830> about

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 
really dedicated and passionate about

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.850 
really dedicated and passionate about
improving<00:06:24.879> eSports<00:06:25.479> competitions<00:06:26.289> I<00:06:26.529> think

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
improving eSports competitions I think

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.379 
improving eSports competitions I think
if<00:06:26.949> the<00:06:27.069> community<00:06:27.430> can<00:06:27.669> sort<00:06:27.939> out<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.270> get

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
if the community can sort out and get

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.879 
if the community can sort out and get
through<00:06:28.509> this<00:06:28.719> growing<00:06:29.020> pain<00:06:29.409> of<00:06:29.589> being<00:06:29.830> a

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
through this growing pain of being a

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.339 
through this growing pain of being a
