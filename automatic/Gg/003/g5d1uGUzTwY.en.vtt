hey what's up today let me teach you
guys<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.460> front<00:00:02.730> side<00:00:02.970> pop<00:00:03.000> shove<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:06.230> all

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.680 
guys how to front side pop shove it all
right<00:00:07.500> well<00:00:08.030> it's<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.090> little<00:00:09.240> harder<00:00:09.599> than

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
right well it's a little harder than

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060 
right well it's a little harder than
backside<00:00:10.139> shove<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.650> my<00:00:10.769> opinion

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
backside shove it's in my opinion

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.209 
backside shove it's in my opinion
because<00:00:11.900> instead<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.960> being<00:00:13.620> able<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.980> jump

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
because instead of being able to jump

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.029 
because instead of being able to jump
forward<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:15.350> it'll<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.410> easier<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.890> jump

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
forward with it it'll be easier to jump

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.050 
forward with it it'll be easier to jump
forward<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.609> got<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.760> worry<00:00:17.970> about

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
forward but you got to worry about

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.750 
forward but you got to worry about
jumping<00:00:18.510> backwards<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.400> for<00:00:20.400> frontside

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
jumping backwards with it for frontside

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340 
jumping backwards with it for frontside
shove<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.289> more

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
shove it so it's a little more

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.859 
shove it so it's a little more
complicated<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.269> practice<00:00:24.390> it's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
complicated but with some practice it's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.620 
complicated but with some practice it's
really<00:00:25.170> not<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.529> hard<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.820> sit<00:00:27.599> your

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
