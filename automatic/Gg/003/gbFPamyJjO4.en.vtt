Hi, my name is Konzi! Today, well will tell you...

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.380
...how to shoot a curve free kick.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.000
The boot doesn't really matter.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.260
I just started wearing the adidas F50.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.900
I'm looking forward to the future.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.200
The ball doesn't really matter, too.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.860
We play with different balls in different competitions.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.800
We switch a lot - but most of the time it's an adidas ball.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.060
So, it matches witch the boots.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.640
Usually I take a run-up of three to four steps.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.080
Not much more.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480
I don't need a long run-up.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.660
It's more about the technique than power.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.780
The run-up should be at 45 degrees. Maybe even less.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.680
You should definitely use the inside of the boot.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.780
So, somewhere around here.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.880
The middle of the inside.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.540
Don't touch it too far at the back or front.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.060
I try to hit the ball quite low.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.220
Not in the middle but more at the outside.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.780
As a righty I hit it at the bottom right outside.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.620
So, I create a good curve

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.620
for the ball to spin into the goal.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:29.540
First of all you have to place the ball on a plane surface.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.200
So, I always try to find a good spot for the ball.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.780
Then, I place my left foot next to the ball

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.120
and take four steps back.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.340
Now, I start running with my left foot.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.560
At least it was a goal!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.820
I would suggest you to take your time for preparation.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.920
Focus on hitting the ball perfectly.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.320
Try to develope your individual run-up.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.000
Then, skill comes with practice.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.060
Still, you should not over-practice taking free kicks.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:08.700
If you do it to often, you overthink it and get too eager.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.020
So, I don't practice too often.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.840
Ten to fiveteen shots a day should be good practice.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.700
Also do other exercises in between.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:35.600
Then, you can become better step by step!

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.880
