00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
mount but seeing they couldn't figure

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
mount but seeing they couldn't figure
out<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.400> way<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.810> weld<00:01:24.810> something<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.229> there

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

that<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> mount<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.210> decided

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that I have to make a mount I decided

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.859 
that I have to make a mount I decided
just<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.100> chunk<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.390> angle<00:01:30.390> iron<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
just to use a chunk of angle iron like

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.880 
just to use a chunk of angle iron like
this<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.909> cut<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.740> one

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
side plus vault I about an inch off the

side plus vault I about an inch off the
other<00:01:39.930> side<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:41.490> shove<00:01:41.759> down<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> can

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
other side then shove down there you can

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
other side then shove down there you can
paint<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> I'll<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.409> get<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.690 
paint and see it I'll see you get a
better<00:01:43.860> shot<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> other<00:01:44.880> side<00:01:46.700> yeah

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
better shot of it on the other side yeah

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
better shot of it on the other side yeah
there<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.060> go<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.439> weld<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> on

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
there you go see then just weld it on

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
there you go see then just weld it on
the<00:01:50.070> inside<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> playing<00:01:51.630> strong<00:01:51.899> enough<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the inside is playing strong enough so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.550 
the inside is playing strong enough so
two<00:01:52.950> bolts<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.909> than<00:01:54.060> enough<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> yeah

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
two bolts or more than enough so yeah

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.639 
two bolts or more than enough so yeah
she's<00:01:55.890> held<00:01:56.130> into<00:01:56.340> place<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> little

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
she's held into place it is a little

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.830 
she's held into place it is a little
close<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> exhaust<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.000> i<00:02:00.030> probably<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.689> have

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
close to exhaust so i probably will have

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.539 
close to exhaust so i probably will have
to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.500> fiberglass<00:02:01.979> stuff<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
to get some of that fiberglass stuff and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
how to make a piece of wood for a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.220 
how to make a piece of wood for a
bearing<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.300> keep<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.599> shaft<00:02:36.959> from

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
bearing for the to keep the shaft from

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.330 
bearing for the to keep the shaft from
moving<00:02:37.560> around<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.630> yeah<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.989> got<00:02:40.980> corvair

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
moving around and yeah I got corvair

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.729 
moving around and yeah I got corvair
steering<00:02:41.790> wheel<00:02:41.940> here<00:02:42.440> seeing<00:02:43.440> as<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.680> is

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
steering wheel here seeing as this is

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.610 
steering wheel here seeing as this is
metric<00:02:44.250> though<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:44.970> barely<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:46.049> too<00:02:46.319> big

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
metric though it just barely is too big

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.890 
metric though it just barely is too big
so<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.840> put<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> little

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
so I think if I just put a little

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.340 
so I think if I just put a little
sandpaper<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.920> teeth<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
sandpaper on the teeth of the for the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.320 
sandpaper on the teeth of the for the
column<00:02:52.980> here<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.310> should<00:02:53.549> fit<00:02:53.790> right<00:02:53.850> onto

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
column here it should fit right onto

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.100 
column here it should fit right onto
this<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.049> just<00:02:55.380> about<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> scene<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:57.110> I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
this so it's just about the scene and I

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.640 
this so it's just about the scene and I
guess<00:02:58.349> here<00:02:58.709> if<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.890> couldn't<00:02:59.220> see<00:02:59.250> last<00:02:59.610> time

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
guess here if you couldn't see last time

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.870 
guess here if you couldn't see last time
last<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.799> described<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.370> master<00:03:02.730> cylinder

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
last I described the master cylinder

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.339 
last I described the master cylinder
this<00:03:03.299> is<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.569> was<00:03:03.630> talking<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:04.080> what

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
and now with this i found a little

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.190 
and now with this i found a little
problem<00:03:08.150> i'm<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.330> getting<00:03:09.540> very<00:03:09.660> much<00:03:09.780> brick

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
problem i'm not getting very much brick

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.050 
problem i'm not getting very much brick
my<00:03:10.680> brakes<00:03:10.920> engine<00:03:11.099> do<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.730> me<00:03:11.880> much<00:03:12.000> good

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
my brakes engine do you do me much good

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.780 
my brakes engine do you do me much good
when<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:14.040> pedal<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.459> touching<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
when I the pedal is touching the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.300 
when I the pedal is touching the
steering<00:03:15.660> column<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.829> have<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.160> is

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
steering column so what I have to do is

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.560 
steering column so what I have to do is
I'll<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.579> cut<00:03:17.760> off<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.880> one<00:03:18.180> side<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
I'll to cut off the one side of the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.130 
I'll to cut off the one side of the
pedal<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.260> look<00:03:19.470> goofy<00:03:19.769> but<00:03:20.130> i<00:03:20.870> don't<00:03:21.870> care<00:03:22.109> i

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
pedal it look goofy but i don't care i

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.910 
pedal it look goofy but i don't care i
guess<00:03:22.549> but<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.609> yeah<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> guess<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.680> about

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
guess but I yeah so I guess that's about

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.250 
guess but I yeah so I guess that's about
all<00:03:26.040> I've<00:03:26.370> gotten<00:03:26.700> done<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.180> far<00:03:30.109> other<00:03:31.109> than

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
that so yeah I mean that not having that

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.410 
that so yeah I mean that not having that
front<00:03:35.190> spring<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.579> killing<00:03:35.910> me<00:03:36.030> because<00:03:36.120> even

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
front spring is killing me because even

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.240 
front spring is killing me because even
if<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.600> find<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:37.079> within<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.890> next<00:03:38.040> day<00:03:38.220> or

it as of two weeks ago but uh nothing I
can<00:06:09.930> do<00:06:10.020> about<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.669> so<00:06:11.669> I<00:06:12.120> guess<00:06:12.750> that's

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
can do about that so I guess that's

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.700 
can do about that so I guess that's
probably<00:06:14.419> bought<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.659> for<00:06:15.840> now<00:06:15.990> I'm<00:06:16.260> doing<00:06:16.620> as

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
probably bought it for now I'm doing as

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.719 
probably bought it for now I'm doing as

much as I can and uh yeah the other than
that<00:06:20.909> it's<00:06:21.449> going<00:06:21.840> good<00:06:22.169> it's<00:06:22.500> just<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.370> don't

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
that it's going good it's just I don't

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.960 
that it's going good it's just I don't
have<00:06:23.669> the<00:06:23.729> parts<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:25.740> stuff<00:06:25.860> so<00:06:27.590> yeah<00:06:28.590> I<00:06:28.620> guess

have the parts and stuff so yeah I guess

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.779 
have the parts and stuff so yeah I guess
until<00:06:29.970> next<00:06:30.270> time<00:06:30.539> then<00:06:31.460> which<00:06:32.460> is<00:06:32.610> going<00:06:32.729> to
