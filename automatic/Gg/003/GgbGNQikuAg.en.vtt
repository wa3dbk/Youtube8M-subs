00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.250
 November 9, 2014 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
 as you can easily notice we are standing in front 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.330
 my brandenburg gate in berlin 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.490
 behind my back you see a chain of whites 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.889
 balls that are in place former 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 berlin wall and reach through the whole 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.340
 the city can be just against to fly in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.930
 white balls across town and see 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.460
 that the berlin wall was pretty 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.410
 extended and divided the city into two parts 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 today celebrates a holiday 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 reunification of germany and it is very me 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 like but on the other hand there 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 events thoroughly soaked 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.870
 by hypocrisy and lie on to as you can see 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.250
 they spent a lot of money 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 here is decorated with the brandenburg gate 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.469
 there side is the same rice so and there 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 behind the buildings of the administration of the chancellor we 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 celebrate the reunification of germany and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 rejoice at this but we forget 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.149
 that the reunification of germany would be 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.559
 impossible not only without peaceful 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.719
 citizens revolutions gdr 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.239
 but it would have been impossible without a decision 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 The USSR is not America supported 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.559
 reunion of the German people it was 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.750
 Russia Russians then said it was good 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.210
 we let go of gdr which was then 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.000
 a member of the Warsaw bloc we let go 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 rdr west there rdr can 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.880
 reunited with vr go off the army was 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.820
 then part of nato and gdr and fgr already together 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350
 become a member of nato but for this nato 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 should expand and stay in volume 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.479
 frozen state in which on 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.310
 was in 1989 to this Russian west 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.299
 said cool ideas thanks thank you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.520
 Russians for trust 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.650
 but about this trust wiped your feet it is possible 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.869
 today say with confidence after 25 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.210
 years because nato during this time is not 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.100
 only expanded to 12 countries but also 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 going to take Ukraine and Georgia about 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.150
 what is being negotiated and here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 today 25 years after 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.560
 German reunions Russians 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 Russia and Putin appear here as 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.860
 the last scoundrel who in no way 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
 case can not be trusted i find it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.909
 disgusting when here for the celebration 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 25th anniversary of the fall of Berlin 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.630
 walls don't pronounce a single word about 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.189
 that we should be grateful for 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 this holiday including Russian 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.030
 because without their permission then not 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 there would be no reunification of Germany 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.020
 after all the Russians could tell no we 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.759
 we do not want this but thanks 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.810
 Russian no speech today we celebrate 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.710
 this anniversary with our american 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.479
 friends 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.009
 by you because they allegedly connected you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.600
 both germany but Americans are not 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.580
 of course they did then 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.170
 during the process of reunification instead of raghim 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.240
 then became against the wall and said mr 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 Gorbachev to level this wall with earth yes 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600
 so then the Americans said Russian 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 must remove the wall and they will not 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.739
 interfere with the fact that we have imposed sanctions today 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.480
 against Russia it is so to speak 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.610
 the form of gratitude is ours 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.730
 thanks to the Russians for giving us 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.500
 Germany then trust if we 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.400
 Remember what we have done in Russian 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 World War II 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.190
 remembering this does not hurt 27 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 million dead Russians in the account 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.850
 Nazi Germany but today it is not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 plays absolutely no role on 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.600
 celebration reunion germany 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.590
 on the contrary today Russians cannot be trusted 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.940
 and we impose sanctions against Russia 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.560
 Angel Chancellor Merkel more than others 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.239
 enters for sanctions while she generally 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.580
 could not have been chancellor if not 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.870
 there was a reunion gdr and frg and the same 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.180
 the most relevant to today 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.890
 federal presidents daw who 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.810
 also from the GDR and that from morning to evening 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.110
 just busy telling everyone 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.600
 On Russia these two people mayor colleague 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.000
 Well, they are from the GDR and they both have enough 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.160
 dark past in their personal affairs like me 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.560
 there seems to be dark places here 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.360
 in the west hide so it seems to me these 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.799
 two people today do not say wait we do not 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.959
 We will celebrate this anniversary without 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.209
 politicians from russia but no they passed 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.370
 on the side of the Americans and why not 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.440
 because we all know that the United States auditioned 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.850
 phone standards so she says let's 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.600
 impose sanctions against Russia 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.190
 and when mister klitschko came to us 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.440
 recently came to us as 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.030
 mayor of Kiev and here he was talking to 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.100
 Chancellor Merkel and asked her to help 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.150
 money to build a new wall 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.150
 between Ukraine and Russia 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.350
 but listen this is complete absurdity 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.180
 i feel so easy now 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.070
 happy for such an attitude to russia me 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.829
 seems just the very latest meanness 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.329
 what I like is that 80 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.880
 percent of the germans are against 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.890
 sanctions against Russia I am not against 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.180
 any conflicts with Russia they do not want 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.880
 of this war in Ukraine 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.199
 but so far these 80 percent of Germans are not 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.150
 take to the streets to demonstrate 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.680
 against this policy while we are all here 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.690
 let's just stare at etov 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.340
 no picture presentation 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.740
 question what it all means and not 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.720
 remembering who we are in the west for all 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.850
 this obliged reunion of germany 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.039
 if our citizens will celebrate and 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.639
 not to think about the reasons for the holiday 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.220
 they understand little of life on November 9th 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.590
 2013 marks 25 years from the day 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.070
 fall of the Berlin Wall without falling 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.110
 walls 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.669
 I would not live today in Berlin but somewhere 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.320
 in the countryside because i 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.660
 hate these control checkpoints 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.639
 personality but today's life berlin 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.590
 it would have been impossible without the help of the hunchback 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.930
 Russians as a whole so we should be 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.699
 he is grateful for it and we, on the contrary, 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.500
 what we do is punch in the face of Russian 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.120
 it's just a shame and I want to say that I 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.039
 I don't share politics in any way 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.080
 German government is just a shame and 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.699
 shame what play is here and 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.860
 authorities consciously and deliberately not 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.020
 remembers the Russians because their temple 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.849
 holding the muzzle of an american pistol i 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.280
 I repeat once again the reunification of Germany 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.169
 we owe to Russian and we owe trust 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.180
 us from the Russian credit of trust 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.789
 which Russians gave us and we now 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.530
 common feet is the trust of Russians to us I 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.970
 would be fucking mad at the germans and i would 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.130
 would hardly want to deal with 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:31.050
 Germany, I absolutely can understand if 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.120
 Russians today are mad at Germany for 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.889
 our behavior if they are today 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.810
 will say that the new you connected 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:41.669
 Germany has a short memory and extremely 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:43.800
 ungrateful country if Russian so 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.050
 today we think they are right 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.520
 although I do not know what they are really us 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.280
 think but I'm ashamed 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.190
 this situation which Russians have everything 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.130
 reason to think badly about germany yes and 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.880
 think so just about this channel 5 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.880
 thank
