00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.029 
8,000 192 is 8 gigabyte 4096 is 4
gigabyte<00:00:21.940> I<00:00:22.150> forgot<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.200> add<00:00:23.350> three<00:00:23.560> thousand

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
gigabyte I forgot to add three thousand

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.550 
gigabyte I forgot to add three thousand
gigabyte<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:24.730> think<00:00:25.539> it's<00:00:25.660> like<00:00:25.840> 2,000

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
gigabyte I think it's like 2,000

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.350 
gigabyte I think it's like 2,000
something<00:00:26.710> but<00:00:27.010> a<00:00:27.130> few<00:00:27.460> thousand<00:00:27.760> or<00:00:28.000> ever

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
something but a few thousand or ever

so you guys can see um I don't highly
recommend<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.359> three<00:00:37.749> gigabyte<00:00:38.199> but<00:00:38.979> if<00:00:39.159> you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
recommend you three gigabyte but if you

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.279 
recommend you three gigabyte but if you
want<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.789> you're<00:00:39.940> gonna<00:00:40.089> have<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.899> find<00:00:41.140> out

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
want to you're gonna have to find out

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.020 
want to you're gonna have to find out
what<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.589> half<00:00:41.979> of<00:00:42.069> that<00:00:42.190> is<00:00:42.399> which<00:00:42.640> shouldn't

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
what the half of that is which shouldn't

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.079 
what the half of that is which shouldn't
be<00:00:43.089> hard<00:00:43.149> can<00:00:43.749> we<00:00:43.809> have<00:00:43.929> calculators<00:00:45.719> 2048<00:00:46.719> x

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
be hard can we have calculators 2048 x

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.289 
be hard can we have calculators 2048 x
2048<00:00:49.089> is<00:00:49.389> two<00:00:49.600> gigabyte<00:00:50.760> 1024<00:00:51.760> is<00:00:51.940> one

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
2048 is two gigabyte 1024 is one

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.379 
2048 is two gigabyte 1024 is one
gigabyte<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.839> this<00:00:53.139> is<00:00:53.289> obviously<00:00:53.499> a<00:00:53.769> half<00:00:54.010> of

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:54.389 
gigabyte and this is obviously a half of

00:00:54.389 --> 00:01:00.809 
gigabyte and this is obviously a half of
1024<00:00:57.269> so<00:00:58.269> you<00:00:58.359> got<00:00:58.539> java<00:00:58.929> w<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.679> this<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.609> going

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
1024 so you got java w and this is going

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.609 
1024 so you got java w and this is going
to<00:01:00.909> be<00:01:00.999> half<00:01:01.299> of<00:01:01.769> what's<00:01:02.769> in<00:01:02.859> here<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:04.110> 1024<00:01:05.110> is

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
to be half of what's in here so 1024 is

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.859 
to be half of what's in here so 1024 is
one<00:01:06.460> gigabyte<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.060> i'm<00:01:07.119> going<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.329> join<00:01:07.689> these

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
one gigabyte so i'm going to join these

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.600 
one gigabyte so i'm going to join these
down<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.259> that<00:01:08.289> it<00:01:08.530> can't<00:01:08.979> read<00:01:09.189> out<00:01:09.310> these

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
down so that it can't read out these

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.850 
down so that it can't read out these
whole<00:01:09.759> entire<00:01:09.939> numbers<00:01:10.299> so<00:01:11.110> one<00:01:11.289> gigabyte<00:01:11.710> and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
whole entire numbers so one gigabyte and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.649 
whole entire numbers so one gigabyte and
then<00:01:12.729> you're<00:01:12.820> gonna<00:01:12.909> have<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.450> I'm

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
guys have not seen that yet so now if I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.890 
guys have not seen that yet so now if I
click<00:03:59.220> f3<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:01.290> can<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.650> right<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:02.340> it's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
click f3 you can see right here it's

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.050 
click f3 you can see right here it's
1000<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.049> is<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.440> think<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.980> used<00:04:05.130> about<00:04:05.459> 200

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
1000 which is I think you used about 200

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.090 
1000 which is I think you used about 200
and<00:04:06.269> be<00:04:06.480> all<00:04:06.959> right<00:04:07.140> I'm<00:04:07.620> not<00:04:07.799> sure<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:08.040> I

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
and be all right I'm not sure if I

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.650 
and be all right I'm not sure if I
should<00:04:08.130> call<00:04:08.400> megabytes<00:04:08.820> megabits<00:04:09.330> isn't

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
should call megabytes megabits isn't

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.810 
should call megabytes megabits isn't
right<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.769> does<00:04:10.980> matter<00:04:11.190> by<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.639> don't

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
right it does matter by really don't

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.470 
right it does matter by really don't
know<00:04:11.910> where<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.329> correctly

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
know where it is correctly

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.840 
know where it is correctly
so<00:04:14.690> now<00:04:14.870> use<00:04:15.560> memory<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:16.070> allocate<00:04:16.459> memory<00:04:16.609> is

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
so now use memory to allocate memory is

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.379 
so now use memory to allocate memory is
sixty-seven<00:04:17.449> percent<00:04:17.479> ah<00:04:18.459> but<00:04:19.459> yeah<00:04:19.669> we<00:04:20.150> used

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
sixty-seven percent ah but yeah we used

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.650 
sixty-seven percent ah but yeah we used
about<00:04:20.690> two<00:04:21.019> gigabyte<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:22.430> this<00:04:22.699> so<00:04:23.090> that's

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
about two gigabyte of this so that's

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.129 
about two gigabyte of this so that's
pretty<00:04:23.810> good<00:04:24.760> exit<00:04:25.760> out<00:04:25.880> yeah<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.870> can<00:04:27.020> see

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
pretty good exit out yeah you can see

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.260 
pretty good exit out yeah you can see
the<00:04:27.229> FPS<00:04:27.560> was<00:04:27.710> actually<00:04:28.010> up<00:04:28.190> by<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> lot<00:04:28.820> 52

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
the FPS was actually up by a lot 52

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.150 
the FPS was actually up by a lot 52
that's<00:04:29.720> better<00:04:30.220> than<00:04:31.220> before<00:04:31.460> ah<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:33.710> doesn't

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
that's better than before ah it doesn't

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.100 
that's better than before ah it doesn't

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
keep the two gigabyte of RAM to make it

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.790 
keep the two gigabyte of RAM to make it
look<00:04:38.360> better<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.810> stuff<00:04:39.020> I'm<00:04:39.560> going<00:04:39.710> to
