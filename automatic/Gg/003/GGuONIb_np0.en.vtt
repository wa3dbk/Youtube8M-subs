parallel<00:02:01.770> effect<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> guess<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.090> I'm

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
parallel effect here I guess as I'm

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090 
parallel effect here I guess as I'm
walking<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.899> between<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> saw<00:02:04.740> there

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
walking it's between to the saw there

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.600 
walking it's between to the saw there
maybe<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> bit<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.689> headache<00:02:07.610> skeletons

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
maybe have a bit of a headache skeletons

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.320 
maybe have a bit of a headache skeletons
are<00:02:08.910> scary<00:02:09.479> they're<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> smelly<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.760> don't

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
are scary they're kind of smelly I don't

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
are scary they're kind of smelly I don't
know<00:02:12.569> why<00:02:12.900> bones<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.470> smell<00:02:13.800> bad<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:16.230> it's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
know why bones would smell bad it's it's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.300 
know why bones would smell bad it's it's
mace<00:02:17.790> o'clock<00:02:18.739> although<00:02:19.739> I'm<00:02:19.890> running<00:02:20.160> out<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
mace o'clock although I'm running out of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.940 
mace o'clock although I'm running out of
time<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.849> midpoint<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.660> know<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:22.080> advance<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
time but a midpoint I know in advance is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.940 
time but a midpoint I know in advance is
kind<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> Brogan<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:25.110> know<00:02:25.260> because<00:02:25.590> it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
kind of Brogan so you know because it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.589 
kind of Brogan so you know because it
will<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.280> make<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.640> appear<00:02:26.940> at<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> nice<00:02:27.330> place

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
will not make you appear at a nice place

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.990 
will not make you appear at a nice place
so<00:02:27.750> what<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.769> want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.069> put<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> midpoint<00:02:29.700> there

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so what you want to put a midpoint there

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.190 
so what you want to put a midpoint there
so<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.420> put<00:02:30.540> them<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.989> bit<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so you can put them in a little bit and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.840 
so you can put them in a little bit and
until<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> might<00:02:31.709> run<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.160> time<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.670> don't

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
until I might run out of time I don't

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
zoo because the time limit thing but

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.320 
zoo because the time limit thing but
with<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.540> checkpoint<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.349> doesn't<00:03:34.830> work

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
with the checkpoint that doesn't work

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.119 
with the checkpoint that doesn't work
let's<00:03:36.330> do<00:03:36.510> sure<00:03:36.750> how<00:03:36.930> would<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.290> handle<00:03:37.830> this

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
let's do sure how would I handle this

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.970 
let's do sure how would I handle this
also<00:03:38.730> because<00:03:39.629> it's<00:03:39.959> like<00:03:40.140> these<00:03:40.620> are

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
also because it's like these are

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.789 
also because it's like these are
obstacles<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.750> kind<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.260> have<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.680> wait

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
obstacles you just kind of have to wait

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.199 
obstacles you just kind of have to wait
around<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:45.349> waiting<00:03:46.349> around<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
around for but waiting around is a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.910 
around for but waiting around is a
luxury<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.330> have<00:03:48.690> right<00:03:48.989> now<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.680> isn't

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
luxury I have right now and this isn't

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.270 
luxury I have right now and this isn't
going<00:03:50.310> well<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.790> slightest<00:03:51.590> come<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.739> just

that's a reset pipe oh boy when was that
pipe<00:04:38.580> ever<00:04:38.970> hear<00:04:39.479> like<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:40.289> oh<00:04:40.500> it's<00:04:40.530> on<00:04:40.950> the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
other side of that thing but it's just a

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.409 
other side of that thing but it's just a
reset<00:04:43.620> pipe<00:04:43.800> again<00:04:44.039> well<00:04:44.760> let's<00:04:45.000> see<00:04:45.240> what

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
reset pipe again well let's see what

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.870 
reset pipe again well let's see what
this<00:04:45.720> makes<00:04:46.050> us<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:46.710> here<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.010> got<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.400> ledge<00:04:47.849> and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
this makes us so here I got a ledge and

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.909 
this makes us so here I got a ledge and
I<00:04:48.180> can<00:04:48.360> go<00:04:48.479> under<00:04:48.780> here<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.320> they<00:04:49.410> need<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
I can go under here and they need the

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.670 
I can go under here and they need the
silver<00:04:50.190> P<00:04:50.520> that's<00:04:50.700> way<00:04:50.849> over<00:04:51.240> there<00:04:51.419> so

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
silver P that's way over there so

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.640 
silver P that's way over there so
basically<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:53.250> like<00:04:54.120> God<00:04:54.450> both<00:04:54.810> p-switches<00:04:55.380> and

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
basically I like God both p-switches and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.560 
basically I like God both p-switches and
I'm<00:04:55.740> using<00:04:55.979> this<00:04:56.340> trick<00:04:56.700> to<00:04:56.910> keep<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.300> silver

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
I'm using this trick to keep the silver

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.129 
I'm using this trick to keep the silver
B<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.289> reset<00:04:59.220> my<00:04:59.250> time<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.789> everything<00:05:00.210> okay

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
B and reset my time and everything okay

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.430 
B and reset my time and everything okay
so<00:05:01.200> pressing<00:05:02.190> both<00:05:02.700> switches<00:05:03.510> at<00:05:03.720> once<00:05:03.960> here

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
so pressing both switches at once here

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.680 
so pressing both switches at once here
opens<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.190> path<00:05:05.400> there<00:05:05.729> even<00:05:06.090> gets<00:05:06.360> me<00:05:06.660> a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
opens the path there even gets me a

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.400 
opens the path there even gets me a
mushroom<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.639> count<00:05:09.030> them<00:05:09.410> technically

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
mushroom and I count them technically

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.219 
mushroom and I count them technically
and<00:05:10.889> in<00:05:11.099> ferry<00:05:11.520> go<00:05:11.880> with<00:05:12.090> this<00:05:12.300> pipe<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.900> see

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
and in ferry go with this pipe and see

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.620 
and in ferry go with this pipe and see
what<00:05:13.440> is<00:05:13.680> up<00:05:13.950> I'm<00:05:14.160> giving<00:05:14.550> myself<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:15.180> mid<00:05:15.389> point

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
what is up I'm giving myself a mid point

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.610 
what is up I'm giving myself a mid point
oh<00:05:16.440> it's<00:05:16.770> slow<00:05:17.250> that<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.450> a<00:05:18.479> lot<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.990> fireballs

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
oh it's slow that is a lot of fireballs

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.909 
oh it's slow that is a lot of fireballs
it's<00:05:20.010> fire<00:05:20.430> swarm<00:05:20.910> Wendy<00:05:21.479> jeez<00:05:21.750> okay<00:05:22.620> well

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
it's fire swarm Wendy jeez okay well

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.370 
it's fire swarm Wendy jeez okay well
actually<00:05:23.240> because<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:24.780> way<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.169> they

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
actually because of the way that they

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.159 
actually because of the way that they
were<00:05:25.789> you<00:05:26.789> can<00:05:27.000> see<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.389> they're<00:05:27.570> basically

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
were you can see that they're basically

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.580 
were you can see that they're basically
work<00:05:28.380> like<00:05:28.620> two

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
work like two

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.660 
work like two
units<00:05:30.430> rather<00:05:30.730> than<00:05:31.060> six<00:05:31.390> individual<00:05:32.170> ones<00:05:32.670> so

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
units rather than six individual ones so

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.610 
units rather than six individual ones so
really<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.180> just<00:05:34.240> need<00:05:34.540> to<00:05:34.750> consider<00:05:35.230> them<00:05:35.590> as

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
really you just need to consider them as

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.260 
really you just need to consider them as
like<00:05:35.980> larger<00:05:36.610> than<00:05:36.850> normal<00:05:37.060> enemies<00:05:37.840> and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
like larger than normal enemies and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.000 
like larger than normal enemies and
basically<00:05:40.270> bench<00:05:40.720> on<00:05:40.990> being<00:05:41.230> lucky<00:05:41.650> with<00:05:41.860> the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
basically bench on being lucky with the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.520 
basically bench on being lucky with the
position<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.580> windy<00:05:42.850> there<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.930> everything

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
position of windy there and everything

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.370 
position of windy there and everything
will<00:05:44.680> be<00:05:44.710> fine<00:05:45.130> that<00:05:45.660> gameplay<00:05:46.660> tip<00:05:46.990> for<00:05:47.290> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
will be fine that gameplay tip for the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.790 
will be fine that gameplay tip for the
masses<00:05:47.980> be<00:05:48.550> lucky<00:05:49.150> where<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.080> placement<00:05:50.710> of

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
masses be lucky where the placement of

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.130 
masses be lucky where the placement of
the<00:05:50.980> enemies<00:05:51.460> so<00:05:51.970> now<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.150> can<00:05:52.450> put<00:05:52.660> that<00:05:52.810> in<00:05:53.020> the

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
the enemies so now I can put that in the

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.350 
the enemies so now I can put that in the
strategy<00:05:53.650> guide<00:05:53.860> Pat<00:05:54.280> it<00:05:54.520> out<00:05:54.640> with<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.120> same
