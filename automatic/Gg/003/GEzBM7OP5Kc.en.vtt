the<00:00:22.430> kind<00:00:22.610> I'm<00:00:22.760> using<00:00:22.970> is<00:00:23.210> actually<00:00:23.330> meant<00:00:23.810> to

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
the kind I'm using is actually meant to

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.460 
the kind I'm using is actually meant to
put<00:00:24.710> photos<00:00:25.400> on<00:00:25.580> mounting<00:00:26.480> board<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.170> it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
put photos on mounting board and so it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.170 
put photos on mounting board and so it
sticks<00:00:27.710> pretty<00:00:27.890> well<00:00:28.100> and<00:00:28.370> then<00:00:28.880> you'll<00:00:29.000> need

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
sticks pretty well and then you'll need

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.450 
sticks pretty well and then you'll need
a<00:00:29.390> piece<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.900> acetate<00:00:30.230> or<00:00:30.710> other<00:00:31.130> clear

cut to somewhat equal pieces of plastic

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.510 
cut to somewhat equal pieces of plastic
those<00:00:51.200> are<00:00:51.350> going<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.500> be<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.680> base<00:00:51.860> of<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
those are going to be the base of the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.549 
those are going to be the base of the
bookmark<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.190> cut<00:00:58.399> down<00:00:59.170> fairly<00:01:00.170> easily

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
bookmark and you cut down fairly easily

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.840 
bookmark and you cut down fairly easily
for<00:01:00.890> trimming<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.190> edges<00:01:01.280> later<00:01:01.610> so<00:01:01.760> they

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
for trimming the edges later so they

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.410 
for trimming the edges later so they
don't<00:01:02.000> be<00:01:02.120> perfect<00:01:03.939> now<00:01:04.939> what<00:01:05.089> you're<00:01:05.239> going

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.370 
excess through the excesses we'll just
take<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:56.000> trim<00:02:56.360> off<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> edge<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:57.140> a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
take it and trim off the edge just a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:08.530 
take it and trim off the edge just a
little<00:02:57.410> bit<00:03:06.519> then<00:03:07.519> we'll<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:07.820> trim<00:03:08.150> the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
little bit then we'll just trim the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.320 
little bit then we'll just trim the
edges<00:03:08.690> off<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.170> top<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:11.320> off<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.530> bottom<00:03:12.830> and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
edges off the top and off the bottom and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.430 
edges off the top and off the bottom and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
