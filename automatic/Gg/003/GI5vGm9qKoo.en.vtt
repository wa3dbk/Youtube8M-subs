restocking on my military support
Gunners<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:29.319> they<00:02:29.440> will<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.739> flesh<00:02:30.069> hands

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
Gunners but they will have flesh hands

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.460 
Gunners but they will have flesh hands
because<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.569> guys<00:02:31.690> didn't<00:02:32.050> really<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
because you guys didn't really like the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.140 
because you guys didn't really like the
yellow<00:02:32.620> hands<00:02:32.890> which<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.250> fine<00:02:33.489> i<00:02:33.730> just

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
yellow hands which is fine i just

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.030 
yellow hands which is fine i just
thought<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.630> look<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.410> more<00:02:35.560> accurate

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
thought it look a little more accurate

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.640 
thought it look a little more accurate
for<00:02:36.220> those<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.550> play<00:02:36.790> battlefield<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:38.470> they

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
for those to play battlefield but they

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.910 
for those to play battlefield but they
will<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:39.010> coming<00:02:39.160> with<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.610> c4s<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:40.800> which<00:02:41.800> i

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.900 
building the minecraft village i have
all<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> parts<00:03:09.880> right<00:03:10.090> there<00:03:10.150> um<00:03:10.709> but<00:03:11.709> yeah<00:03:11.910> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
all the parts right there um but yeah a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.800 
all the parts right there um but yeah a
little<00:03:13.630> bit<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.840> progress<00:03:14.019> on<00:03:14.470> these<00:03:14.650> i<00:03:15.640> made<00:03:16.570> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
little bit of progress on these i made a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.560 
little bit of progress on these i made a
mold<00:03:17.109> for<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:21.609> one<00:03:22.150> with<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.329> bigger

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
mold for this the one with the bigger

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.940 
mold for this the one with the bigger
hole<00:03:24.329> but<00:03:25.329> i<00:03:25.359> still<00:03:25.600> need<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.870> work<00:03:25.989> on<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.230> i

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
hole but i still need to work on that i

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.449 
hole but i still need to work on that i
keep<00:03:27.579> getting<00:03:27.730> short<00:03:28.180> shots<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.340> let<00:03:30.340> me<00:03:30.430> know

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
keep getting short shots and let me know

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.550 
keep getting short shots and let me know
if<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.760> want<00:03:30.910> me<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.209> videos<00:03:31.570> on<00:03:31.870> making

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
if you want me to do videos on making

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.140 
if you want me to do videos on making
molds<00:03:32.829> and<00:03:33.010> stuff<00:03:33.310> i<00:03:33.489> really<00:03:33.880> think<00:03:34.030> that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
molds and stuff i really think that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.400 
molds and stuff i really think that
would<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.420> kind<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.690> an<00:03:34.810> interesting<00:03:35.019> video

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
would be kind of an interesting video

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.120 
would be kind of an interesting video
for<00:03:35.799> example<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.840> kind<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.290> rough<00:03:38.500> mold

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
for example this is kind of a rough mold

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.020 
for example this is kind of a rough mold
I<00:03:39.310> made<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.829> yeah<00:03:41.980> that's<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.579> new<00:03:42.730> part

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
I made so yeah that's for the new part

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.330 
I made so yeah that's for the new part
and<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.720> hole<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:43.959> bigger<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.709> it's<00:03:45.190> not

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
and the hole is bigger and it's not

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.259 
and the hole is bigger and it's not
attached<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:47.549> which<00:03:48.549> would<00:03:48.790> call<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
attached to the which would call it the

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.910 
attached to the which would call it the
slot<00:03:50.049> up<00:03:50.260> here<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.220> as<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:52.000> can<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.769> there<00:03:53.769> is

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
slot up here so as you can see there is

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.090 
slot up here so as you can see there is
some<00:03:54.190> difference<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.680> would<00:03:56.799> be<00:03:56.920> like<00:03:57.040> a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
some difference and it would be like a

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.670 
some difference and it would be like a
slip<00:03:57.549> on<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.850> wouldn't<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> clip<00:03:58.569> on<00:03:58.780> which<00:03:59.500> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
slip on it wouldn't be a clip on which I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.090 
slip on it wouldn't be a clip on which I
think<00:03:59.709> would<00:04:00.130> be<00:04:00.250> more<00:04:00.430> durable<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:02.319> it<00:04:02.950> would

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
think would be more durable and it would

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.120 
think would be more durable and it would
probably<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.910> might<00:04:04.389> break<00:04:04.859> clipping<00:04:05.859> on<00:04:05.980> to

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
probably it might break clipping on to

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.129 
probably it might break clipping on to
such<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> big<00:04:06.549> part<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.980> yeah<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:10.690> is<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.079> a

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
such a big part so yeah this is just a

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.289 
such a big part so yeah this is just a
piece<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.319> aluminum<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.519> cut<00:04:12.790> down<00:04:12.819> so

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
piece of aluminum that I cut down so

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.770 
piece of aluminum that I cut down so
it's<00:04:13.480> perfectly<00:04:13.959> square<00:04:14.470> on<00:04:14.739> each<00:04:15.129> side<00:04:15.780> fully

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
it's perfectly square on each side fully

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.690 
it's perfectly square on each side fully
machined<00:04:17.099> so<00:04:18.099> I<00:04:18.130> thought<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.340> was<00:04:18.519> kind<00:04:18.669> of

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
machined so I thought that was kind of

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.379 
machined so I thought that was kind of
cool

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
cool

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.659 
cool
and<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:20.229> think<00:04:20.829> I'm<00:04:21.039> going<00:04:21.159> to<00:04:21.219> be<00:04:21.280> doing<00:04:21.459> that

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
and I think I'm going to be doing that

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.570 
and I think I'm going to be doing that
