maintaining steady hover from there we

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.140 
maintaining steady hover from there we

whether your rights your are you going

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.500 
whether your rights your are you going
where<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.550> think<00:04:37.849> you<00:04:37.970> are<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.360> then<00:04:38.479> the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
where you think you are and then the

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.899 
where you think you are and then the

position you think you are if you're

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
hovering next to the ship the ship rolls

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.250 
hovering next to the ship the ship rolls
towards<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.460> at<00:04:43.699> night<00:04:43.970> you're<00:04:44.960> not

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
towards you at night you're not

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.659 
towards you at night you're not
necessarily<00:04:45.530> sure<00:04:46.070> whether

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
necessarily sure whether

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.369 
necessarily sure whether
thus<00:04:46.879> if<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.060> like<00:04:47.330> toward<00:04:47.569> you<00:04:47.780> or<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.319> are

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
thus if you like toward you or you are

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.830 
thus if you like toward you or you are
drifting<00:04:48.800> towards<00:04:49.129> the<00:04:49.159> ship<00:04:49.520> if<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.270> if<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
drifting towards the ship if you if the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.330 
drifting towards the ship if you if the
ships<00:04:51.139> rolling<00:04:51.439> towards<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.009> you<00:04:52.129> think

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
ships rolling towards you and you think

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.739 
ships rolling towards you and you think
you're<00:04:52.520> actually<00:04:52.699> drifting<00:04:53.180> on<00:04:53.210> your<00:04:53.509> ship

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:53.749 
you're actually drifting on your ship

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.869 
you're actually drifting on your ship
you're<00:04:54.439> gonna<00:04:54.560> come<00:04:54.800> left<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.340> come<00:04:55.580> away<00:04:55.699> from

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 
you're gonna come left to come away from

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.610 
you're gonna come left to come away from
the<00:04:56.120> ship<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.389> at<00:04:56.689> that<00:04:56.870> moment<00:04:57.110> your<00:04:57.439> ships

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
the ship and at that moment your ships

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.959 
the ship and at that moment your ships
going<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.860> start<00:04:58.069> rolling<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.400> other<00:04:58.580> way<00:04:58.729> and

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969 
going to start rolling the other way and

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.879 
going to start rolling the other way and
your<00:04:59.110> separation<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.289> grade<00:05:00.529> is<00:05:00.680> going<00:05:00.800> to

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
your separation and grade is going to

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.219 
your separation and grade is going to
increase<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.610> then<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.180> overcorrect<00:05:02.870> coming

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
increase so then you overcorrect coming

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.809 
increase so then you overcorrect coming
back<00:05:03.439> and<00:05:03.710> right<00:05:04.189> about<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.490> time<00:05:04.669> you're

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
back and right about the time you're

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.339 
back and right about the time you're
moving<00:05:04.939> into<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.389> ship<00:05:05.569> again<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:05.990> ship<00:05:06.169> will

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
moving into the ship again the ship will

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.140 
moving into the ship again the ship will
roll<00:05:06.560> toward<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.069> and<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.759> you<00:05:07.819> get<00:05:07.939> some

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
roll toward you and so you get some

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.969 
roll toward you and so you get some
pilot<00:05:08.479> induced<00:05:08.779> oscillations<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:09.650> we<00:05:09.800> have<00:05:09.889> to

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
pilot induced oscillations so we have to

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.260 
pilot induced oscillations so we have to
be<00:05:10.039> very<00:05:10.219> mindful<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.819> what's<00:05:11.090> actually

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
be very mindful of what's actually

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.300 
be very mindful of what's actually
happening<00:05:11.539> out<00:05:12.050> there<00:05:12.080> by<00:05:12.860> just<00:05:13.099> quickly

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
happening out there by just quickly

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.860 
happening out there by just quickly
glancing<00:05:13.819> back<00:05:13.999> and<00:05:14.240> forth<00:05:14.449> from<00:05:14.749> the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
glancing back and forth from the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.080
