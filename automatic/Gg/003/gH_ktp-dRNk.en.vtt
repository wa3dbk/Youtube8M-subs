 I immediately guessed something might be me 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.100
 really liked the design here 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.600
 such a box is usually such boxes 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.520
 velvet is generally one-color then so 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.700
 very cute and in this box lay here 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.799
 My husband gave me a gold bracelet 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.240
 so thin but he is very very 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.850
 beautiful he really liked that 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.439
 tiptoe looks like a chain 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.540
 which this year received a day 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.159
 birth than here are two gifts 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.430
 Were in this box from husband 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.009
 camping in cafes in general and all such 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.930
 petty cute next gift 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.979
 who got it on her birthday 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.909
 There was a gift from my girlfriend from a neighbor 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.840
 from kuma 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.399
 these were three products from Loreal's firm 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.750
 In principle, I can say that these were 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.930
 gifts so let's say so ordered ordered 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.299
 that is, said to want to get 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.649
 and now I got these three presents 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.189
 the first is tonally 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.340
 again from l'oreal lumi magic magic 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 light in the second shades n2 gentle vanilla 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.459
 I wrote to the channel again that is suitable for 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:23.739
 all skin types it fills with light 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.870
 general and fig skin radiance from the inside is perfect 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:32.349
 even tone technology spooky light here in 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 general that at least said first 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.739
 what I think this tonal 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.400
 The basis is suitable only for girls with 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.819
 dry skin 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.590
 that is, there is no normal fat in two 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.849
 hours and and definitely not on my skin with 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.189
 that I am fixing this foundation on her with powder 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.900
 there is it gives a very beautiful glow 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.109
 everything is good but it is absolutely not so much 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.180
 that is, she smears all my clothes and 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.099
 barely touched all of her no she 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.379
 little tezhelovato to apply ie 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.459
 I put the night to distribute her here 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.160
 already there is not much of it, well, like 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.260
 But on not approached this is not for me personally 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.849
 my skin type turned tonal 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.530
 the basics 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.909
 second product is also loyal magic 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.909
 studio to 4 lumiere 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:32.859
 this concealer is easier in general 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.840
 face concealer written 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.650
 for masking dark circles under 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.430
 eyes 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.919
 he with reflective particles he 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.409
 very similar to the one that I had from 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:50.620
 artdeco that is such a spout from him 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.819
 here he gets out and out 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.090
 I have in the second shade of media to me he 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.970
 really liked him not so much as them 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.680
 would hide dark circles no but these 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.940
 here are the pieces that have it in it 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.849
 reflecting as if they dissipate something 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.060
 that is, from afar ie 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.530
 bruises not 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.420
 if you come closer and consider them 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.359
 will be seen but I really liked 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.930
 means but very light very refreshing 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.050
 a look, that is, I am quite a third 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.919
 the product is lately my 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.930
 the most favorite mascara from wari armies and he 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.010
 extra black cilia 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.740
 Here's a silicone brush with 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:41.630
 Last time I bought this mascara. 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.660
 I bought it in March of the past 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.940
 years and I used it more than 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.500
 half a year for me it is very surprising 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.580
 I really, really liked 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.320
 but for some reason it is this here 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.169
 as if not working that is 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.360
 especially the first three applications in general 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.540
 point was disappointed and did not even realize I 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.120
 I did not recognize her , but now, in principle, I 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.010
 and take advantage 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.280
 she is already beginning to resemble that 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.860
 if I remember for myself in general, not 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.840
 I know while the double feeling that is, I her 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.710
 loved loved very much and that's it 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.450
 for some reason 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.960
 a little bit wrong with deadlines 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.780
 shelf life all right product and here 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.250
 the next gifts since that year 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.520
 me with gifts somehow did not work out 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.710
 my gifts didn't come them don't know I steal 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.620
 lost in the mail in general did not work out and 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.690
 and so this year I give presents to myself from 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.840
 my relatives and friends did in advance 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.960
 so my mother 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.830
 I gave money for them in Yalta 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.410
 I bought some gizmos here 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.620
 also when i was visiting mom i 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.150
 I bought myself two presents right now I 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.280
 I will show you as a gift that is to me 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.800
 gave mom it was like that 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.970
 shoes 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.100
 I want to say what I have after 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.220
 pregnancy is some kind of leg problem 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.620
 happened i can't wear shoes which 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.110
 I bought before pregnancy even when 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.380
 I buy myself now a lot of shoes 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.330
 that is, I can take my degree 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.390
 walk like when at least all conveniently 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.230
 everything is good means finding there not do 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:23.430
 with rubs in general, I hope that with 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.730
 these shoes this will not happen i 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.770
 took them talkin 'in the shop that i 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.050
 two days I look out of the house if I feel 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.330
 that there is no then I will come them or changed there 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.320
 what are you so green they are so black 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.980
 green 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.560
 under the python made shoes here here 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:50.650
 they are such cuts like on 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.080
 short heels here for lumps 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.750
 Here is such a gold detail of points in 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.730
 overall looks very neat on 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.670
 go out with your child every day 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.160
 walking gave me such shoes 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.080
 but I thought, I thought not in general 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.600
 liked one more when mine 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.510
 relatives gave me denyuzhki went 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.660
 and as if from them I bought myself 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:17.200
 such shoes can be said not even 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.200
 know moccasins checks call them in general they 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.350
 black suede they have such 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.260
 here are small letters d with pebbles also very 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:29.050
 low heels but these shoes are like 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.230
 slippers, that is, these are definitely nothing 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.970
 I am sure about this work 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:37.750
 took them because they are very me 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:41.290
 like the comfort that they feel 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.660
 when I shod them twice already in a hub 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.290
 there was such a weather when they were essentially 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:52.110
 plus 20 e x 2 already on the street so I already 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.110
 I know that I did not like it as a gift
