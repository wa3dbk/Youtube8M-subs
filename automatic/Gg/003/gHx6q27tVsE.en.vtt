balance<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.140> associated<00:01:40.650> around<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> inner

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
balance is associated around the inner

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.760 
balance is associated around the inner
ear<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.140> area<00:01:43.350> where<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
ear right in this area where the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.819 
ear right in this area where the
temporal<00:01:44.100> mandibular<00:01:44.790> joint<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.680> having<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
temporal mandibular joint is having that

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.580 
temporal mandibular joint is having that
in<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> correct<00:01:47.369> position<00:01:47.930> just<00:01:48.930> overall

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
in the correct position just overall

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.389 
in the correct position just overall
affects<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.350> have<00:01:52.350> balance<00:01:52.860> how<00:01:53.130> your

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
affects how you have balance how your

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.910 
affects how you have balance how your
your<00:01:54.119> core<00:01:54.570> muscles<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.590> everything

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
your core muscles and everything

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.830 
your core muscles and everything
performed<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.549> getting<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> right

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
performed so getting that in the right

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.730 
performed so getting that in the right
position<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:59.390> very<00:02:00.390> important<00:02:00.990> point<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
position is very important point to that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950 
position is very important point to that
area<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.310> closer<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> new<00:02:03.780> job

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
area can be closer this is the new job

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.590 
area can be closer this is the new job
how<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.320> lines<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.189> right<00:02:05.490> how<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.329> jaw

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
how that lines up right how the jaw

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
how that lines up right how the jaw
lines<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.799> skull<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
lines up with your with your skull and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.369 
lines up with your with your skull and
these<00:02:08.819> mouth<00:02:09.179> guards<00:02:09.539> obviously<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.259> on

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
these mouth guards obviously they go on

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.770 
these mouth guards obviously they go on
your<00:02:10.530> teeth<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.160> put<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.150> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
your teeth and put that in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.110 
your teeth and put that in
correct<00:02:13.110> position<00:02:13.680> okay<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.520> enhances

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
correct position okay and that enhances

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.460 
correct position okay and that enhances
they<00:02:15.300> work<00:02:15.569> out<00:02:15.750> by<00:02:15.930> getting<00:02:15.990> what<00:02:16.290> more

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
they work out by getting what more

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.790 
they work out by getting what more
oxygen<00:02:17.450> actually<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.720> doing<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.530> isn't

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
oxygen actually what it's doing it isn't

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.640 
oxygen actually what it's doing it isn't
more<00:02:19.890> oxygen<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:21.510> little<00:02:21.810> yellow<00:02:21.990> pad<00:02:22.410> is

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
more oxygen that little yellow pad is

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.250 
more oxygen that little yellow pad is
under<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.670> puts<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.150> jaw<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.750> what<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.140> like

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
under that puts the jaw and what we like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.210 
under that puts the jaw and what we like
to<00:02:25.290> call<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.560> sweet<00:02:26.040> spot<00:02:26.240> so<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:27.390> an<00:02:27.510> optimal

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
to call a sweet spot so it's an optimal

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.370 
to call a sweet spot so it's an optimal
position<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.459> protects<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.690> enhances

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
position that protects and enhances

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.400 
position that protects and enhances
performance<00:02:32.000> when<00:02:33.000> when<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.630> are<00:02:34.050> under

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
performance when when we are under

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.650 
performance when when we are under
stress<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:35.580> clinch<00:02:35.880> at<00:02:36.090> eight<00:02:36.270> that's<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
stress we clinch at eight that's the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.830 
stress we clinch at eight that's the
first<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.739> clenching<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.340> our<00:02:38.459> teeth

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
first thing that clenching of our teeth

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.770 
first thing that clenching of our teeth
closes<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> circuit<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.709> whole<00:02:41.160> cascade<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
closes the circuit on a whole cascade of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
closes the circuit on a whole cascade of
hormonal<00:02:43.350> things<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.040> released<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
hormonal things that are released and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.240 
hormonal things that are released and
and<00:02:45.080> cortisol<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.410> some<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.830> things<00:02:47.070> that

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and cortisol and some of the things that

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.040 
and cortisol and some of the things that
are<00:02:47.340> released<00:02:47.519> when<00:02:47.670> you're<00:02:47.880> under<00:02:48.090> stress<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
are released when you're under stress so

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.500 
are released when you're under stress so
that<00:02:49.290> little<00:02:49.530> sweet<00:02:49.980> spot<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.880> made

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
that little sweet spot because I made

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
that little sweet spot because I made
mouthguards<00:02:52.019> years<00:02:52.230> ago<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.680> Edgar<00:02:53.040> bad<00:02:53.220> news

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
this then we could have enhanced their

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.100 
this then we could have enhanced their
performance<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.550> now<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:05.850> know<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.989> know

believe<00:04:10.500> where's<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.310> appliance<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.090> he

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
believe where's this appliance and he

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.390 
believe where's this appliance and he
went<00:04:13.019> from<00:04:13.200> being<00:04:13.290> one<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.769> top<00:04:13.799> ten<00:04:14.220> wide

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.130 
went from being one of the top ten wide
receivers<00:04:14.880> into<00:04:15.150> probably<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.690> top<00:04:15.870> wide

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
receivers into probably the top wide

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.069
