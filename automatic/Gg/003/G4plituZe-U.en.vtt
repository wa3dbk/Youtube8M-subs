have enough space and put a repeater

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.859 
have enough space and put a repeater
going<00:00:29.310> into<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> command<00:00:29.970> block<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.689> come

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
going into a command block and this come

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
going into a command block and this come
on<00:00:30.960> rock<00:00:31.199> he's<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.710> say<00:00:31.949> test<00:00:32.309> before

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
on rock he's gonna say test before

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.740 
on rock he's gonna say test before
nearest<00:00:33.210> player<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.550> want<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.880> put<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
nearest player and you want to put the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
nearest player and you want to put the
coordinates<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.559> where<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> button<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.110> like

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
coordinates of where the button is like

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.740 
coordinates of where the button is like
maybe<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.680> block<00:00:40.800> away<00:00:40.860> from<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
maybe just one block away from it so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.250 
maybe just one block away from it so
this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:43.260> minus<00:00:43.710> four<00:00:44.840> 66-59<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
this is at minus four 66-59 so like that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
this is at minus four 66-59 so like that
so<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> coordinates<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
so you do you got the coordinates and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
so you do you got the coordinates and
then<00:00:54.120> he<00:00:54.180> typed<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.170> daddy's<00:00:55.440> put<00:00:55.620> x

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
then he typed in here you daddy's put x

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
then he typed in here you daddy's put x
equals<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.460> y<00:00:56.579> equals<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.170> first

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
equals or y equals because the first

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
equals or y equals because the first
three<00:00:59.359> spaces<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.910> parameters<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
three spaces in the in the parameters of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.590 
three spaces in the in the parameters of
test<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.930> commands<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.470> any<00:01:04.949> command<00:01:05.600> will

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
test for commands or any command will

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
test for commands or any command will
always<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.990> X<00:01:07.350> Y<00:01:08.040> Zed<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.680> after<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.100> will

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
always be X Y Zed so after that you will

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
always be X Y Zed so after that you will
need<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> put<00:01:11.610> radius<00:01:12.110> within<00:01:13.110> R<00:01:13.380> equals<00:01:13.799> and

need to put radius within R equals and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.050 
need to put radius within R equals and
don't<00:01:15.360> forget<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:15.869> score<00:01:16.850> points<00:01:17.850> and

don't forget to put score points and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.200 
don't forget to put score points and
then<00:01:18.390> min<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> cost<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.920> Park

nine which is one less of the cost of
the<00:02:57.219> door<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.299> door<00:02:58.689> costs<00:02:58.959> fifty<00:02:59.319> then

the door so the door costs fifty then

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.899 
the door so the door costs fifty then
you<00:03:00.489> put<00:03:00.639> forty<00:03:00.939> nine<00:03:01.439> etc<00:03:02.439> oh<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.680> forgot<00:03:03.069> then

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
you put forty nine etc oh I forgot then

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.920 
you put forty nine etc oh I forgot then

which is like I don't have enough points

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.479 
which is like I don't have enough points
something<00:03:10.750> like<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.219> you<00:03:12.219> can<00:03:12.340> customize

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
something like that you can customize

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.569 
something like that you can customize
that<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.299> everyone<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:17.530> will<00:03:17.650> say<00:03:17.889> the

player who doesn't enough points and

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.479 
player who doesn't enough points and
then<00:03:20.859> it'll<00:03:21.040> display<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.400> quote<00:03:22.409> next<00:03:23.489> you

then it'll display the quote next you

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.860 
then it'll display the quote next you
want<00:03:24.669> under<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.299> side<00:03:25.659> you<00:03:26.079> want<00:03:26.349> scoreboard

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
want under this side you want scoreboard

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.330 
want under this side you want scoreboard

lying capitals obviously school board
players<00:03:33.449> remove<00:03:34.449> at<00:03:35.019> nearest<00:03:35.470> player<00:03:35.680> than

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
players remove at nearest player than

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.699 
players remove at nearest player than
the<00:03:36.129> coordinates<00:03:36.750> which<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.989> hopefully<00:03:38.500> this

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
the coordinates which is hopefully this

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.289 
the coordinates which is hopefully this
then<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.579> radius<00:03:40.049> then<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.530> score<00:03:42.299> points

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
then the radius then the score points

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.069 
then the radius then the score points
min<00:03:44.109> equals<00:03:44.709> in<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.979> cost<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.549> door<00:03:46.079> then

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
min equals in the cost of the door then

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.800 
min equals in the cost of the door then
put<00:03:47.829> your<00:03:48.159> variable<00:03:48.519> again<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.060> then<00:03:49.329> put<00:03:49.509> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
put your variable again and then put the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.789 
put your variable again and then put the
cost<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.199> door<00:03:50.319> again

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
cost of the door again

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.009 
cost of the door again
so<00:03:51.549> that'll<00:03:51.759> test<00:03:51.970> for<00:03:52.180> people<00:03:52.479> who<00:03:52.659> have<00:03:52.840> ten

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
so that'll test for people who have ten

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.390 
so that'll test for people who have ten
points<00:03:53.229> more<00:03:53.439> and<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:53.949> it<00:03:54.069> removes<00:03:54.310> the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
points more and then it removes the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.339 
points more and then it removes the
templates<00:03:54.759> from<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:54.909> player<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.139> wouldn't

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
templates from the player so it wouldn't

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.709 
templates from the player so it wouldn't
work<00:03:56.500> if<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.040> have<00:03:57.129> nine<00:03:57.310> points<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.969> showing

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
work if you have nine points and showing

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.089 
work if you have nine points and showing
a<00:03:58.780> by<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.930> door<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.139> should<00:03:59.409> have<00:03:59.500> minus<00:03:59.949> 1

a by the door I should have minus 1

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.699 
a by the door I should have minus 1
points<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.579> I<00:04:00.609> just<00:04:00.790> won't<00:04:00.939> work<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.709> that's

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
points and I just won't work and that's

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.099 
points and I just won't work and that's
for<00:04:03.310> multiplayer<00:04:03.699> enabled<00:04:04.979> next<00:04:05.979> you<00:04:06.400> want

doors<00:04:48.060> open<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:49.470> will<00:04:49.890> so<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.340> debris

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
doors open and the will so the debris

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.870 
doors open and the will so the debris
opens<00:04:52.470> as<00:04:52.590> well<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.160> that's<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:56.730> can

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
opens as well so that's it you can

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.090 
opens as well so that's it you can
customize<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.630> doors<00:04:57.840> in<00:04:57.990> debris<00:04:58.350> before<00:04:58.680> to

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
customize the doors in debris before to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.530 
customize the doors in debris before to
whatever<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.430> want<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.640> your<00:04:59.670> map<00:04:59.940> if<00:05:00.270> you're

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
whatever you want in your map if you're

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.750 
whatever you want in your map if you're
creating<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> map<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.370> but<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.580> hope

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
creating a map that is but so I hope

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.160 
creating a map that is but so I hope
this<00:05:02.850> helped<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.420> want<00:05:03.570> more<00:05:04.050> tutorials

at<00:05:09.420> random<00:05:09.690> walks<00:05:09.900> I've<00:05:10.320> just<00:05:10.620> I've<00:05:10.920> already

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
at random walks I've just I've already

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.910 
at random walks I've just I've already
given<00:05:11.340> her<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.670> schematic<00:05:12.410> file<00:05:13.410> for<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.620> and

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
given her a schematic file for that and

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.130 
given her a schematic file for that and
the<00:05:14.010> PERT<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:16.340> punch<00:05:17.340> is<00:05:18.140> very

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
the PERT and the punch is very

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.050 
the PERT and the punch is very
complicated<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.740> do<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.340> do<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.520> tutorial<00:05:20.730> on

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
complicated to do to do a tutorial on

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.920 
complicated to do to do a tutorial on
but<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:22.340> might<00:05:23.340> do<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:23.610> later<00:05:23.760> on<00:05:24.030> once<00:05:24.660> I've

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
but I might do it later on once I've

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.990 
but I might do it later on once I've
enough<00:05:25.110> time<00:05:25.380> but<00:05:26.130> that's<00:05:26.670> all<00:05:26.820> for<00:05:26.970> now

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
enough time but that's all for now

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.470 
enough time but that's all for now
