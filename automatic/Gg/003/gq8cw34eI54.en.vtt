that if I had a hidden cloud ninja I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.770 
that if I had a hidden cloud ninja I
could<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> don't<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
use them and I could probably seal the

tree away big hint there I feel like
those<00:00:46.739> weapons<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.219> probably<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> be

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
morning define that for people because I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
morning define that for people because I
sometimes<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.340> didn't<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.879> mean

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000

sometimes I didn't know what you mean
when<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> say<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.690> um<00:00:54.840> basically<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.410> deus<00:00:55.680> ex

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
when you say that um basically a deus ex

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
when you say that um basically a deus ex
machina<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.850> basically<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.539> devices

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
machina is just basically the devices

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
machina is just basically the devices
just<00:00:58.260> sort<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> comes<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> nowhere<00:00:59.129> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
just sort of comes out of nowhere to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
just sort of comes out of nowhere to
defeat<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> bad<00:01:00.480> guy<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.199> how

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
defeat the bad guy it's going to be how

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
defeat the bad guy it's going to be how
we're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> end<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.850> story<00:01:03.090> quickly<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
we're going to end the story quickly and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.859 
we're going to end the story quickly and
swiftly<00:01:04.049> without<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:06.060> explanation<00:01:06.420> as

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
swiftly without as little explanation as

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
swiftly without as little explanation as
possible<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.340> weapons<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
possible so I just weapons could be that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
possible so I just weapons could be that
that<00:01:09.479> probably<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that probably is what they're going to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.590 
that probably is what they're going to
be<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.580> probably<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> tie<00:01:12.390> into

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
be it's probably going to tie into

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
be it's probably going to tie into
something<00:01:12.960> even<00:01:13.290> greater<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.979> they're

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
something even greater here they're

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.830 
something even greater here they're
drooly<00:01:14.760> getting<00:01:14.939> ready<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> set<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> final

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
drooly getting ready to set up the final

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.480 
drooly getting ready to set up the final
battle<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> did<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> fact<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
battle here I did like the fact that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
battle here I did like the fact that
when<00:01:17.880> Tenten<00:01:18.299> dropped<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> scroll<00:01:19.110> she

probably shit brix too but what I loved
about<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.060> scene<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:43.380> made<00:01:43.590> me<00:01:43.740> go

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
about the scene is that it made me go

about the scene is that it made me go
back<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> read<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.090> believe<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.220> 650<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
back and read I believe it was a 650 and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
back and read I believe it was a 650 and
it<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> scene<00:01:48.270> where<00:01:48.540> modera<00:01:48.899> was

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it was the scene where modera was

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
it was the scene where modera was
absorbing<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> B's<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.549> once<00:01:50.790> and

you<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.570> technically<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.230> they're<00:02:43.380> not

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you know technically so they're not

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.720 
you know technically so they're not
getting<00:02:43.710> caught<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.280> either<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
getting caught up in it either and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.370 
getting caught up in it either and
they're<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.450> witnessing<00:02:45.960> everything

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
they're just witnessing everything

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.870 
they're just witnessing everything
happening<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.430> find<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.700> interesting

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
happening and I find that interesting

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.160 
happening and I find that interesting
they<00:02:48.330> didn't<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.600> caught<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.020> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
they didn't get caught in it and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
they didn't get caught in it and
obviously<00:02:49.650> they're<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> ones<00:02:50.610> they're<00:02:50.730> going

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
obviously they're the ones they're going

to help Naruto and Sasuke fight liteon
that's<00:02:53.130> probably<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.910> happen<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:54.390> it's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that's probably going to happen but it's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.990 
that's probably going to happen but it's
been<00:02:54.690> shown<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:54.930> they're<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.470> useful

existed never existed but it's good
filler<00:06:11.490> and<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:12.360> know<00:06:12.450> I<00:06:12.480> think<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.960> author

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
filler and you know I think the author

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.620 
filler and you know I think the author
likes<00:06:13.800> 1010<00:06:14.580> he's<00:06:14.820> mentioned<00:06:15.210> before<00:06:15.330> in

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630

female<00:06:17.340> characters<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.120> draw<00:06:18.360> and<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:19.440> think

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
female characters to draw and I think

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.590 
female characters to draw and I think
this<00:06:19.830> is<00:06:20.010> an<00:06:20.130> opportunity<00:06:20.460> for<00:06:20.790> her<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.150> leave

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
this is an opportunity for her to leave

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.960 
this is an opportunity for her to leave
