there's<00:00:09.719> not<00:00:09.900> really<00:00:10.019> much<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.530> there's<00:00:11.280> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
there's not really much to it there's a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.780 
there's not really much to it there's a
piece<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.719> stiff<00:00:12.719> card<00:00:13.049> that's<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.590> taped<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
piece of stiff card that's just taped to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.609 
piece of stiff card that's just taped to
the<00:00:14.910> bed<00:00:15.120> at<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> front<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.410> where

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the bed at the front and this is where

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.010 
the bed at the front and this is where
the<00:00:16.770> parts<00:00:17.070> get<00:00:17.220> pushed<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.850> down<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the parts get pushed off down here and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.189 
the parts get pushed off down here and
that<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.890> shoots<00:00:20.160> them<00:00:20.520> down<00:00:21.080> into<00:00:22.080> this

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
that just shoots them down into this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.500 
that just shoots them down into this
tray<00:00:22.500> over<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:24.180> only<00:00:24.300> really

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
tray over here the only really

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.230 
tray over here the only really
significant<00:00:25.199> addition<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.490> aluminium

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
significant addition is this aluminium

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.380 
significant addition is this aluminium
sort<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.779> baffles<00:00:28.380> laughs<00:00:28.680> pusher<00:00:29.250> Ram<00:00:29.580> thing

sort of baffles laughs pusher Ram thing

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
sort of baffles laughs pusher Ram thing
and<00:00:30.689> could<00:00:31.230> very<00:00:31.260> easily<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> printed<00:00:32.309> part

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and could very easily be a printed part

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
and could very easily be a printed part
I<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.880> had<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.180> admin<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.690> kicking<00:00:34.020> around

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
I just had some admin and kicking around

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
I just had some admin and kicking around
it<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.469> quick<00:00:34.770> easy<00:00:34.950> way<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
it was quick easy way to do it and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.260 
it was quick easy way to do it and
that's<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.980> bolted<00:00:37.980> onto<00:00:38.250> my<00:00:38.550> ex<00:00:38.790> carriage

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that's just bolted onto my ex carriage

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.920 
that's just bolted onto my ex carriage
in<00:00:39.600> front<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.890> hot<00:00:41.070> end<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:41.969> now

in front of the hot end over there now
this<00:00:43.290> printer<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.950> heated<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> ready

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
this printer is all heated up and ready

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.860 
this printer is all heated up and ready
to<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.829> importantly<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.879> primed<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
to go and importantly I have primed the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
to go and importantly I have primed the
nozzle<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> nozzles<00:00:50.399> full<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> plastic

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
nozzle so the nozzles full of plastic

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.900 
nozzle so the nozzles full of plastic
and<00:00:51.449> its<00:00:51.600> resting<00:00:52.050> against<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> print<00:00:53.070> bed<00:00:53.280> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and its resting against the print bed so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.750 
and its resting against the print bed so
I<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.510> need<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> skirt<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.920> any<00:00:56.309> other<00:00:56.489> sort

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I don't need a skirt or any other sort

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
I don't need a skirt or any other sort
of<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.570> prime<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> nozzle<00:00:58.559> before<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
of thing to prime the nozzle before I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.130 
of thing to prime the nozzle before I
get<00:00:59.340> printed<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.329> important<00:01:00.989> because

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
get printed and that's important because

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.090 
get printed and that's important because
the<00:01:01.640> baffle<00:01:02.640> cannot<00:01:03.149> sweep<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.890> objects<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the baffle cannot sweep off objects that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
the baffle cannot sweep off objects that
are<00:01:05.220> lower<00:01:05.430> than<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
are lower than you know that have a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320 
are lower than you know that have a
lower<00:01:07.710> Zed<00:01:08.040> height<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.520> 10<00:01:08.790> millimeters

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
lower Zed height than 10 millimeters

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.719 
lower Zed height than 10 millimeters
also<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> battle<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> obviously

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
also because the battle has to obviously

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
also because the battle has to obviously
have<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.360> clearance<00:01:12.810> above<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> bed<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
have some clearance above the bed it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.380 
have some clearance above the bed it
could<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> lot<00:01:14.430> closer<00:01:14.670> than<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> have

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
could be a lot closer than what I have

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.700 
could be a lot closer than what I have
here<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:16.979> made<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:17.460> roughly<00:01:17.880> but

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
here this was very made very roughly but

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.870 
here this was very made very roughly but
printing<00:01:19.710> without<00:01:19.979> skirts<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> way

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
printing without skirts is the way

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
printing without skirts is the way
forward<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> start<00:01:22.080> print

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.100 

and<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.220> all<00:01:27.340> pretty<00:01:27.610> normal<00:01:27.790> stuff<00:01:28.119> it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
and this is all pretty normal stuff it

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.170 
and this is all pretty normal stuff it
all<00:01:29.290> just<00:01:29.650> register<00:01:30.520> its<00:01:30.640> temperatures

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
all just register its temperatures

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.210 
all just register its temperatures
should<00:01:31.540> be<00:01:31.720> up<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:31.930> temperature<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.680> it'll

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
should be up to temperature and it'll

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:43.020 
should be up to temperature and it'll
start<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.580> print<00:01:33.880> without<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.330> skirt<00:01:41.700> I've<00:01:42.700> set

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
start a print without a skirt I've set

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.300 
start a print without a skirt I've set
my<00:01:43.180> print<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.630> be<00:01:43.780> towards<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.680> front<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
my print to be towards the front of the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.670 
my print to be towards the front of the
bed<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.960> because<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.380> bit<00:01:47.500> more

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
bed just because it's a bit more

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.649 
bed just because it's a bit more
convenient<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:51.399> worth<00:01:51.759> noting<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.360> mod

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
convenient and is worth noting this mod

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.660 
convenient and is worth noting this mod
just<00:01:53.320> kind<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.530> reduce<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.340> amount<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
just kind of reduce the amount of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.330 
just kind of reduce the amount of
printable<00:01:55.090> area<00:01:55.390> on<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.229> bed<00:01:56.799> or<00:01:56.979> at<00:01:57.159> least

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
printable area on your bed or at least

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.040 
printable area on your bed or at least
the<00:01:57.610> printable<00:01:57.940> area<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.509> can<00:01:58.690> use<00:01:58.899> in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the printable area that you can use in

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.040 
the printable area that you can use in
the<00:01:59.170> automated<00:01:59.710> system<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.690> see<00:02:01.869> it's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
the automated system and you see it's

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.359 
the automated system and you see it's
just<00:02:02.110> getting<00:02:02.619> on<00:02:02.679> with<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:02.860> sprint<00:02:03.130> over

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
just getting on with it sprint over
