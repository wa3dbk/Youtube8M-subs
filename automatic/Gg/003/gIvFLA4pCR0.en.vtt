out my paper cutter to trim off all the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.590 
out my paper cutter to trim off all the
excess<00:00:56.379> area<00:00:56.800> since<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.760> pixscan<00:00:58.000> uses<00:00:58.570> a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
excess area since the pixscan uses a

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.779 
excess area since the pixscan uses a
photo<00:00:58.960> I'll<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.559> able<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.890> use<00:01:00.129> this<00:01:00.339> extra

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
photo I'll be able to use this extra

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.149 
photo I'll be able to use this extra
area<00:01:01.180> off<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.839> sides<00:01:02.079> on<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.500> different

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
area off of the sides on a different

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.490 
area off of the sides on a different
project<00:01:03.479> then<00:01:04.479> I<00:01:04.509> pulled<00:01:04.839> out<00:01:04.899> my<00:01:04.960> pic<00:01:05.259> scan

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
project then I pulled out my pic scan

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.530 
project then I pulled out my pic scan
mat<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.979> place<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.610> image<00:01:06.909> in<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.180> center<00:01:07.509> of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
mat and place the image in the center of

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.889 
mat and place the image in the center of
it<00:01:08.759> next<00:01:09.759> part<00:01:10.000> might<00:01:10.030> be<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.299> little<00:01:10.420> confusing

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
it next part might be a little confusing

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.399 
it next part might be a little confusing
but<00:01:11.530> I'm<00:01:11.649> taking<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.399> photo<00:01:12.820> with<00:01:13.149> my<00:01:13.330> iPad<00:01:13.750> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
but I'm taking a photo with my iPad the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.719 
but I'm taking a photo with my iPad the
trick<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.799> this<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.070> make<00:01:15.340> sure<00:01:15.369> there's

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
trick to this is make sure there's

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.050 
trick to this is make sure there's
plenty<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.060> light<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.600> try<00:01:17.289> to<00:01:17.350> keep<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.770> as

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
plenty of light and try to keep it as

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.680 
plenty of light and try to keep it as
balanced<00:01:19.060> as<00:01:19.180> possible<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.119> connected<00:01:22.630> my

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
balanced as possible then I connected my

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.899 
balanced as possible then I connected my
iPad<00:01:23.259> to<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.710> computer<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.369> transfer<00:01:24.789> over

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
iPad to the computer to transfer over

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.180 
iPad to the computer to transfer over
the<00:01:25.149> image<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:26.350> remembered<00:01:26.800> where<00:01:26.979> that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
the image and just remembered where that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.859 
the image and just remembered where that
folder<00:01:27.520> was<00:01:29.789> from<00:01:30.789> here<00:01:31.030> you'll<00:01:31.360> open<00:01:31.630> the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
folder was from here you'll open the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.870 
folder was from here you'll open the
pixscan<00:01:32.140> image<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.860> then<00:01:33.310> you'll<00:01:33.460> be<00:01:33.610> able<00:01:33.700> to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
pixscan image and then you'll be able to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.999 
pixscan image and then you'll be able to
hit<00:01:34.000> import<00:01:34.479> file<00:01:34.720> import<00:01:35.530> pick<00:01:35.710> scanned

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
hit import file import pick scanned

from here we'll load the image into the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.520 
from here we'll load the image into the
software<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.630> not<00:01:46.840> going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.110> be<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.319> best

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
software it's not going to be the best

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.770 
software it's not going to be the best
quality<00:01:47.710> photo<00:01:48.310> but<00:01:48.940> really<00:01:49.299> that's<00:01:49.539> not<00:01:49.659> a

you just need to see a basic outline of
where<00:01:52.929> all<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.229> your<00:01:53.350> images<00:01:53.740> are<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:56.380> gonna

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
where all of your images are I'm gonna

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.380 
where all of your images are I'm gonna
fast-forward<00:01:56.950> through<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.430> part<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.880> ended

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
fast-forward through this part I ended

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.630 
fast-forward through this part I ended
up<00:01:58.479> using<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:58.899> tighter<00:01:59.170> offset<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.310> you'll<00:02:00.460> see

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
up using a tighter offset so you'll see

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.039 
up using a tighter offset so you'll see
me<00:02:00.789> go<00:02:00.909> back<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.329> do<00:02:01.450> all<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.630> these<00:02:01.810> shapes

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
me go back and do all of these shapes

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.859 
me go back and do all of these shapes
again<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.880> now<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:04.149> time<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.479> trace<00:02:04.659> the
