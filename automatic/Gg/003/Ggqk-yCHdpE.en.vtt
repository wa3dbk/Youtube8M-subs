00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 want to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 hello to you, denis, and today we have 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 a review of a wonderful application under 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 Grave Name 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.570
 of course you heard and saw a lot 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.010
 applications think even used those 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.470
 which you can edit your 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.930
 photos put different text on them 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.360
 and wear other photos on them but I 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.400
 I think you have not all met the application 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.540
 which helps you do the same 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 only with video 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.350
 and then for example run it in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.940
 instagram let's see this application 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.550
 called she gravel run it what 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.610
 we see on the first screen such 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.060
 small splash likes 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.670
 that you can and you can 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.200
 few things firstly go to it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 page instagram 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.220
 the developer itself is this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 apps and see there videos 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 which he does can create new 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.710
 a project that I will do now and you can 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.050
 for example let's go back 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 read what this application is with 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.900
 how to eat it and how to use it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 let's create a new project which 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.850
 The options here are generally let me have you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.380
 Little 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 the options here are a few you or you 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.390
 just do the usual 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.659
 project without everything you can do 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.970
 project with the application of some effects of the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.350
 there is a certain effect of accidentally knife 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.420
 effects here by the way enough 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 many let's count how many times 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:18.060
 two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.480
 In general, there are a lot of them here. 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.900
 let's choose this one although I donâ€™t 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.140
 I don't like it very much and what is it about you? 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.150
 constantly grown let's choose let's say 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.480
 let's say and 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:39.640
 with those legs told let's say 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.400
 here is this project love love yes I am with him 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:51.569
 a small piece of video and in it like 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.569
 horizontal and position and shoot a video 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.840
 we got a few seconds so we 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.579
 still shoot finish this band 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.569
 green appears it means that 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:08.079
 you as if you shot a video push the house 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:12.209
 continue ok ok with us like 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.209
 render something like that video and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.459
 we fall I said we fall before we fall 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.129
 on the screen where you can actually carry 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.739
 what music or lyrics to your 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:34.510
 video let's put music music 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:38.230
 music so let's open music 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.690
 choose some song don't know what 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:46.209
 can we clean? 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.540
 now click on the plus sign and what we can 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.540
 choose 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:58.389
 so you can apply some 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.359
 a phrase that is already here for example 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.190
 something like this and this but mary 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.120
 Krismas we definitely do not need at the extreme 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.569
 Now words are already something like spring 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.699
 you can put text text can 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.560
 apply absolutely any, but then again 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:17.680
 what annoys me often if you will 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.019
 enter Russian letters you can not 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.150
 choose then some cool font 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.650
 let's not enter anything yet 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.729
 we got the word love 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.150
 for some reason the fishing is just not completely so 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.130
 we can talk clipart put 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.240
 cliparts here is really not about not 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.949
 said that very much is not the greatest 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.220
 the amount that I saw but in my opinion 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.460
 this is enough even more than 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.260
 absolutely enough let's 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.889
 here's a thumbs up and by the way, put your fingers 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.249
 top thumbs up 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.449
 and put it well I don't know where 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:58.810
 here love 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.060
 and instead we will have such a thing 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.069
 can of course change horizontally and 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.550
 vertically twist twist as you want 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.699
 You can also select select 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.680
 a certain part of the video while doing so 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:17.289
 goes and for example on this plot 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.310
 set aside clipart but I don't know 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:24.460
 let's cross the typical sex with him 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.180
 and sex oh yeah all you six are right necks 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:32.469
 8 conspire and strike out love like this 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:38.050
 Now let's try this whole thing 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:40.210
 reproduce see what happens so 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.770
 well now let's check which video 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.819
 we succeeded and that we are with you 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.819
 actually made 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.570
 That means that we have left that is 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.040
 passed the letters love thumbs up and hope 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.670
 youtube will not ban us for this 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.200
 short excerpt with music nothing 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.310
 scary also you can add on 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.830
 for example, another video or import from 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:16.480
 libraries well after all of course 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.520
 you can create new videos 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.100
 have you can trim it impose 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.670
 completely different music add more in 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.120
 general here you are editing the main 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.910
 video 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.150
 and here cosmetic treatment is already underway 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.070
 next let's try to save or 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.910
 You can immediately for example, I can fill 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.600
 save 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.610
 let's make our public we can 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.750
 we can keep everything on camera 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.970
 run facebook immediately on youtube 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.940
 general very interesting well let's not 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.640
 we will write nothing and save to the camera 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.700
 we will now have apparently 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.980
 Rendered video wait until she 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.200
 Render and wait is very 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:04.630
 a little and then actually see 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.270
 like what we did after 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.730
 we downloaded video arises here 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.660
 tick is one thing clear mean 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:15.760
 that your video is rendered on and saved to 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.500
 your photos are also such a tick 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.220
 straighten out if you are on youtube Start 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.890
 facebook let's say you can get out of here 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.860
 you can continue to do anything at all 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.690
 come out see here saved 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.160

 in the end we got it 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.460
 project 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.460
