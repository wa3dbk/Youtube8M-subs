00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and quite an odd design well technically

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.469 
and quite an odd design well technically
this<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.170> seat<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.210> why

this could be a seat I don't know why

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.499 
this could be a seat I don't know why
robots<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> planet<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.700> inhabited<00:01:24.330> by

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
robots from a planet not inhabited by

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.100 
robots from a planet not inhabited by
humans<00:01:24.780> would<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.500> seats<00:01:26.180> but<00:01:27.180> who<00:01:27.420> am<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
humans would have seats but who am I to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.240 
humans would have seats but who am I to
argue<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:29.930> spin<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.700> front<00:01:33.060> sphere<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
argue right spin the front sphere and I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.149 
argue right spin the front sphere and I
must<00:01:35.490> admit<00:01:35.640> i<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.570> idea<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
must admit i like the idea of

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
must admit i like the idea of
translucent<00:01:38.159> red<00:01:38.250> wheels<00:01:38.810> it's<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.049> nice

thing i really like that looks great
almost<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.409> Tron

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
almost in the way of it like to Tron

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.819 
almost in the way of it like to Tron
life<00:01:46.890> cycle<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.399> adults<00:01:47.720> otherwise<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.049> mode

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
life cycle as adults otherwise this mode

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.030 
life cycle as adults otherwise this mode
is<00:01:50.270> well<00:01:51.270> where<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> hell<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> steering

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is well where the hell is the steering

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.889 
is well where the hell is the steering
wheel<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.490> including<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> seat<00:01:54.390> why<00:01:54.720> not

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
wheel if you're including a seat why not

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
wheel if you're including a seat why not
include<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.530> steering<00:01:56.009> wheel<00:01:57.500> yeah<00:01:58.500> no<00:01:59.490> logic

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
include a steering wheel yeah no logic

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:08.660 
include a steering wheel yeah no logic
in<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.240> also<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:01.729> 2005<00:02:04.310> 1994<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.039> what

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
in here also look 2005 1994 this is what

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.800 
in here also look 2005 1994 this is what
I<00:02:08.849> call<00:02:09.780> reverts<00:02:10.619> evolution<00:02:11.810> great

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
I call reverts evolution great

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.650 
I call reverts evolution great

just<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.870> motorcycle<00:02:16.590> oh<00:02:17.660> poor<00:02:18.660> designers<00:02:19.140> what

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
just a motorcycle oh poor designers what

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.380 
just a motorcycle oh poor designers what
is<00:02:19.470> happening<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.400> you're<00:02:20.940> trying<00:02:21.210> to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
is happening to you you're trying to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.600 
is happening to you you're trying to
give<00:02:21.660> us<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.350> worst<00:02:22.590> piece<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.540> plastic<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.610> I

give us the worst piece of plastic and I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
give us the worst piece of plastic and I
think<00:02:27.360> designers<00:02:27.900> were<00:02:28.110> quite<00:02:28.320> aware<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
think designers were quite aware that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.590 
think designers were quite aware that
they<00:02:29.010> are<00:02:29.040> creating<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.550> rather<00:02:29.700> odd<00:02:30.030> toy

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
they are creating a rather odd toy

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.950

however I can I know looking at the
cyber<00:02:34.200> key<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.740> standard<00:02:37.740> cyber<00:02:38.100> key

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
cyber key this is standard cyber key

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
cyber key this is standard cyber key
possibly<00:02:39.930> from<00:02:40.680> some<00:02:41.250> deluxe<00:02:41.610> toy<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.090> most

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
possibly from some deluxe toy so most

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.900

that<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.770> Ron's<00:02:47.580> X<00:02:47.790> key<00:02:49.370> see<00:02:50.370> any

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
that and this is Ron's X key see any

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.520 
that and this is Ron's X key see any
difference<00:02:52.010> yes<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.270> completely<00:02:54.870> silly

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
difference yes this is completely silly

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.790 
difference yes this is completely silly
and<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.360> can't<00:02:57.360> explain<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> only

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and I can't explain it this is the only

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.980 
and I can't explain it this is the only

why<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.240> podium<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.959> being<00:03:07.170> subtle

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
why is this the a podium of being subtle

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.230 
why is this the a podium of being subtle
about<00:03:07.680> how<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.100> designers<00:03:08.670> did<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.209> to

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
about how the designers did not like to

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.890 
about how the designers did not like to
tie<00:03:09.630> themselves<00:03:10.310> all<00:03:11.310> right<00:03:11.459> low<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.420> that's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
tie themselves all right low but that's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
tie themselves all right low but that's
what<00:03:13.130> Ron<00:03:14.130> zach<00:03:14.310> has<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.580> kind

rather average if not bad toy anyway
let's<00:03:22.769> transform<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.550> bad<00:03:23.850> boy<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:25.610> see

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
let's transform this bad boy and see

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.210 
let's transform this bad boy and see
what<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.330> get<00:03:27.570> from<00:03:27.840> robot<00:03:28.320> mode<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
what we can get from robot mode the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.750 
what we can get from robot mode the
transformation<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.790> very<00:03:29.970> simple<00:03:30.420> very

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
transformation is very simple very

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.740 
transformation is very simple very
simple<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:34.800> weed<00:03:35.510> it'll<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.540> be
