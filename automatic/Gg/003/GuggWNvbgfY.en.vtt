00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.399 
try to wipe off as much mascara as you
can<00:01:32.100> otherwise<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> wet

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
can otherwise it can it's like a wet

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.039 
can otherwise it can it's like a wet
moist<00:01:34.890> consistency<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.570> makes<00:01:36.900> your

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
moist consistency so it makes your

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
moist consistency so it makes your
lashes<00:01:37.200> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> clump<00:01:38.159> together<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.060> if

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
lashes kind of clump together some so if

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.640 
lashes kind of clump together some so if
you<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> lashes<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> big

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you have a lot of lashes it's not a big

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
you have a lot of lashes it's not a big
problem<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> few

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
problem but if you have kind of a few

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.749 
problem but if you have kind of a few
lashes<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.430> come

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
lashes like I do they kind of all come

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
lashes like I do they kind of all come
together<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> forms<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
together and it forms like you know like

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.179 
together and it forms like you know like
five<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.790> six<00:01:47.820> big<00:01:48.689> lashes<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.799> actual

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
five or six big lashes the actual

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.639 
five or six big lashes the actual
mascara<00:01:50.700> though<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.869> dark<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
mascara though it's like really dark and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.069 
mascara though it's like really dark and
it<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.340> makes<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.880> lashes<00:01:54.060> stand<00:01:54.720> out

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
it really makes your lashes stand out

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.080 
it really makes your lashes stand out
it's<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> put<00:01:56.880> more

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it's just you have to kind of put more

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.300 
it's just you have to kind of put more
time<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.360> effort<00:01:57.750> into<00:01:58.110> actually<00:01:58.350> separating

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
time and effort into actually separating

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
time and effort into actually separating
them<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.790> kind<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> stings<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
them all which kind of stings and of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
them all which kind of stings and of
course<00:02:01.590> another<00:02:01.920> downside<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.820> can't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
course another downside is you can't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.490 
course another downside is you can't
really<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.869> your<00:02:03.990> bottom<00:02:04.259> lashes

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
really use this for your bottom lashes

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
really use this for your bottom lashes
because<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.549> wand<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.420> big<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.899> would

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
because if the wand is so big it would

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
because if the wand is so big it would
just<00:02:07.200> kind<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.500> smudge<00:02:07.799> everywhere<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
just kind of smudge everywhere now this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.960 
just kind of smudge everywhere now this
mess

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
mess

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.480 
mess
