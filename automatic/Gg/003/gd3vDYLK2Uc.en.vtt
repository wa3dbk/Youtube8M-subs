squeeze yes squeeze this is the
intensity<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.490> watch<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.210> form<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
intensity right here watch the form it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.990 
intensity right here watch the form it
is<00:01:18.840> still<00:01:19.080> perfect<00:01:19.619> come<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.580> comes<00:01:20.850> the

is still perfect come on here comes the
intensity<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.930> makes<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
intensity this is what makes the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.920 
intensity this is what makes the
difference<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.820> extra<00:01:24.210> come<00:01:24.810> on

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
difference this little bit extra come on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.219 
difference this little bit extra come on
let's<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.680> three<00:01:26.180> squeezing<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.479> slow<00:01:27.720> I've

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
let's go three squeezing down slow I've

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.530 
let's go three squeezing down slow I've
gotcha<00:01:28.500> squeezing<00:01:29.490> down<00:01:29.610> slow<00:01:30.060> come<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.390> one

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
gotcha squeezing down slow come on one

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.850 
gotcha squeezing down slow come on one
one<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.110> number<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.470> squeezing<00:01:32.100> ie

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
one more for number one squeezing ie

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.469 
one more for number one squeezing ie
that's<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> guys<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that's the way you do it guys up the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
that's the way you do it guys up the
intensity<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.409> everybody<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.280> with
