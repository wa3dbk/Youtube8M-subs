00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.420 
and working with what we got here
because<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.830> think<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> most

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
because I think that's the most

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.910 
because I think that's the most
important<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.830> never

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
important bit because you just never

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
important bit because you just never
know<00:01:26.280> where<00:01:26.490> you're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.939> able<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
know where you're going to be able to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899
