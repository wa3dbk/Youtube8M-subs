first<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.090> all<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.510> find<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.080> looks<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.470> nice

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
first of all I find it looks really nice

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
first of all I find it looks really nice
because<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.100> has<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> same<00:00:23.640> color<00:00:23.910> coding

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
because it has the same color coding

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.710 
because it has the same color coding
this<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.400> regular<00:00:26.400> 20<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.320> Coleman<00:00:28.340> cooler

saw Pat saw and he kind of saw a bit of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
saw Pat saw and he kind of saw a bit of
velcro<00:00:41.660> put<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.780> popular<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:44.390> let's<00:00:45.390> pretty

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
velcro put this popular and let's pretty

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
velcro put this popular and let's pretty
much<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.100> pick<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> up

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
much it if you really want to pick it up

much it if you really want to pick it up
a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.730> more<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
a little more you can get a bit of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.119 
a little more you can get a bit of
insulation<00:00:49.590> foam<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.910> inject<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> into

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
insulation foam and inject this into

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.250 
insulation foam and inject this into
this<00:00:53.600> lid<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.770> make<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.520> work<00:00:56.760> even

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
this lid and then make it work even

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.959 
this lid and then make it work even
better

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
better

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
better
the<00:00:59.969> Nomikos<00:01:00.660> neck<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.280> 2<00:01:02.280> inches<00:01:02.489> wide<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.320> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the Nomikos neck is 2 inches wide and so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840 
the Nomikos neck is 2 inches wide and so
when<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.799> cut<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> hole<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.369> want<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
when we cut a hole we want to make it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.020 
when we cut a hole we want to make it
just<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.720> 2<00:01:06.869> inches<00:01:06.990> wide<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.640> last<00:01:08.850> thing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
just over 2 inches wide the last thing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
just over 2 inches wide the last thing
about<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.420> silicon<00:01:09.810> thing<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.320> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
about the silicon thing is that it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.719 
about the silicon thing is that it's
going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.010> under<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> lid<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
going to be just under the lid and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
going to be just under the lid and
sealing<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.689> off<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.950> nice

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
sealing it off which is you know a nice

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.359 
sealing it off which is you know a nice
little<00:01:14.270> bonus<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.500> stops<00:01:16.770> evaporation

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
little bonus and so it stops evaporation

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.420 
little bonus and so it stops evaporation
the<00:01:18.299> lid<00:01:18.869> itself<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> hole<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the lid itself will have a hole that is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.660 
the lid itself will have a hole that is
just<00:01:20.700> over<00:01:20.880> 2<00:01:21.000> inches<00:01:21.150> wide<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.840> talk<00:01:22.619> about

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
just over 2 inches wide and I talk about

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
just over 2 inches wide and I talk about
more<00:01:23.670> less<00:01:23.820> exactly<00:01:24.240> 3<00:01:24.509> inches<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.020> depth<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
more less exactly 3 inches of depth and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
more less exactly 3 inches of depth and
I<00:01:26.340> find<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.670> works<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.090> well<00:01:27.299> because

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
I find that works really well because

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
I find that works really well because
it'll<00:01:28.229> nicely<00:01:28.650> fit<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.939> still<00:01:30.150> have

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it'll nicely fit in and you still have

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.850 
it'll nicely fit in and you still have
enough<00:01:30.479> space<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> remove<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> lid<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
enough space to remove the lid and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
enough space to remove the lid and
there's<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.000> much<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> operation<00:01:33.689> going

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
there's not that much of operation going

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.660 
there's not that much of operation going
on

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
on

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.540 
on
if<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.420> want<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.630> cut<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.840> out<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.400> use<00:01:37.430> a

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
if you want to cut it out you can use a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.090 
if you want to cut it out you can use a
handsaw<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.360> find<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.050> bandsaw<00:01:39.409> works<00:01:39.920> really

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
handsaw I find a bandsaw works really

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.300 
handsaw I find a bandsaw works really
well<00:01:40.310> it's<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.330> clean<00:01:41.540> fast<00:01:41.810> cut<00:01:42.080> please<00:01:43.040> use

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
well it's a clean fast cut please use

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.540 
well it's a clean fast cut please use
protection<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.420> don't<00:01:44.659> get<00:01:44.780> hurt<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.550> if

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
protection so you don't get hurt and if

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.980 
protection so you don't get hurt and if
you<00:01:46.670> don't<00:01:46.820> have<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.000> bandsaw<00:01:47.390> maybe<00:01:47.630> ask<00:01:47.869> a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
you don't have a bandsaw maybe ask a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.050 
you don't have a bandsaw maybe ask a
friend<00:01:48.110> who<00:01:48.680> might<00:01:48.890> have<00:01:49.010> all<00:01:49.640> right
