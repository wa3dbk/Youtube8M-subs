00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello andrew tkachenko today 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.800
 we'll talk on the topic of a doctor 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.860
 gardens yes that is 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.960
 more people 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.110
 their clients and so come to us they want 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.349
 some simplicity that is they want 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.460
 some kind of liquid yes that is 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.930
 fertilizer for the plant to grow 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.390
 furious they constantly ask and 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.750
 even if I donâ€™t fit, itâ€™s just 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 either running husband take on 1 blue either 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 Again, I repeat some pockmarked 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.170
 black liquids to advise yourself 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.240
 if you grow seedlings somewhere on 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.850
 balcony poured over the greenhouse which is 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.340
 some shading in which there is a place 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.579
 which little sun does not fall 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.640
 use black liquids 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.380
 no matter what it's called 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 absolutely not important because everything is 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:10.270
 these drugs are all you see black 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.100
 made on the basis of humate this is a hood 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.969
 either from biohumus or peat more often 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.070
 total peat 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.229
 that is, they are all made based on 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.750
 humic acid humic acid is very 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.270
 strongly give a surge of growth 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.159
 at Christmas and three times the tops of it there 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.960
 your plant begins to grow actively and 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.320
 insufficient sun conditions if you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.090
 crustaceans seedlings on the balcony or here's how 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.729
 here in the north almost all of the sink they 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.290
 grow Khanty-Mansiysk either it 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.570
 greenhouse somewhere with shading 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.729
 then your times she starts to reach out and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.689
 you go to the store and these give me 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.299
 anything served did not drag much and 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.420
 It turns out after your mistake that 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.010
 you bought drugs there which was 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.680
 written for seedlings before you go for 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.520
 drugs some trace for example or 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.540
 tilt which will slow down the draw 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.500
 that is, you first gave a stimulator 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.600
 reproach and then start stopping 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.730
 the essence of the proposal is best not to be lazy 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.450
 yes it is clear that fluid is convenient two 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.840
 cap on the bucket and we all watered 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.170
 militia militia which will be the militia 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.190
 written for seedlings or water off there 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.740
 rosewood seedlings 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.170
 each country has its own manufacturers 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.250
 which make a feature for seedlings 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.890
 crystalline fertilizers in that they 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.760
 if liquids are focused on 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.490
 nitrogen and humate that is exactly on growth 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.470
 then in crystalline fertilizers to do 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.930
 more emphasis on the fact that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.760
 potassium content from pay attention 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.090
 here if 26 percent in this and here in 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.620
 this can write in this we can not 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.170
 don't see here a duck of twenty 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.080
 percent meaning task 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.540
 on the contrary, nitrogen and humate do not expand 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.280
 the cage they inflate and its plant 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.470
 visually very quickly Nosta 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.709
 potassium in turn drowns out 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.560
 intercellular juice it decreases decreases 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.030
 each cell reduces the movement of juices and 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.340
 due to this, your seedlings grow 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.890
 slowly it grows time grows more 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.530
 chunky they grow better root 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.269
 the system therefore 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 no need to chase simplicity 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.459
 chase some liquids 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.220
 in the following videos we will outline how we 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.040
 we prepare to prepare correctly and soil for 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.420
 that there are no processes at all 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.540
 stretching was not here these extra's 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.560
 movements 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.049
 and but since we have already done then once already 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.780
 she already stretches just use this 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.159
 recommendations for the future subscribe 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.980
 there will be a lot more on our channel 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:58.180
 interesting videos ask questions what 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.739
 that's all goodbye 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.739
 second happiness is our destiny
