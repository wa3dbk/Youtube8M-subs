number<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.600> page<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> we'll<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:45.150> one

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
number for that page so we'll do one

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.760 
number for that page so we'll do one
through<00:02:45.660> 28<00:02:46.110> first<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> random.org<00:02:48.780> and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
through 28 first go to random.org and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.250 
through 28 first go to random.org and
then<00:02:50.190> one<00:02:50.400> through<00:02:50.670> 28<00:02:51.090> here<00:02:51.360> once<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.660> camera

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
then one through 28 here once a camera

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.190 
then one through 28 here once a camera
focuses<00:02:52.880> 1<00:02:53.880> through<00:02:54.120> 28<00:02:55.700> looks<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.940> page<00:02:57.270> 27

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
focuses 1 through 28 looks like page 27

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.290 
focuses 1 through 28 looks like page 27
so<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.560> someone<00:02:59.190> who<00:02:59.250> commented<00:02:59.850> almost<00:03:00.150> as

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
