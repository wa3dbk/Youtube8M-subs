00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello what such a community of microbes 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 youtube I hope it's happening very well 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.839
 my expert freedom of two and I was 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.670
 we are in a new video tutorial and what 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.480
 is what we are going to see in this video 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.580
 it really is something very simple what 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.260
 let's see is how to teleport in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.850
 micros of the xbox presents and I guess that 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.780
 it's the same way for playstation3 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.429
 okay 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.050
 First of all this video is extremely 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.240
 easy really does not have enough 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.380
 science the teleport but there 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.759
 many people who do not know yet 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 so why am I doing this video 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.619
 to make things easier ok very well 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.210
 let's start very well as they could 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 see what the beginning of the video was 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.910
 activate the privileges of games 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.010
 this is extremely important because 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 good because when activating privileges 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.019
 of games you're going to unlock the ability 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.699
 to fly if you are a moderator 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.960
 ability to transport what is what 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.280
 we want in this video and that's why it's 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 extremely important to activate the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.359
 host privileges ok also something else 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.739
 important is that by activating the 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.160
 house privileges you will not be left 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 classified in the markers that are 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.219
 when they are killed with their blocks the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 travel how many mined when time 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.890
 played and we will not be able to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.739
 unlock achievements already in this 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.300
 is to enable host privileges is 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.229
 basically how to put a world in 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.990
 creative 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.150
 then this world is never going 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.380
 to be able to do the things that I already said 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.400
 so then think about it well before 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.340
 activate this to me really does not matter 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.660
 but it's fine very well other than 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.040
 let's do right now is how they could see 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.440
 I'm already on the split screen because 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.790
 good because I do not have a goal I can not 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.200
 do with someone xbox live but 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.479
 it really is the same to do it for 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.680
 export what to do on the screen 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.030
 divided or that is then the same 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.190
 boy can see what I'm doing is 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.479
 activate moderator privileges to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.660
 the other person so that this person 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.100
 can teleport to your liking ok if 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.509
 not you can not teleport but 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.320
 well we'll only see a little later 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.610
 okay 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.960
 here as you can see I'm going to activate what 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.580
 what would be the privileges of moderator 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770
 to this person and I'm going to activate the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.060
 checkbox that says teleporting 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.380
 it is extremely important that they activate this 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.789
 box if not equal it will not be able to 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.490
 do even moderator 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.660
 ok well after doing this what 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.880
 let's do with the second control is 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.500
 when the pirate control went out 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.229
 he also said these meters lenses the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.429
 world but since I put the batteries and now 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.679
 what we are going to do with the second 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.840
 control with the second second player 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.789
 that now the moderator is selecting 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.050
 in the game options that are the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.149
 main we are going to put 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.590
 teleport the player and once 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.360
 let's give it there let's select the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.370
 player to which we want to export 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
 here as you can see I did it and so 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.050
 well this is basically what it would be 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.610
 teleport from one person or another 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.200
 but hey what happens if he does not want to give 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.299
 the privileges of moderator to someone 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.769
 because you do not want to be 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.049
 teletransports block or that returns to 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.440
 things but good what you can do 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.510
 it is without being able to put the privileges of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.129
 moderator to another person because you yourself 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.959
 you can make it teleports 7 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.120
 because you who created the world are already 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.079
 the moderator by default that here as 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.019
 can see what will be like the 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.459
 player 1 is to put house options and in the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.319
 box up down they say of 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.760
 transport towards me I will select 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.260
 the player that I want to teleport 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.700
 towards my position and basically good 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.230
 this the video really is very thing 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.099
 simple and any doubt comment 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.840
