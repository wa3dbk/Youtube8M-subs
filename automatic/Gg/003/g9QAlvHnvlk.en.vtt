00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:07.080
 So the king is cool, he's got a new one. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 updated funk out pains 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.079
 mixed with the sick smacks west 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.590
 which is an electronic battery rolan 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.140
 that is to look at giving very dirty is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.229
 connected fast in the trap season 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.640
 is linked to the ampa a very dirty song 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.790
 very heavy 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.530
 remembers some of the steppe also mixes 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.189
 also the stable dollar 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.360
 I threw it out today and gave it to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.360
 thank god it was very good 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.120
 mostly coming back with with the back 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.480
 of the farmhouse black 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:05.150
 the head of gelatin who has touched 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.090
 several cities in Brazil, and several 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.000
 Northeast travel has already opened several shows 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.590
 in the galera mass of rap is also that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.490
 it was these experiences 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.400
 then in relation to the northeast 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.810
 I felt at home reef type at 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.890
 Northeast capital then what I 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.170
 were with smaller places more 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.290
 each time rap is expanding more 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.210
 the guys are accepting more because 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.950
 northeast is very forró braga these 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.520
 things are not sony then periphery in 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.710
 Northeast is braga ó it is beginning there the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.190
 rap the guys are starting to reap 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.900
 better then northeast or speak Swiss 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.660
 deat are two places which is another 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.280
 Another world, you know, you can not 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.330
 compare with reef 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.739
 there business happens here we are 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.750

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.270
 we make people love the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.270
 stuff no right wrist to my bag 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.660
 People would make their pulse because the pulse 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.660
 still pulses 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.680
 of this style of sound is to grow more docile 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.710
 play has some preference 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.790
 Thanks, I've always really liked pain. 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.870
 to those who are a rap style of their 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.430
 United States is heavier and such 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.070
 lately I've identified a lot 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.160
 with trip music because it mixes odors 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:48.240
 out a little too with the steppe each 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.420
 even electronic music DJs are 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.420

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 another and I like him very much 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.080

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.910
 I listen to a lot of Brazilian national rap. 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.430
 whole lot like the guys are 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.090
 evolving much of the greatest value 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:14.430
 to quote a national rap 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.510

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:26.790

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:45.950
