 provided by intersport thank you 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.580
 little description linked and there 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.119
 There is also a movie to play 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.119
 you have a look here then the shoe 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.080
 even lower by Bernadette and Sergio 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.700
 Buskies of Barcelona playing with the cr 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.680
 and guest is the shoe the red black 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.809
 coloring is only available at intersport 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 available nowhere else 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.700
 and who his shoes his 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.070
 customize black or red jersey 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.869
 want for this show is perfect and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.830
 he needs that shoe is just that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.110
 perfect is well and fairly with the first 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.399
 Very good the material looks very 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 high quality and that is a ctr times 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.399
 times a something other than the wakeboard 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.530
 puppy or its underscored because so 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.860
 I always find a puppy but increase 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.430
 is also getting boring at the moment 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:48.690
 shoe costs 100 euro so 99 95 exactly 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:54.750
 I'll tell you the shoe here first 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.390
 there is disease on the back of the shoe 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.950
 is a novel lightweight upper material 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.960
 and that should improve the ball feeling 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.160
 and also offer a better fit 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.899
 on the shoe are different 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.769
 built-in surface elements 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.970
 I can show you that 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.959
 dotted here then the mic 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.959
 sign with front for show 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:34.230
 the material mix air holes in it is too 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.900
 wait here and here 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 here is the name of the tool ctr 360 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:48.930
 and here's a little longer marc 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:52.670
 sign as you have already seen 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.459
 probably here are such 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.560
 surfaces 2d control panel help the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.299
 For example, one of adidas products 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.930
 the label scans and they stand for one 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.040
 accept clean and donate spies 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.910
 we are here in the red and black 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.910
 area before 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.489
 the heel is very well padded so 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.140
 that's very important to me because of me 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.360
 have problems with the heel and was 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.799
 already operated 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.209
 and yes that 's really very comfortable 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.819
 back and I used to have a lot too 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.040
 problems with shoes in which the verse 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.040
 was very hard and that it was this 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.859
 Study not available here is still 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.280
 with me already at the inner part of the 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:46.250
 Finally there is one more here 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:50.989
 Insole 63 in it that a bva 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.139
 insole which reduces the cleats 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.940
 and ever proud 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.760
 So here you are the bottom of 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.819
 shoe he also found it more if it was not 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.239
 so well that looks very well designed 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.859
 for me it looks pretty good here 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:15.299
 behind and black orange fits well here 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:17.370
 and I suspect that the stollen that he 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.160
 with these stollen much more holder 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.930
 that with every material or victory 3f t 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.850
 model 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:32.020
 because it's just a lot longer and longer 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:32.020
 even more stable are longer to show 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:53.750
 I'll say the shoes 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:57.440
 as soon as you look and last but not least 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.360
 the shoe of the shoe me the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.830
 perfect school for the ambitious 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.720
 player looking for 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.470
 extraordinary ball control and 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.039
 driving force for hard and natural 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.160
 soil conditions and the test video 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.599
 So turn it on tomorrow and shop at 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.560
