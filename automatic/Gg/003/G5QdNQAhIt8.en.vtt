00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello this day let's do this 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:11.490
 Napkin holder about 1000 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 and that looks like a nine 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 let's think about once hello this is the 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.590
 Napkin holder that we are going to decorate has 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.290
 swans but they will not see 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.510
 well this is a leaf of foami 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.070
 iris color diamond 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.070
 I'm going to put it upside down 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.640
 I'll position it here 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 at the border 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 flush 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.390
 and with a pencil 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.960
 draw a line here 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.309
 about a centimeter from my napkin ring 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.309
 to make it wider 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.979
 and I'm going to cut two pieces like this two 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.609
 half moons I already have these two 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.609
 half moons 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.980
 with the back 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.990
 I can dial to guide me 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.990
 some waves like that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.390
 all over the shore and then I'll remember them 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.490
 Now if you have very good hand because 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.560
 they can do it by free hand and with it 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.829
 it will be very beautiful there are also scissors that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 they have curved shapes if so 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.210
 it is not easy 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.280
 and the case is to obtain 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.280
 these waves up here 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.830
 on the other hand I have a rectangle of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.870
 foami that fits exactly in the background 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.440
 of the napkin ring and I'm going to hit it with 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.440
 silicone 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.660
 staying like this 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.660
 ah 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.150
 just below these probes I'm going to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.990
 mark a line gently with the pencil 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.990
 to guide me 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:41.120
 and on this line I'm going to paste 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:45.350
 these gold and silver laces symbolize 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.720
 prosperity for the couple who get married 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.720
 I'm going to stick them to contours 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 / I'm doing as little ones for 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.670
 that I see that the thickness of the two 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.460
 cords soon soon before it 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.460
 dry and work is impossible 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.350
 I have it there 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:24.490
 that stays stuck well pegadito 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.490
 there is that cute 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.019
 why 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.620
 as you see this lace fraying so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.000
 Quick 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.000
 that there are lost 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.120
 obvious that same thing I'm going to do here I'm going to 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.640
 do the same as here then that in the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.850
 another ok 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.850
 very well 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.330
 well then 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.069
 over here with the pencil I can design 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:09.359
 some scrolls or 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.359
 with a free lines a heart 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.620
 what I want with the little dots 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.620
 I'm going to be making a random figure 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.730
 why it does not stay like this 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.980
 I'm going to take a snacks 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.580
 and I'll drill in where I made every 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.580
 dot 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.120
 if the snack does not come out after it pushes 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.900
 with a head with a needle and it comes out 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.900
 and so I will go 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.770
 calando 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.729
 see here 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.809
 here in the morsels are inside 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.809
 a little 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.540
 each puff must make a quantity 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.620
 can write the name of the couple 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.620
 I will love you forever 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.720
 never have to add whatever 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.880
 and so we are going to draw whatever we want 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.160
 I did not tell you but here are the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.160
 I gave them a little hole 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.590
 I'll put 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.330
 silly kohn 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.330
 here on this shore 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.890
 down 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.029
 and in the poor swans 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.610
 I'll put it flush here 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.560
 and last part is a decoration that to the 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.900
 once serves to hide these points that 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:33.689
 it is fraying this is a clean 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.830
 pipes of the weird long hair 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.090
 with one is not enough 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.139
 I'm going to fold right in the middle 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.139
 I will tell you 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.860
 each one of these is going to be going to put it 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.860
 here at the base 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.460
 here I go 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.590
 nice simple 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:32.510
 tender youth 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:34.820
 what a wonder what you think you liked 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.770
