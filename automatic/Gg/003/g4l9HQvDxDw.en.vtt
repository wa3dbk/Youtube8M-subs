00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
these bumpers and install the bars and

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.830 
these bumpers and install the bars and
tighten<00:03:53.650> them<00:03:53.709> down<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.850> cut<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> dual<00:03:55.360> mortise

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
tighten them down to cut a dual mortise

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.750 
tighten them down to cut a dual mortise
and<00:03:55.989> tenon<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.769> we<00:03:57.070> do<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.340> mark<00:03:57.640> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and tenon all we do is mark the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.840 
and tenon all we do is mark the
positions<00:03:58.269> at<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> Tenon's<00:03:58.959> on<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.470> stock<00:03:59.850> then

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
positions at a Tenon's on the stock then

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.300 
positions at a Tenon's on the stock then
we<00:04:01.030> snap<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.510> sighting<00:04:01.959> reticle<00:04:02.470> into<00:04:02.830> place

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.030 

then<00:04:07.270> I<00:04:07.390> position<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.959> table<00:04:08.349> so<00:04:08.560> deciding

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
then I position the table so deciding

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.160 
then I position the table so deciding
ridicule<00:04:09.459> is<00:04:09.760> over<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.209> left<00:04:10.450> side<00:04:10.660> tenon

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
ridicule is over to the left side tenon

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.220 
ridicule is over to the left side tenon
mark<00:04:12.150> because<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.330> Tenon's<00:04:13.720> are<00:04:13.840> next<00:04:14.080> to

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
mark because the Tenon's are next to

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.590 
mark because the Tenon's are next to
each<00:04:14.349> other<00:04:14.530> crossed<00:04:14.980> with<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.310> wood<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:16.030> can

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
each other crossed with a wood I can

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.539 
each other crossed with a wood I can
lock<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.810> table<00:04:17.139> movement<00:04:17.829> out<00:04:17.980> front<00:04:18.400> to

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
lock the table movement out front to

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.000 
lock the table movement out front to
back<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.870> do<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.169> we<00:04:20.350> just<00:04:20.380> move<00:04:20.829> to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
back and to do that we just move to

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.860 
back and to do that we just move to
front<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.370> back<00:04:21.579> stops<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.389> they<00:04:22.540> butt<00:04:22.750> up

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
front to back stops so they butt up

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.710 
front to back stops so they butt up
against<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.440> pin<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.889> lock<00:04:24.070> them<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.400> place

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
against the pin and lock them in place

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.450 
against the pin and lock them in place
now<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:25.750> can<00:04:26.020> adjust<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.530> left<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.889> right<00:04:27.040> stops

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
now I can adjust the left to right stops

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.700 
now I can adjust the left to right stops
so<00:04:27.940> they<00:04:28.060> stop<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.570> reticule<00:04:28.960> over<00:04:29.410> each<00:04:29.530> of

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
so they stop the reticule over each of

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.250 
so they stop the reticule over each of
the<00:04:29.830> Tenon's<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:31.270> we<00:04:31.510> just<00:04:31.750> position<00:04:32.230> the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
the Tenon's then we just position the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.080 
the Tenon's then we just position the
cursor<00:04:32.500> over<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.130> 10<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.580> want<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.880> cut

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
cursor over the 10 and we want to cut

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.750 
cursor over the 10 and we want to cut
first<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.690> lock<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.410> table<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.830> place<00:04:36.100> and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
first and lock the table in place and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.909 
first and lock the table in place and
we're<00:04:36.910> ready<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.300> make<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.630> cut<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.680> first

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919

cut around the rest of the joint and

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.230 
cut around the rest of the joint and
then<00:05:17.860> we<00:05:17.979> can<00:05:18.130> go<00:05:18.280> ahead<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:18.520> route<00:05:18.789> away<00:05:18.970> the

to follow the template and now we have
two<00:05:23.860> perfectly<00:05:24.310> formed<00:05:24.760> Tenon's<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.240> we're

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
two perfectly formed Tenon's and we're

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.620 
two perfectly formed Tenon's and we're
ready<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.750> cut<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.050> mortises<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:28.120> first<00:05:28.390> step

when cutting mortises is to make a
series<00:05:30.580> of<00:05:30.610> plunge<00:05:31.030> cuts<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.660> remove<00:05:31.960> loss<00:05:32.200> in

series of plunge cuts to remove loss in
the<00:05:32.470> material<00:05:32.950> then<00:05:33.580> we'll<00:05:33.700> go<00:05:33.850> back<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.090> run

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
the material then we'll go back and run

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.090 
the material then we'll go back and run
the<00:05:34.479> router<00:05:34.780> through<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.380> mortise<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.950> make

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
the router through the mortise to make

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.060 
the router through the mortise to make
sure<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.430> sides<00:05:36.700> are<00:05:36.910> absolutely<00:05:37.419> clean<00:05:38.070> once

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
sure the sides are absolutely clean once

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.980 
sure the sides are absolutely clean once
again<00:05:39.340> we<00:05:39.490> move<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.880> table<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.479> cut<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.840> other

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
again we move the table to cut the other

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.100 
again we move the table to cut the other
mortise<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.740> then<00:05:41.979> lock<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.220> in<00:05:42.490> place<00:05:42.669> and

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
mortise and then lock it in place and

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.080 
mortise and then lock it in place and
then<00:05:44.110> we<00:05:44.289> repeat<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.830> procedure<00:05:45.000> making<00:05:46.000> a

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
then we repeat the procedure making a

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.790 
then we repeat the procedure making a
series<00:05:46.450> of<00:05:46.479> plunge<00:05:46.840> cuts<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.410> then<00:05:47.530> going

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
series of plunge cuts and then going

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.100 
series of plunge cuts and then going
back<00:05:48.010> and<00:05:48.220> cleaning<00:05:48.490> out<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.880> mortgage<00:05:49.210> this

back and cleaning out the mortgage this
is<00:05:50.320> actually<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.830> second<00:05:51.280> joint<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.669> made<00:05:51.880> the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
is actually the second joint I made the

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.150 
is actually the second joint I made the
first<00:05:52.419> one<00:05:52.600> was<00:05:52.750> too<00:05:52.960> tight<00:05:53.289> after<00:05:53.889> a<00:05:53.919> little

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
first one was too tight after a little

first one was too tight after a little
adjustment<00:05:54.580> with<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:54.910> pins<00:05:55.180> get<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:55.780> snap

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
adjustment with the pins get a snap
