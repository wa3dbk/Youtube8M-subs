and we're gonna start off with the L 90
here<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.170> highest<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
here not because it's the highest and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
here not because it's the highest and
it's<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> first<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.570> can

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it's because it's the first one we can

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's because it's the first one we can
get<00:00:27.779> our<00:00:27.930> hands<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:28.590> we'll<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:28.949> our

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
get our hands on and then we'll make our

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.060 
get our hands on and then we'll make our
way<00:00:29.160> through<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> rest<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> LG

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
way through the rest so this is the LG

way through the rest so this is the LG
l90<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:34.079> looks<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.250> lot

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
l90 and as you can see it looks a lot

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.229 
l90 and as you can see it looks a lot
and<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> feels<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.809> lot<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> g2<00:00:37.739> mini<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
and it feels a lot like the g2 mini and

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.639 
and it feels a lot like the g2 mini and
