00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.999
 so Yana Khokhlova and Sergey Novitsky 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.109
 and we stand 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.929
 flamenco music 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.159
 sick fomenko and more rum 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.730
 and thirteenth place among them 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.730
 exactly after the original dance 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.029
 I want to remind that they are debutants 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.980
 olympic games 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.800
 she is 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.270
 in european championship 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.700
 Europe 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.080
 which was 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 he doesn't have 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.319
 but when precipitating saki and 6 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.469
 no one in the presence 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.229
 20 Platon sports loved heat 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.309
 met 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.979
 Tarkhov new Novitsky here on my 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.249
 look at the track 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.539
 performance 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.449
 English duets guys was 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.949
 several him so 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.249
 percentage is hard to perform because 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:01.120
 all the same 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.930
 such tricks 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.860
 n Englishwoman rossel yes and in my opinion 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.349
 so seismic against them 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.349
 acts as an English duet 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.569
 such music which and his son 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.569
 calculation to increase to increase its assessment 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.770
 I don't know it seems to me that they probably already 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.979
 coped 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:24.990
 cycle 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.199
 tasks 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.059
 and here we will show how much 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:32.300
 three points of our fans 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.800
 I already talked about those unacceptable 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.560
 individual techniques american 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.430
 and Canadian figure skater want to 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.500
 note and technique of our n athletes 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.020
 which 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.020
 very good at skating 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.639
 owns well what time 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.020
 here is the second firm of this music new right 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.110
 absolute volume that of course music 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.650
 will also be a region difficult for 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.790
 total rich no to 4 minutes for 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.349
 create some kind of image 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.349
 dancing it's not necessary to possess of course 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.569
 definitely skill were 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.599
 interesting finds in their produce 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.889
 or are you in arbitrary 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.889
 poet compositions were 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.639
 there were no such clear strudel violation 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.050
 patent year 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.069
 which rules 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.189
 we spoke at the very beginning 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.169
 t reportings emotionally girl 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.879
 very emotional so powerful 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.460
 partners 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.979
 m 100 km 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.839
 m makes a fuss here support transportation 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.180
 do only our skaters well well 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.449
 Let us argue how judges will judge their speeches. 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.460
 especially since they had the thirteenth 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.779
 place on c3 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.129
 original 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.169
 dance well such findings about which 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.879
 they said just 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.300
 and encouraged 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.400
 kinds of rule even written down here that 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.979
 such original find they will 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:04.169
 getting strong 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.759
 budget extra 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.759
 bonuses 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.639
 and the trainer is warming Alexander 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.349
 with the population 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.349
 who are preparing this duet 

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:22.239
 when the wind passes to our parents 

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:25.239
 skaters with him 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:30.139
 respectively 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.139
 very appreciated 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.129
 smart dance happened in the evening the court ordered 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:39.369
 This is the second result and will not show 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:41.550
 the queen is her only 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.149
 Italians 

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:45.509
 Englishmen bypasses earlier 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.479
 but true on the amount 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.659
 capable not only 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.659
 for centuries 

00:07:56.849 --> 00:07:57.580
 we tend
