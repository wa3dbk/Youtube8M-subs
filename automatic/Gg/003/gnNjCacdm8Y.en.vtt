sugar<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:39.370> you<00:01:40.370> what<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.580> had<00:01:40.880> according<00:01:41.570> to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
sugar to it you what I had according to

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.750 
sugar to it you what I had according to
against<00:01:42.110> this<00:01:42.860> much<00:01:43.040> will<00:01:43.190> be<00:01:43.220> fine<00:01:43.520> we're

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
against this much will be fine we're

00:01:43.760 --> 00:02:02.060 
against this much will be fine we're
going<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.120> puree<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.660> until<00:01:44.840> it's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.950 

so<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.100> typed<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.670> little<00:02:04.000> hard<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.479> blend<00:02:04.689> it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
so I typed it little hard to blend it

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.890 
so I typed it little hard to blend it
you<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.320> add<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.470> bit<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.740> milk<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:07.720> will

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
you can add a bit of milk to it it will

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:30.339 
you can add a bit of milk to it it will
help<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.350> learning<00:02:08.830> these

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.979 

so<00:02:31.349> it's<00:02:31.700> hard<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> blend<00:02:33.569> it

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
so it's hard to blend it

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.009 
so it's hard to blend it
they<00:02:34.170> won't<00:02:34.349> watch<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:35.099> off<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.659> it

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.630 

and<00:02:40.019> make<00:02:40.379> sure<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:40.620> provide<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.069> very<00:02:41.310> fine

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and make sure you provide a very fine

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.630 
and make sure you provide a very fine
based<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.329> these<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.099> I'll<00:02:44.099> add<00:02:44.310> some<00:02:44.519> more

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
based on these and I'll add some more

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.369 
based on these and I'll add some more
yogurt<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.480> thought<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.260> less<00:02:48.379> great

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
yogurt to it I thought it was less great

00:02:49.379 --> 00:03:21.330 
yogurt to it I thought it was less great
for<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:50.250> dilutes<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.879> is

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.979 

the<00:03:22.340> mixture<00:03:22.700> is<00:03:22.730> somewhat<00:03:23.239> smooth<00:03:23.569> now

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.780 

that's<00:03:26.989> my<00:03:27.260> slipper<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:30.010> rest<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.280> milk

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.170 

and<00:03:34.790> then<00:03:35.090> churn<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:36.970> India<00:03:37.970> would<00:03:38.090> you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
and then churn it India would you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.930 
and then churn it India would you
