his tether almost where it seemed like
this<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.160> guy<00:04:12.370> who<00:04:12.400> looks<00:04:12.730> like<00:04:12.820> he<00:04:13.060> could

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
this is a guy who looks like he could

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.030 
this is a guy who looks like he could
end<00:04:13.420> up<00:04:13.600> now<00:04:13.930> hanging<00:04:14.350> up<00:04:14.440> his<00:04:14.560> mouse<00:04:14.799> and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
end up now hanging up his mouse and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.500 
end up now hanging up his mouse and
keyboard<00:04:15.190> at<00:04:15.579> any<00:04:15.730> point<00:04:15.970> because<00:04:16.269> he<00:04:16.390> was

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
keyboard at any point because he was

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.270 
keyboard at any point because he was
just<00:04:16.720> not<00:04:16.900> seemingly<00:04:17.350> having<00:04:17.769> fun<00:04:18.070> with<00:04:18.250> the

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
just not seemingly having fun with the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.969 
just not seemingly having fun with the
game<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.729> think<00:04:19.329> this<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:20.380> fact<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.680> he<00:04:20.769> can

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
game I think this the fact that he can

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.040 
game I think this the fact that he can
play<00:04:21.130> ap<00:04:21.640> champions<00:04:22.120> top<00:04:22.330> lane<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.720> play

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
play ap champions top lane and play

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.630 
play ap champions top lane and play

without teleport here today which is
something<00:04:24.849> was<00:04:25.120> quite<00:04:25.390> vocal<00:04:25.750> about<00:04:25.780> that's

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
something was quite vocal about that's

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.330

love<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> analogy<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.080> hanging<00:04:32.380> up<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.560> mouse

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
and keyboard though i do think it's a

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.820 
and keyboard though i do think it's a
bit<00:04:33.940> weird<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.720> do<00:04:34.840> say<00:04:35.290> boots<00:04:35.560> what<00:04:35.800> I

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
bit weird you do say boots what I

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.080 
bit weird you do say boots what I
realized<00:04:36.220> doesn't<00:04:36.729> really<00:04:36.880> make<00:04:37.030> sense

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
realized doesn't really make sense

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.909 
realized doesn't really make sense
that's<00:04:37.389> taking<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.720> depressing<00:04:38.229> turn<00:04:38.470> all

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
that's taking a depressing turn all
