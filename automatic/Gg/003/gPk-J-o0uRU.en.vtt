00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
people now a sort of question in it but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.960 
people now a sort of question in it but
it<00:02:27.680> has<00:02:27.800> been<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> sport<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.520> long<00:02:28.670> time<00:02:28.940> and

I think it's a solid product beta

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.570 
I think it's a solid product beta
alanine<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.140> real<00:02:33.380> up<00:02:33.530> comer<00:02:33.740> it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
alanine and that is a real up comer it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.220 
alanine and that is a real up comer it
does<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.120> really<00:02:35.540> strong<00:02:35.750> effects<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.320> me<00:02:36.470> um
