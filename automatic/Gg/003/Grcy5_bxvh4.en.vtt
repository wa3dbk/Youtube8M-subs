00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
aside for several months but studied it

be a lunar version of this and if you

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.240 
be a lunar version of this and if you
look<00:04:44.930> closely<00:04:45.200> you'll<00:04:45.620> see<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:46.070> there<00:04:46.220> are
