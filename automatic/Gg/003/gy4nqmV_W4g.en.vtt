00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.520
 the perception of the environment and through the identification of 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.130
 chemistry is primitive and universal in almost all animal cement 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.309
 sensory senses kim and sky receivers 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.820
 spreads in the dark contaminated waste 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.710
 stable and durable 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.539
 we reached stocks 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.239
 the disadvantages slow spread did not quickly undo high cost 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.880
 energy for production 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.300
 from the simplest organisms to the most complex we find senses 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.330
 kimmel receivers 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.300
 the households posture have mechanisms of orientation in the river are structures 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 subsection to detect chemical residues 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.840
 the vast majority of invertebrates have cells with functions the festival if they like 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 associated with haiti kelly 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.990
 or whether it is a matter of day-to-day optional situations 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.990
 by which a group of sensory cells 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.150
 every sensory cell the long digital process master would end up 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
 here opens up to the external environment 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 in insects these hairs cover the whole body 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.119
 at the tip of his proposal of a fly we find the candles 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.509
 assets with allies shrank at the outset with the market the sectors and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.440
 too much to taste 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.790
 each with specific sensitivities 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.870
 to sugar 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.970
 salt water 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.450
 or to various other compounds 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.590
 but by sensory detection of plant-breeding pheromones 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.540
 in the terrestrial inserts the sensorial and quantitative receivers the question 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.930
 also located in champions 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.110
 which can capture substances with long distances 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.460
 in some species in this sense is very sharp 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.000
 the scenes of a certain species of butterfly eg feline secret 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.050
 Alfaguara negotiation of the event he wanted a chemical line 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.379
 so we but the carriers to analyze only with thousands of receivers 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.629
 sensory detection of any misano air track the more it detects the 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.329
 presence of pheromone 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.049
 to the balance or contraventor zigzagging and towards the avenue 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.209
 in the breakdown of recipient procedures are quite different 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:42.829
 vertebrate sensory cells have on long eyelashes that 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.359
 increases the adhesion surface of substances to the transit membrane dora 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:54.889
 the taste buds sensory cells are generally located 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.719
 in the natural cavities 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.499
 but there are aquatic animals such as catfish eg button dropping 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.729
 taste located outside the mouth throughout the body 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.759
 they should also increase the adhesion surface using the niqab and 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:10.189
