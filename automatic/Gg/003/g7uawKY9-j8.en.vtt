 i will show you my purchases my office 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 Cooney faith and no matter what the video 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.500
 called back to school 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.619
 I think almost no difference at all 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.990
 There will be 2 vidos on the subject of school over the second 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.080
 video I have already started working for me personally 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.300
 she really likes this video but usually 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.279
 it's just i'll show you my pi over 2 and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.410
 so if you are interested it please 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.140
 stay with me if not then just 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.360
 wait for the next video so guys 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.399
 let's start with notebooks with 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.309
 every year every year 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.649
 thicker and thicker want to show you the most 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.809
 my favorite notebooks 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 really got for a class agency but I don't 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.539
 endured the rest and probably all of you 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.460
 brought this notebook in a strange language i 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.050
 a fan of simple covers but at the same 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.969
 time for them to be special 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.340
 any beautiful wanna talk 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.750
 about notebooks that went around the module 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.270
 somewhere about four years ago 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.180
 these are osmotic notebooks that is, and not with 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.330
 inscriptions history close so on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.979
 these strands are really very me 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.409
 I rarely liked them very rarely 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.270
 used in school because like 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.490
 rule they are pretty simple you 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.610
 snow is nothing unusual the delight of these 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.680
 notebooks in the fact that they are with the rules 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 there are back or ahead can be 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 rules you can't always remember 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.450
 exactly let's say in indian it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 irregular verbs sequence of tenses 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.829
 yes anything further my find was 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.720
 notebooks that are very cool 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.020
 that feeling when the notebooks 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.750
 36 sheets they are essentially me 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.090
 need but pass by them for some reason I donâ€™t 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.729
 was able this year I discovered 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.539
 notebooks that hold themselves for three 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.670
 the subject 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.420
 after the test is not really like 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.869
 notebook and when I saw that they 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.549
 rg in which the subject simply not 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.539
 delimited by such 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.569
 1 item blue 2 green and 3 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.890
 red yes it is very comfortable and that 3 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.019
 the subject in one notebook 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.019
 I would not risk using such 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.700
 school notebooks because i think that 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.310
 teachers would be against 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.510
 so that in the notebook and the subject was still 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.989
 some item 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.269
 but sometimes at school I resorted to the fact that 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.829
 I had to look for design in 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.310
 Internet suitable for me 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.099
 print it out and make a new cover 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.410
 for a notebook, I did it out of it I do not understand 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.810
 sometimes I could not find a nickname that would be me 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.180
 Liked and so I took let's say 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.010
 he himself died a mortal who found but in 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.950
 for a year and and every week or 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.230
 Every month a new cover was added 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.639
 searched for special templates on the Internet 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.790
 by the way now there is even a group 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.799
 special in which there are such here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.319
 you know there are people who take for 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.209
 yourself at school when specifically resolving 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.109
 for strong so you can wear in 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:03.079
 school only one tablet that is there in 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.019
 get and all textbooks and all notebooks 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.690
 yes of course it is convenient very comfortable I even 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.150
 no doubt because threw one 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.250
 tablet bag and went to school 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.620
 oh my god i am very used to writing in 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 notebooks pen and she is not a supporter to read 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.430
 books in electronic form and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.910
 I guess I wouldn't have this 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.799
 do 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.670
 i confess to school i am very rare 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.780
 on the hayloft in the textbook if 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.730
 and wore 2 tutorials a day we 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.080
 agreed with my girlfriend we are with her 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.599
 Is it at one desk so in the game 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.130
 carrier one textbook for two for me 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.800
 it would really be very convenient 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.780
 but I'm not used to it and I don't know how 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.790
 would i be able to dictate to 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.920
 tablet write your opinion about it 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.530
 what do you think would become 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.230
 so go high school high school already 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.450
 Of course, colored markers are not needed. 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.319
 paint pencils and so on but everything 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.709
 more becomes a drawing paper and a4 and 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.650
 folder files all sorts I even without talking 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.069
 always in August, bought myself such 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.080
 grandmother I could not even think about what 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.060
 maybe I wo n't need them 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.630
 this year is not because even if 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.350
 the teacher does not require all the rules to collect 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.239
 It is in these folders that I will tell you this 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.950
 very convenient because we allow 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.380
 teacher you him and 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.690
 it is very convenient because let's say 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.010
 I have a folder 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:32.039
 English I have all the rules all 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.560
 the rules are simple and i just if i need 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.130
 rule i will take open this this rule 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.720
 and 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.270
 the earth then i'm here adores one drawing 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.110
 Here is the picture even decided to print myself 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.560

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.980
 abstracts on 50 pages and so I even 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.670

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.330
 a lot of A4 sheets the thing is i 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.480
