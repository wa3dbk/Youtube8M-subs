at<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> same<00:01:21.900> time<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.890> gameplay

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
at the same time and that the gameplay

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070 
at the same time and that the gameplay
just<00:01:23.430> feels<00:01:23.640> better<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.030> general<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.780> upload

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080

just feels better in general to upload
and<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:26.479> don't<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.720> speeding<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and I don't like speeding up the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.649 
and I don't like speeding up the
choppers<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.119> seems<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
choppers because it just seems like a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.719 
choppers because it just seems like a
waste<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.110> time<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.380> commentating<00:01:32.340> over<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
waste of time and commentating over and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
waste of time and commentating over and
just<00:01:32.880> doesn't<00:01:33.030> feel<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.540> you'll<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.409> most

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
just doesn't feel good you'll see most
