it's not super thick like the only thing
I<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.140> that's<00:03:32.260> really<00:03:32.650> super<00:03:32.800> thick

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
I can think of that's really super thick

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.190 
I can think of that's really super thick
is<00:03:33.280> if<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.640> have<00:03:34.180> sambuca<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> freezer

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
is if you have sambuca in the freezer

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.990 
is if you have sambuca in the freezer
for<00:03:35.440> an<00:03:35.560> hour<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.920> then<00:03:35.980> pour<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.520> that's

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
for an hour and then pour it that's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.210 
for an hour and then pour it that's
that's<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.840> highest<00:03:38.230> degree<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.739> then

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that's the highest degree and then

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.000 
that's the highest degree and then
there's<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:40.209> super<00:03:40.870> thin<00:03:41.080> water<00:03:41.320> cheap<00:03:41.739> rum

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
there's like super thin water cheap rum

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.370 
there's like super thin water cheap rum
or<00:03:42.280> vodka<00:03:42.570> then<00:03:43.570> there's<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.930> right<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.320> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
or vodka then there's this right in the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.699 
or vodka then there's this right in the
middle<00:03:47.520> now<00:03:48.989> while<00:03:49.989> it's<00:03:50.110> got<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.320> flavor

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
middle now while it's got that flavor

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.010 
middle now while it's got that flavor
the<00:03:51.250> aroma<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.120> also<00:03:52.480> comes<00:03:52.690> out<00:03:52.840> in

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
the aroma that you get also comes out in

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.040 
the aroma that you get also comes out in
the<00:03:53.140> finish<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.360> think<00:03:55.600> what's<00:03:55.750> happening

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the finish and I think what's happening

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.600 
the finish and I think what's happening
is<00:03:56.170> as<00:03:56.290> you're<00:03:56.440> sipping<00:03:56.800> in<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.070> aroma<00:03:57.310> goes

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
is as you're sipping in that aroma goes

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.160 
is as you're sipping in that aroma goes
through<00:03:58.030> your<00:03:58.150> nasal<00:03:58.300> passages<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:59.050> you're

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
through your nasal passages so you're

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.560 
through your nasal passages so you're
getting<00:03:59.440> almost<00:04:00.220> like<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.730> nice<00:04:01.030> floral

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
getting almost like that nice floral

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.360 
getting almost like that nice floral
flavor<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.530> little<00:04:02.770> bit<00:04:02.860> of<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.040> vanilla

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
flavor and a little bit of the vanilla

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.500 
flavor and a little bit of the vanilla
and<00:04:04.020> sweetness<00:04:05.020> which<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.770> kind<00:04:06.130> of

and sweetness which is kind of

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.610 
and sweetness which is kind of
distracting<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.630> from<00:04:07.660> any<00:04:07.959> type<00:04:08.200> of<00:04:08.230> weird

silky smooth texture the quality is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.370 
silky smooth texture the quality is
there<00:04:17.370> when<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.400> sit<00:04:18.700> down<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.120> drink<00:04:19.330> it<00:04:19.570> while

No<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.360> think<00:04:24.569> it's<00:04:25.020> not<00:04:25.379> just<00:04:25.680> because<00:04:26.099> I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
No and I I think it's not just because I

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.399 
No and I I think it's not just because I
don't<00:04:26.699> normally<00:04:26.879> do<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.360> with<00:04:27.990> Rahm<00:04:28.229> in

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
don't normally do that with Rahm in

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.290 
don't normally do that with Rahm in
general<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.159> I<00:04:29.370> would<00:04:29.520> rather<00:04:29.669> have<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:30.240> a

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
general but I would rather have like a

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.850 
general but I would rather have like a
bourbon<00:04:30.659> or<00:04:30.780> something<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.169> has<00:04:31.349> a<00:04:31.379> huge

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
bourbon or something that has a huge

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.129 
bourbon or something that has a huge
intense<00:04:32.280> impact<00:04:32.729> on<00:04:33.090> my<00:04:33.300> palate<00:04:33.629> well<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.960> is

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
intense impact on my palate well this is

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.309 
intense impact on my palate well this is
elegance<00:04:35.039> I<00:04:35.509> wouldn't<00:04:36.509> say<00:04:36.629> it's<00:04:36.750> exciting

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
elegance I wouldn't say it's exciting

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.070 
elegance I wouldn't say it's exciting
right<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.340> that's<00:04:39.000> fine<00:04:39.240> because<00:04:39.629> when<00:04:39.990> you

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
right and that's fine because when you

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.580 
right and that's fine because when you
put<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:40.409> into<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:41.210> rum<00:04:42.210> based<00:04:42.479> drink<00:04:42.870> let's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
put this into a rum based drink let's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.020 
put this into a rum based drink let's
say<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.710> drink<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.159> has<00:04:44.250> two<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.669> three<00:04:44.879> ounces

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
say a drink that has two to three ounces

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.469 
say a drink that has two to three ounces
of<00:04:45.389> white<00:04:45.599> rum<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:47.310> floral<00:04:47.909> impact<00:04:48.300> and

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
of white rum in it the floral impact and

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.809 
of white rum in it the floral impact and
some<00:04:48.599> of<00:04:48.690> those<00:04:48.780> vanilla<00:04:49.620> flavors<00:04:50.220> are<00:04:50.669> gonna

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
some of those vanilla flavors are gonna

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.360 
some of those vanilla flavors are gonna
come<00:04:51.090> through<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.330> lot<00:04:51.569> better<00:04:51.870> than<00:04:52.860> using<00:04:53.280> a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
come through a lot better than using a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.939 
come through a lot better than using a
very<00:04:54.469> clean<00:04:56.599> flavorless<00:04:57.599> rum<00:04:58.229> which<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.770> me

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
very clean flavorless rum which to me

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.170 
very clean flavorless rum which to me
would<00:04:59.759> be<00:04:59.969> more<00:05:00.270> like<00:05:00.509> say<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:01.110> vodka<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.889> if<00:05:02.789> I

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
would be more like say a vodka and if I

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.520 
would be more like say a vodka and if I
wanted<00:05:03.629> a<00:05:03.840> clean<00:05:04.199> crisp<00:05:05.240> flavorless<00:05:06.530> neutral

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
wanted a clean crisp flavorless neutral

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.930 
wanted a clean crisp flavorless neutral
based<00:05:07.680> spirit<00:05:08.099> I<00:05:08.219> would<00:05:08.430> probably<00:05:08.580> go<00:05:08.789> with<00:05:08.849> a

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
based spirit I would probably go with a

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.480 
based spirit I would probably go with a
high-end<00:05:09.180> vodka<00:05:09.810> as<00:05:10.139> opposed<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.710> anything

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
high-end vodka as opposed to anything

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.839 
high-end vodka as opposed to anything
else<00:05:11.639> so<00:05:12.560> it's<00:05:13.560> got<00:05:13.800> its<00:05:13.830> nice<00:05:14.190> flavors<00:05:14.699> that

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
else so it's got its nice flavors that

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.550 
else so it's got its nice flavors that
define<00:05:15.210> itself<00:05:15.629> and<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.080> think<00:05:16.259> that's<00:05:16.440> the

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
define itself and I think that's the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.719 
define itself and I think that's the
important<00:05:16.949> thing<00:05:17.039> is<00:05:17.159> it's<00:05:17.280> it's<00:05:17.520> definitely

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
important thing is it's it's definitely

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.430 
important thing is it's it's definitely
defined<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.479> pour<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.080> will<00:05:19.229> know

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
defined you pour it you will know

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.740 
defined you pour it you will know
there's<00:05:19.889> no<00:05:20.190> doubt<00:05:20.460> in<00:05:20.669> my<00:05:20.699> mind<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.419> see<00:05:21.449> with

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
there's no doubt in my mind you see with

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.020 
there's no doubt in my mind you see with
the<00:05:21.810> MS<00:05:21.990> vicinity<00:05:22.560> you're<00:05:23.129> gonna<00:05:23.310> get<00:05:23.550> the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
the MS vicinity you're gonna get the

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.110 
the MS vicinity you're gonna get the
impact<00:05:24.449> which<00:05:25.319> I<00:05:25.469> kind<00:05:25.710> of<00:05:25.740> like<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:26.639> question
