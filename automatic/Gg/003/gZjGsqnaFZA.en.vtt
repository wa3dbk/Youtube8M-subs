00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
job yes don't actually do anything stare

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.139 
job yes don't actually do anything stare
stare<00:00:44.660> we're<00:00:45.649> sparring<00:00:45.890> for<00:00:46.100> sparging<00:00:46.789> we

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
stare we're sparring for sparging we

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.360 
stare we're sparring for sparging we
can't<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:47.989> can't<00:00:48.019> stare<00:00:48.589> Jameel<00:00:49.010> still<00:00:49.219> had<00:00:49.339> a

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
can't you can't stare Jameel still had a

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:58.190 
can't you can't stare Jameel still had a
staring<00:00:49.850> dude<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.690> need<00:00:50.839> two<00:00:51.050> pumps

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.950 

so<00:00:59.200> we're<00:00:59.410> alternating

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so we're alternating

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.260 
so we're alternating
essentially<00:01:01.500> doing<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:03.409> hybrid<00:01:04.409> batch

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
essentially doing like a hybrid batch

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.640 
essentially doing like a hybrid batch
continuous<00:01:06.270> spark<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> we're

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
continuous spark right now so we're

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.149 
continuous spark right now so we're
building<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:09.150> foot<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.619> water<00:01:10.860> on

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
building up a foot or two of water on

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.680 
building up a foot or two of water on
top<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> grain<00:01:11.820> bed<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> we're<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
top of the grain bed and we're going to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.570 
top of the grain bed and we're going to
just<00:01:12.869> let<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.260> run<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:13.710> until<00:01:14.190> it's<00:01:14.340> close

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
just let that run down until it's close

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.370 
just let that run down until it's close
to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> bumped<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> grain<00:01:15.960> bill<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to the bumped off the grain bill and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
to the bumped off the grain bill and
then<00:01:16.470> put<00:01:16.680> some<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.280> water<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
then put some more of our water on and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.840 
then put some more of our water on and
just<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:20.369> account<00:01:20.759> for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just all take that back to account for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.880 
just all take that back to account for
the<00:01:21.000> fact<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.540> only<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.869> one

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.120 

I'm<00:01:28.550> excited<00:01:29.330> I'm<00:01:29.780> nervous<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.620> this<00:01:30.890> thing

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
I'm excited I'm nervous that this thing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.130 
I'm excited I'm nervous that this thing
isn't<00:01:31.280> gonna<00:01:31.520> run<00:01:31.760> off<00:01:31.910> very<00:01:32.150> well<00:01:32.390> why<00:01:32.930> has

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
isn't gonna run off very well why has

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.290 
isn't gonna run off very well why has
they<00:01:33.230> had<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.410> problem<00:01:34.160> yesterday<00:01:34.370> in<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
they had a problem yesterday in the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.140 
they had a problem yesterday in the
mills<00:01:35.480> been<00:01:35.660> real<00:01:35.840> Krissy<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.310> we're<00:01:38.000> not<00:01:38.090> sure

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
mills been real Krissy so we're not sure

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.110 
mills been real Krissy so we're not sure
how<00:01:38.570> good<00:01:38.900> our<00:01:38.960> crush<00:01:39.350> was<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.820> didn't<00:01:41.060> pick

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
how good our crush was we didn't pick

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.760 
how good our crush was we didn't pick
the<00:01:41.270> problem<00:01:41.630> with<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.900> race<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.560> rigs

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
the problem with the race the rigs

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.650 
the problem with the race the rigs
weren't<00:01:43.100> aligned<00:01:43.430> properly<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:44.330> hopefully

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
weren't aligned properly so hopefully

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.760 
weren't aligned properly so hopefully
that<00:01:44.840> will<00:01:44.960> help<00:01:45.130> but<00:01:47.290> they're<00:01:48.290> they're<00:01:48.590> run

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
that will help but they're they're run

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.560 
that will help but they're they're run
off<00:01:48.890> yesterday<00:01:49.310> with<00:01:49.340> our

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
off yesterday with our

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.420 
off yesterday with our
so<00:01:51.260> we're<00:01:51.410> hoping<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:51.710> doesn't<00:01:52.190> repeat

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
so we're hoping that doesn't repeat

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.540 
so we're hoping that doesn't repeat
itself<00:01:53.890> we've<00:01:54.890> got<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.040> real<00:01:55.220> late<00:01:55.400> start<00:01:55.730> today

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
itself we've got a real late start today

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.710 
itself we've got a real late start today
figure<00:01:58.550> out<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.850> rulers<00:01:59.180> getting<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.510> late

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
figure out the rulers getting a late

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.190 
figure out the rulers getting a late
start

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
start

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.560
