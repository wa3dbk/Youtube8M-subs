Christine as I talk were obviously can
have<00:00:07.300> a<00:00:07.359> look<00:00:07.479> at<00:00:07.540> the<00:00:07.630> images<00:00:07.930> but<00:00:08.139> tell<00:00:08.320> us

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
have a look at the images but tell us

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.860 
have a look at the images but tell us
where<00:00:08.920> it's<00:00:09.129> happening<00:00:09.490> and<00:00:09.610> you<00:00:10.360> know<00:00:10.480> what

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
where it's happening and you know what

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.180 
where it's happening and you know what
are<00:00:11.020> they<00:00:11.080> saying<00:00:11.290> about<00:00:11.469> the<00:00:11.680> extent<00:00:11.950> of<00:00:12.070> it

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
are they saying about the extent of it

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.039 
are they saying about the extent of it
sure<00:00:12.610> is<00:00:12.760> happening<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.180> region<00:00:13.539> called<00:00:13.750> to

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
sure is happening the region called to

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.410 
sure is happening the region called to
have<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.440> Antarctic<00:00:15.129> Peninsula<00:00:15.309> and<00:00:16.299> I've

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
have the Antarctic Peninsula and I've

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.090 
have the Antarctic Peninsula and I've
been<00:00:16.600> there<00:00:16.840> it's<00:00:17.020> known<00:00:17.199> as<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.350> banana<00:00:17.800> belt

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
been there it's known as the banana belt

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.970 
been there it's known as the banana belt
because<00:00:18.520> although<00:00:19.060> it's<00:00:19.270> freezing<00:00:19.869> by<00:00:20.080> normal

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
because although it's freezing by normal

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.920 
because although it's freezing by normal
standards<00:00:21.100> it<00:00:21.610> is<00:00:21.640> actually<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.150> warmest<00:00:22.690> bit

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
standards it is actually the warmest bit

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.600 
standards it is actually the warmest bit
of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.200> Antarctic<00:00:23.530> and<00:00:23.950> it's<00:00:24.070> warming<00:00:24.490> up

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
of the Antarctic and it's warming up

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.520 
of the Antarctic and it's warming up
faster<00:00:25.510> than<00:00:25.539> anywhere<00:00:26.050> else<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:26.470> the

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
faster than anywhere else in the

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.650 
faster than anywhere else in the
southern<00:00:26.920> hemisphere<00:00:26.950> by<00:00:27.730> by<00:00:27.910> point<00:00:28.270> five

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
southern hemisphere by by point five

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.740 
southern hemisphere by by point five
degrees<00:00:29.110> every<00:00:29.710> decade<00:00:30.190> so<00:00:30.490> this<00:00:30.670> area<00:00:30.910> they

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
degrees every decade so this area they

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.200 
degrees every decade so this area they
think<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.230> really<00:00:32.710> been<00:00:32.890> hit<00:00:33.160> hard<00:00:33.430> by<00:00:33.699> global

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
think is really been hit hard by global

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.510 
think is really been hit hard by global
warming<00:00:34.600> I<00:00:34.870> mean<00:00:35.260> you<00:00:35.559> know<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:35.770> images<00:00:36.370> speak

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
warming I mean you know the images speak

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.889 
warming I mean you know the images speak
for<00:00:36.699> themselves<00:00:37.030> really<00:00:37.300> when<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:37.600> see<00:00:37.780> the

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
for themselves really when you see the

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.899 
for themselves really when you see the
extent<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.379> that<00:00:38.589> and<00:00:38.859> yet<00:00:39.039> you<00:00:39.519> know<00:00:39.609> we<00:00:39.789> are

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
extent of that and yet you know we are

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.209 
extent of that and yet you know we are
regularly<00:00:40.480> reporting<00:00:41.109> on<00:00:41.260> ice<00:00:41.409> melting<00:00:42.010> and

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
regularly reporting on ice melting and

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.399 
regularly reporting on ice melting and
you<00:00:42.819> know<00:00:42.909> climate<00:00:43.359> change<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.870> does<00:00:44.140> this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
you know climate change it does this

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.009 
you know climate change it does this
what<00:00:44.979> we're<00:00:45.159> seeing<00:00:45.339> now<00:00:45.460> represent<00:00:46.179> a<00:00:46.390> step

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
what we're seeing now represent a step

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.509 
what we're seeing now represent a step
change<00:00:47.050> in<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.679> kind<00:00:47.859> of<00:00:47.949> debate<00:00:48.190> we've<00:00:48.370> had

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
change in the kind of debate we've had

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.329 
change in the kind of debate we've had
or<00:00:48.670> not<00:00:48.819> well<00:00:49.179> as<00:00:49.329> part<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.929> trend<00:00:50.739> over<00:00:51.159> the

or not well as part of a trend over the

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.119 
or not well as part of a trend over the
last<00:00:51.460> few<00:00:51.999> decades<00:00:52.239> this<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.289> about<00:00:53.559> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
last few decades this is about the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.039 
last few decades this is about the
seventh<00:00:54.609> ice<00:00:54.789> shelf<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.539> it's<00:00:55.659> the<00:00:55.749> biggest

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
seventh ice shelf and it's the biggest

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.129 
seventh ice shelf and it's the biggest
one<00:00:56.260> it's<00:00:56.440> about<00:00:56.879> 5,000<00:00:57.879> square<00:00:58.179> miles<00:00:58.719> in

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
one it's about 5,000 square miles in

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.049 
one it's about 5,000 square miles in
total<00:00:59.350> the<00:01:00.010> whole<00:01:00.069> thing<00:01:00.339> hasn't<00:01:00.519> broken<00:01:00.819> up

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
total the whole thing hasn't broken up

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.270 
total the whole thing hasn't broken up
but<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:01.569> this<00:01:01.780> ice<00:01:01.960> shelf<00:01:02.319> does<00:01:02.799> break<00:01:03.069> up

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
but if this ice shelf does break up

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.330 
but if this ice shelf does break up
completely<00:01:03.729> it'll<00:01:04.449> be<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.690> biggest<00:01:04.870> to<00:01:05.740> go<00:01:05.979> on

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
completely it'll be the biggest to go on

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.950 
completely it'll be the biggest to go on
the<00:01:06.490> pictures<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.090> can<00:01:07.210> see<00:01:07.479> here<00:01:07.720> they're

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the pictures you can see here they're

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.749 
the pictures you can see here they're
flying<00:01:08.290> down<00:01:08.619> in<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.829> middle<00:01:09.039> of<00:01:09.189> this<00:01:09.340> crack

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
flying down in the middle of this crack

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.969 
flying down in the middle of this crack
the<00:01:10.390> whole<00:01:10.570> thing<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:11.020> broken<00:01:11.259> off<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.860> it's

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
the whole thing is broken off and it's

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.520 
the whole thing is broken off and it's
extraordinary<00:01:12.430> clean<00:01:13.420> break<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.200> width<00:01:14.409> of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
extraordinary clean break the width of

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.069 
extraordinary clean break the width of
that<00:01:14.649> were<00:01:15.009> looking<00:01:15.310> at<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.729> 200<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.329> 300<00:01:16.570> feet

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
that were looking at it 200 and 300 feet

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.160 
that were looking at it 200 and 300 feet
wide<00:01:17.259> those<00:01:17.680> cliffs<00:01:18.039> are<00:01:18.219> about<00:01:18.659> 60<00:01:19.659> foot<00:01:19.930> high

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
wide those cliffs are about 60 foot high

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.170 
wide those cliffs are about 60 foot high
I<00:01:20.469> mean<00:01:20.649> it's<00:01:20.740> an<00:01:20.829> amazing<00:01:21.430> sight<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.030> they're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
I mean it's an amazing sight and they're

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.929 
I mean it's an amazing sight and they're
watching<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.689> extremely<00:01:23.200> closely<00:01:23.619> they<00:01:24.609> went

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
watching it extremely closely they went

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.580 
watching it extremely closely they went
into<00:01:25.240> Luke<00:01:25.630> when<00:01:25.869> they<00:01:25.990> got<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> hint<00:01:26.439> from

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
into Luke when they got a hint from

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.080 
into Luke when they got a hint from
satellite<00:01:27.070> images<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.609> something<00:01:27.909> very

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
satellite images that something very

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.539 
satellite images that something very
strange<00:01:28.359> was<00:01:28.659> going<00:01:28.719> on<00:01:29.079> because<00:01:30.039> although

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
strange was going on because although

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.719 
strange was going on because although
this<00:01:31.329> eyes<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.899> on<00:01:32.170> water<00:01:32.530> if<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.189> melts<00:01:33.429> it

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
this eyes is on water if it melts it

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.880 
this eyes is on water if it melts it
won't<00:01:33.969> raise<00:01:34.270> sea<00:01:34.570> level<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.170> there's<00:01:35.679> no

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
won't raise sea level so there's no

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.550 
won't raise sea level so there's no
imminent<00:01:36.579> danger<00:01:37.149> anywhere<00:01:37.570> flooding<00:01:37.990> but

imminent danger anywhere flooding but

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.349 
imminent danger anywhere flooding but

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
when these break up and float away there

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.419
