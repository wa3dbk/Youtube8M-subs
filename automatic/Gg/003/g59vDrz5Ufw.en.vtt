00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.029
 and zionist apollo robbins decided to arrange 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 passers-by a few for difficult questions 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.699
 and you can also answer them directly 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.050
 from home the exact answer from you is not 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.850
 you only need to ask 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 limits in which you are sure 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.109

 you are asked how many continents on earth and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.260

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.700
 master you need to set limits in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.170
 which do you think 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 there is a correct answer for example from 4 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.980
 until 12 understandably okay ready first 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.630
 the subject 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.090
 I assure you it is not so easy 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.090
 this video how many books in the old testament 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.090
 remember you only need to ask 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.720
 the right limit so sure of your 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.320
 the answer and here we are sure that you 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.440
 you are mistaken how many books are in the old testament 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.210
 indicate the limit and as old testament as 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.110
 we assume foreman maximum 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.330
 how much can be 77 well a maximum 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.410
 how many can be 25 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.340
 what do you think determined the limits here 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.340
 you answer 39 is actually the old testament 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.260
 39 books but you only just 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.729
 it was necessary to define the necessary limits in 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.810
 which would enter the correct answer not 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:41.240
 just not so let's try again 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:47.960
 how many countries in africa how many countries in 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.610
 Africa 17 17 you absolute 30-30 good 0 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.570
 and maximum 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.250
 well 24 you are ready to answer sure that 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.250
 the correct answer is within your limits 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.850
 answer 57 countries well what is it this time 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.190
 better forgivable you again did not guess 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.620
 I'm just shocked and how is this attitude 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 the game has to arrogance you only 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.050
 think most likely you have no idea 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.580
 have had how many countries in africa 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.650
 then how can you limit 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.110
 number of options sets 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 limits again error almost all of ours 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.740
 participants installed surprisingly 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.860
 narrow limits although they did not know 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.930
 Answers Well, they did not understand you 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.900
 sure to know the exact answers to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.380
 issue length of mississippi in miles how are you 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.410
 think how much minimum in it and say 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.470
 began to understand a maximum of 3000 answer 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.970
 accepted congratulations you were right yes 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.950
 I now understand how it works 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.660
 the main thing is to install as much as possible and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 limits if the correct answers are not 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.650
 entered your limits means like 79 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.430
 percent of our members you 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.430
