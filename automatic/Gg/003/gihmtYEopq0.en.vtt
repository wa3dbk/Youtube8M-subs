00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hello today I would like to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.600
 share with you your opinion on 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.179
 professional hair care 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.179
 here metrics honestly i don't understand 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.980
 the difference when i use 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.540
 let's say luxury shampoo well or 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 principle well we will not burn luxury 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 so won those very good shampoo and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 professional shopper who me 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
 like a brush i don't feel the difference 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 Basically, there it smells clear business 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.910
 consistencies so on here but here at 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.489
 I had unsuccessful budget purchases 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 cosmetics for hair and therefore i 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.760
 a professional shop has come 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 asked for something to moisten me 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.079
 I needed from one company to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.110
 was and that was moistening for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.030
 the hair is very dry 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.180
 after winter, and in general, something like that is not very 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.700
 resilient here and I was offered in general 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.699
 firm we renounced the american firm 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.770
 super moisturizing shampoo and to it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.190
 balm conditioner in addition 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.059
 in shampoo i will have 300 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 milliliters and balm 250 milliliters but 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 it really is me 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 I worry all the time I want the opposite 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.610
 shampoo was 250 and balsam and 300 because 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.159
 that the balm often fails for some reason 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.009
 more and faster than shampoo in general so 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 what shampoo shampoo in so long 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.380
 cans by the way here these are packaged in appearance 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 they seem to have more volume than there is on 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.070
 really so shampoo does not smell I know 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 smells like citrus shampoo with something to me 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.049
 reminds shampoo fructis sat down someone 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 There from friends soap head should 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.229
 remind samsung fructis by smell 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.079
 balm the same about them 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.270
 same smells so shampoo has 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.450
 so white a little pearl so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 consistency color consistency gel 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.790
 but what I really liked about 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.619
 use that shampoo that balm 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.719
 very economical, that is what I usually 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.490
 I put that amount on my head 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.799
 in three it turned out more than you need here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.560
 this shampoo so the second third time 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.569
 when I used it I already 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.759
 strength is just two to three times less 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.880
 it was even more than adequate 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.250
 so here is super economical this one 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.760
 shampoo as for balsam balsam and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.910
 The consistency will be as dense as 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.180
 as if such a thick gel will now show 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.849
 rightly bring it like that 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.560
 some fruit Miguel probably grabbed 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.330
 here and when you carry it on 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.920
 voice seems to increase in 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.630
 volume cannot explain it not 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.910
 turns not into a booze of him that just 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.010
 as if it spreads through the hair very 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.799
 well increases in volume therefore 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.620
 that it is super economical that it is super 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.540
 economically so maybe this 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.319
 difference professional makeup can 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.690
 tell you that shampoo is very good 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.480
 he behaved first he is very good 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.130
 washed his hair was not required 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.530
 as if nothing but him 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.709
 washed and completely washed off the hair he 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.900
 it does it does not dry the hair but how would 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.269
 and I'm not sure I did n't notice much 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.370
 moistening that is thank god he doesn't 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.670
 dries and washes hair well 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.989
 a big plus but the hair is washed 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.070
 real squeaky but they are 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.200
 elastic stan 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.900
 remain it is just super honey it 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.109
 factor really like a balm I 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.880
 already said he applied he is so thick 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.340
 but very well distributed that is 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.230
 as if the hair is absorbed because 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.540
 when i wash away the feeling that i'm 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.150
 wash off three times less than I inflicted 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.160
 on the hair therefore it means there is part 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.769
 fed on the hair itself and somehow it is very 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.480
 pleases hair very cool 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.790
 comb even wet and sweat 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.670
 they immediately here it is not stated but 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.100
 does not give a very good volume i mean i 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.560
 I dried my hair with a hair dryer 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.900
 cheated nothing like volume did not 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.079
 and brand me straight in the morning finally the volume was 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.690
 But by the evening now it is already falling but 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.519
 hair looks exactly like 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.549
 they looked like i was just somehow 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.819
 I washed it with my shampoo 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.220
 such an advantage right now 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.959
 disgusting weather 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.790
 and now the wind is farther high humidity 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.730
 cool some more snow i was going without 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.060
 caps today -3 was and despite that 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.610
 high humidity in the wind and snow 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.920
 hairstyle as if she is more or less in 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.620
 decent form preserved this very 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.540
 cool just i think if it were 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.660
 ordinary shampoo is what I bought 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.550
 budget cosmetics everyone she is very 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.560
 cool so i hope he will 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.450
 behaving in good weather just 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.760
 fine now 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.060
 Of the minuses, I can not call it straight 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.000
 minus but then I read about him on 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.220
 all sorts otzovikah sites wrote 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.290
 that he puffs hair know my hair 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.970
 he doesnâ€™t push but she does as if 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.530
 thinner that is, they seem to be voluminous 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.450
 plump but as if they are looking 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.090
 middle wall soft soft know how 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.370
 childish hair, hair volume 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.380
 children are obtained but someone wrote that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.010
 he dries his hair but very well 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.000
 moisturizes 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.060
 it is a fact that even of the minuses of the minuses 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.550
 probably still what with the fact that they 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.810
 very economical and 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.419
 squeezed it a lot that is despite 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.150
 the fact that the neck here is this little 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.280
 narrow it squeezes so well 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.870
 so you need to coordinate all the time 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.500
 it is so mechanically so slightly 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.690
 was completely and shampoo and balm here in 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.940
 principle this is even niggle really 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.830
 because these funds I have are very 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.200
 they liked the American firm 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.260
 shampoo made in spain i balm 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.890
 by the way in america so in general it is 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.880
 thorough acquaintance with 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.440
 professional cosmetics me passed with 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.210
 success because before that I 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.400
 enjoyed with professional only 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.040
 the label is that the Japanese firm is very 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.820
 darling, so I do not formally carry it 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.530
 To cosmetics for such for salons'm 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.270
 Prostuck luxury cosmetics to those who 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.100
 nothing to do but it's disgusting 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.650
 funds for me were i was buying four 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.540
 thousands of different means paid for them 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.600
 ten then returned back to me 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.400
 why did you accept them and not say that 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.530
 thats where they flew 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.320
 hair just it was vile I was 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.840
 sorry as if even yes it was a pity for money 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.460
 but here it is like my first such 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.440
 acquaintance was me in principle 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.350
 I will like them with pleasure 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.690
 use but be sure to somewhere through 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.150
 two weeks I will buy another team 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.580
 means and I will alternate between two places 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.320
 I will use this two months 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.210
 I will use other means already 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.390
 I always do that to make my hair look like 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.680
 the head did not get used and that effect 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.720
 it remains that one 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.600
 as much as possible can be obtained from some 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.730
 use of what means are you like this 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.800
 was my review if you enjoyed 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.670
 by some 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.020
 professional tools write 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.520
 because I want to try 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.460
 some other professional tools 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.940
 but mostly for moisturizing for thin 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.580
 hair 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.070
 if there was such a write, I probably also 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.220
 some more then try the matrix to me 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.790
 like this thanks for the video well this 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.790
 next meeting
