wrote<00:00:14.459> an<00:00:14.609> article<00:00:14.760> for<00:00:15.150> energy<00:00:15.539> magazine<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
wrote an article for energy magazine and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
wrote an article for energy magazine and
he<00:00:16.470> came<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> idea<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> uncanny

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
he came up with the idea of the uncanny

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.019 
he came up with the idea of the uncanny
valley<00:00:18.560> he<00:00:19.560> made<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> observation<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.730> as

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
valley he made the observation that as

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.659 
valley he made the observation that as
you<00:00:21.179> make<00:00:21.359> robots<00:00:21.869> appear<00:00:22.470> more<00:00:23.160> human<00:00:23.220> like

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
you make robots appear more human like

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.269 
you make robots appear more human like
they<00:00:24.210> also<00:00:24.390> seem<00:00:24.839> more<00:00:25.019> familiar<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.769> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
they also seem more familiar and you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.579 
they also seem more familiar and you
would<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.329> the<00:00:27.839> extreme<00:00:28.320> they

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
would think that at the extreme they

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.109 
would think that at the extreme they
would<00:00:28.739> just<00:00:28.919> become<00:00:29.070> more<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.550> more<00:00:29.609> familiar

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
would just become more and more familiar

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
would just become more and more familiar
until<00:00:30.539> they're<00:00:30.659> as<00:00:30.749> familiar<00:00:30.989> as<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.349> healthy

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
until they're as familiar as a healthy

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.450 
until they're as familiar as a healthy
human<00:00:31.919> being<00:00:32.480> however<00:00:33.560> he<00:00:34.560> made<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> kind<00:00:35.310> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
human being however he made a kind of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
human being however he made a kind of
argument<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:37.290> robots<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.860> are

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
argument that actually robots that are

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.060 
argument that actually robots that are
almost<00:00:38.820> human<00:00:39.390> could<00:00:39.690> seem<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.230> strange<00:00:40.320> or

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
almost human could seem very strange or

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.490 
almost human could seem very strange or
eerie<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.790> he<00:00:42.390> called<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.900> uncanny

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
eerie and he called this the uncanny

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.490 
eerie and he called this the uncanny
valley<00:00:43.730> for<00:00:44.730> example<00:00:45.150> if<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.480> shook<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.260> hand

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
valley for example if you shook the hand

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.910 
valley for example if you shook the hand
of<00:00:46.620> someone<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.130> prosthetic<00:00:47.430> hand<00:00:48.030> then

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
of someone with a prosthetic hand then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
of someone with a prosthetic hand then
you<00:00:49.920> might<00:00:50.130> think<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> real<00:00:50.940> hand<00:00:51.270> but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you might think it's a real hand but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
you might think it's a real hand but
after<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.380> touch<00:00:52.650> it<00:00:52.830> it<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.070> feel<00:00:53.220> cold

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
after you touch it it would feel cold

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430 
after you touch it it would feel cold
and<00:00:53.820> it'd<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.090> lack<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.330> soft<00:00:54.780> tissue<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and it'd be a lack of soft tissue and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
and it'd be a lack of soft tissue and
then<00:00:55.890> you'd<00:00:56.070> find<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.490> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.640> very<00:00:56.760> strange<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
then you'd find it to be very strange so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.240 
then you'd find it to be very strange so
he<00:00:57.810> thought<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> build<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.770> human-like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
he thought that to build a human-like

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.100 
he thought that to build a human-like
robot<00:00:59.700> would<00:00:59.880> be<00:01:00.060> like<00:01:00.240> multiplying<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.080> a

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
robot would be like multiplying that a

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.329 
robot would be like multiplying that a
thousandfold<00:01:02.510> however<00:01:03.510> he<00:01:04.350> gave<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.769> access

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
thousandfold however he gave one access

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.969 
thousandfold however he gave one access
for<00:01:05.610> familiarity<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:07.799> also

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
for familiarity and there was also

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.580 
for familiarity and there was also
negative<00:01:08.369> familiarity<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.840> generally<00:01:10.380> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
negative familiarity but generally in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
negative familiarity but generally in
cognitive<00:01:11.340> psychology<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.480> think

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
cognitive psychology we don't think

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
cognitive psychology we don't think
about<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.350> being<00:01:13.560> such<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:14.010> as

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
about there being such a thing as

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.300 
about there being such a thing as
negative<00:01:14.960> familiarity<00:01:15.960> things<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> novel

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
negative familiarity things can be novel

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
negative familiarity things can be novel
or<00:01:17.670> extremely<00:01:18.120> novel<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.780> there's<00:01:18.990> no

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
or extremely novel but there's no

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
or extremely novel but there's no
negative<00:01:19.680> familiarity<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.060> seemed<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
negative familiarity so it seemed that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
negative familiarity so it seemed that
he<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.780> confounding<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.950> different

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
he was confounding to different

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.810 
he was confounding to different
dimensions<00:01:24.060> novelty<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.490> valence<00:01:26.490> or

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
dimensions novelty and valence or

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
dimensions novelty and valence or
hedonic<00:01:27.330> value<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.320> pleasure<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
hedonic value which is like pleasure and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.730 
hedonic value which is like pleasure and
pain<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.479> example<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:31.050> this<00:01:31.200> slide<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.710> see

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pain so for example in this slide we see

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.070 
pain so for example in this slide we see
a<00:01:31.950> reward<00:01:32.400> curve<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.120> a<00:01:33.240> punishment<00:01:33.600> curve

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
a reward curve and a punishment curve

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.490 
a reward curve and a punishment curve
now<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.340> thinking<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:36.500> aesthetic

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
now in thinking about aesthetic

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.430 
now in thinking about aesthetic
experience<00:01:38.299> bunt<00:01:39.299> had<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> idea<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.200> adding

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
experience bunt had the idea of adding

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.890 
experience bunt had the idea of adding
these<00:01:40.799> curves<00:01:41.159> together<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.690> provides

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
these curves together so this provides

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.320 
these curves together so this provides
the<00:01:43.650> black<00:01:44.250> curve<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> center<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
the black curve in the center of the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.539 
the black curve in the center of the
vent<00:01:45.570> curve<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.740> might<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> some

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
vent curve so we might think of some

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.539 
vent curve so we might think of some
very<00:01:47.880> novel<00:01:48.510> art<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.710> music<00:01:49.740> such<00:01:50.520> as

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
very novel art or music such as

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.719 
very novel art or music such as
Stravinsky's<00:01:51.270> Rite<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.570> Spring<00:01:51.869> being

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring being

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.399 
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring being
disturbingly<00:01:53.729> novel<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.869> too<00:01:55.170> new

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
disturbingly novel because it's too new

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
disturbingly novel because it's too new
and<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.400> make<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.940> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and we don't know what to make of it and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
and we don't know what to make of it and
eventually<00:01:57.900> we<00:01:58.290> become<00:01:58.710> habituated<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.580> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
eventually we become habituated and it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.820 
eventually we become habituated and it
might<00:01:59.820> become<00:02:00.210> boring<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> middle<00:02:01.710> we

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
might become boring but in the middle we

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.920 
might become boring but in the middle we

Android that can be quite eerie and if
we<00:02:38.280> look<00:02:38.400> at<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> kind<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.030> strange<00:02:39.420> familiar

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
we look at a kind of strange familiar

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.590 
we look at a kind of strange familiar
access<00:02:40.770> than<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.190> also<00:02:41.370> find<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.390> of

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
access than we also find this kind of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.430 
access than we also find this kind of
uncanny<00:02:43.050> valley<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.660> example<00:02:46.140> we're

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
uncanny valley and in this example we're

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.400 
uncanny valley and in this example we're
going<00:02:46.709> from<00:02:46.920> ella<00:02:47.760> VA<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.870> based<00:02:49.200> on

going from ella VA which is based on
waka<00:02:49.680> Maru<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:51.650> Android<00:02:52.650> Ripley<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> q1<00:02:53.959> Expo<00:02:54.959> to

waka Maru to Android Ripley a q1 Expo to
the<00:02:56.069> model<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> rep<00:02:57.000> Lee<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> q1<00:02:57.660> Expo<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.319> we

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
the model for a rep Lee a q1 Expo and we

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.410 
the model for a rep Lee a q1 Expo and we
also<00:02:59.069> find<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.640> similar<00:02:59.940> uncanny<00:03:00.600> valley

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
also find a similar uncanny valley

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.420 
also find a similar uncanny valley
however<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.660> there's<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.140> limitation<00:03:05.040> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
however I think there's a limitation of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.640 
however I think there's a limitation of
from<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.910> sort<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.470> experiment<00:03:07.470> because

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
from this sort of experiment because

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.630 
from this sort of experiment because
we're<00:03:07.950> only<00:03:08.130> looking<00:03:08.370> at<00:03:08.670> still<00:03:09.180> images<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
we're only looking at still images and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.309 
we're only looking at still images and
how<00:03:11.640> important<00:03:12.180> could<00:03:12.299> still<00:03:12.569> images<00:03:13.080> be

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
how important could still images be

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.229 
how important could still images be
they're<00:03:13.530> not<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:14.069> an<00:03:14.340> important<00:03:14.819> part<00:03:15.090> of

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
they're not really an important part of

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.010 
they're not really an important part of
