00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.000
 6.9 and I am so early 3 to 5 5 May 11 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.269
 but again it is not so long ago 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.459
 but at the bottom of the map 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.279
 reduces Olonets appetite in 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.289
 today you can fly for example under 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.139
 at this year prices 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.400
 and the boys and girls who left 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 a peak of the right mouse button we fly up 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 committee him what should fly when in 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.839
 the main stage should be this garbage 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:28.749
 and you are sitting 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.220
 a bird like this 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.630
 enough 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.740
 just enough 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.490
 Well, here's a way to this method at home 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.900
 simpler than this demand 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.660
 also present here 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 every crease where there are such here 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.710
 so this is what brand for example m 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.930
 to get into space 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.350
 let's zenith on travel but on 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900
 this planet 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.040
 difference from an ordinary planet to counties 20 to 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.260
 hundreds when could not fall under what 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.220
 that way ss are becoming 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.070
 so here 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310
 he recognizes neither his nor our notion 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.340
 gravity then there is this one and 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.140
 so the rest is very interesting 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 in this game so travel with us here 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.320
 so changes are very interesting things 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.110
 also here there is such a gente 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.280
 romania which is also changing 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.180
 to screaming 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.680
 when Islam Europe here such 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.280
 generator 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.040
 the plan itself can not afford 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.250
 luckily named gravity ok 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 4 so participate in the opening parade 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.150
 center 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.100
 I know what was put April 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.870
 find her planet for example sleep now 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.770
 you can grow any 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 products can also grow dynamo all 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.450
 same rent now we understand how so 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.260
 to sleep 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.830
 so strange 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.150
 we need 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.280
 Donetsk Arctic such special beds 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.299
 this is bed practice salads from solid 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.590
 but such as tactical carpet 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.080
 that rolls just like that 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.040
 film girls who seem and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.290
 light and 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.639
 and here is the author's aunt 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.669
 similarly when investors close 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.549
 the harvest does not sleep and so on 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.599
 usually when we have a gun we can't 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.760
 find more you can count meadows 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.019
 any 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.889
 data on the ground earlier on the eve of his home 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.979
 speaking 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.669
 so what 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.199
 and at least such a planet rubles 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.599
 no, don't despair when you can't 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.609
 so nothing to put the songs sharper from 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.399
 normal world bosnian 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.739
 and yakraz bodies bodies bed swelling 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.109
 km h is not all that is present 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.609
 there is enough here 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.119
 interesting 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.839
 but every movie is a fly 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.619
 in celebrate fly 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.619
 representative of the MCH 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.399
 Of course the topic there up 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.219
 when you see that this is a bed 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.289
 attached as if very bad but when 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.409
 currency 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.219
 Dagestan lights Matua we see that this 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.939
 do not side 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.389
 we need a pistol that this week 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.359
 class criticism asus understand what the window 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.249
 big enough height we need 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.579
 rise 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.749
 but here I do not know with what help here 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.049
 could something change 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.269
 maybe just a block to have neither 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.489
 Emelyanov people just climb 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.479
 great andron miracle 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.669
 and here on now knows right click 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.939
 Chambers of the Tambov River of Blood find ourselves in 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.759
 year of such in space 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.739
 it's really interesting and beautiful looking 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.790
 that's there almost explained ia Reiter 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.079
 ordinary with a scale of 1 9x mentions 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.900
 in the press center of the car factory to do 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.209
 flowers 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.039
 Petrovich Klyuev is looking for 100 units 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.779
 flying setun organization what 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.169
 habitual was and so on that bunch 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.399
 there are planets 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.929
 they are also here saturn there never 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.159
 its such subjective dtsp 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.180
 novelty characters and asteroid name from 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.459
 planets have a planet you are such 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.669
 if people have not usually been rendered 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.329
 never 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.589
 interest is a flower 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.549
 here is or very beautiful planet but 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.619
 it is like a planet covered in flowers 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:11.419
 eg 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.989
 so maybe we are lucky and we 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.929
 find planets asteroid i have 

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:19.019
 very rarely but still time 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.799
 past 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.550
 so there still on the planet's boat is there 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.249
 not yet here 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.419
 these are the interesting planets 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.069
 became the planet in the bush family all 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.680
 it was she who 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.969
 but they don't care what grows 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.689
 on every planet talk at home what's next 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.379
 grow and the insides of the planet they are everywhere 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.870
 the same 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.810
 never probably see this is called 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.150
 in new planets saturn site 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.949
 rare planet at all times meet 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.699
 vodka and so it is beautiful in the end 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.150
 that's how that like rainbow may and 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.750
 and here inside there even trees grow you 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.889
 we still have such an aggressive rainbow 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.199
 everyone has 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.289
 like that she was somebody 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.469
 to this planet network stickers 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.409
 mobile to the planet 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.749
 that's how we see 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:12.199
 introduce siesta belgium and all that 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.389
 exactly the first game in attack so ball it 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.590
 money is different 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.280
 if you mention cedar revolution 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.300
 will be here 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.729
 but unrealistic because of the whole visit to us 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.710
 you have to do it 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.830
 like this 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.849
 but Vsevolozhsk goes 7 2 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.020
 and city pickets prime blue 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.589
 in money 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.179
 the yield on them can still be seen 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:36.819
 inside when platoon 3 come in 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.819
 in Russia it starts 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.349
 done and 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.999
 developments 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.020
 it is not very beautiful and 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.330
 and I am very well 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.409
 ibid when she is here in space to her 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.409
 their day for some reason does not change 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.860
 me 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.119
 all the time is gone 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.979
 But such an interesting idea review 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.459
 the model is quite interesting that is 

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.349
 this is me gravity and try to go back on 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:05.379
 the ground 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.770
 I think I will succeed because he is so 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.930
 we observe 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.229
 nonetheless 20 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.559
 estimates oilmen eat back 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:14.930
 fire resistance 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.860
 go in the mission quietly 5 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.090
 pistol back and forth and objectivity of may 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.819
 sent the mouse button 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.069
 May not be the same 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.430
 and if there is him yet 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.990
 the present tribute net be a little lower here 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.820
 Here begins such a beauty and 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.430
 tekiev only self loads from this 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.059
 snack world ideas and 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.499
 and see again and where we find ourselves we 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:39.499
 We appear highly highly 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.699
 punished very high 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:50.189
 the first batch of people on a boat on this 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.539
 sometimes water is supplied to another place 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.509
 By the way to win all the time in discord 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:57.919
 there are in different ends of humor award 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.669
 but they all the time we will go to the same thing 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.830
 take asia 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.520
 in the same place 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.599
 similarly andro topuria 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.020
 further and so on 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.809
 Well, that's all I think you were interested 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:14.430
 in his report still unattended 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.020
 bye everyone
