00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.240
 we have not shown you yet 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.460

 something on xbox 360 on playstation3 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.850
 No one could stop setting up 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.910
 good account for that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 gigantic we over the unbelievable 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.510
 high quality master mass of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.510
 best consoles games of the year blogs 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.720
 Assassin's creed 3 is assassin's creed 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 3 the hero changes from the noble one 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.560
 key eto to the half indian connor 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.050
 and the scene of europe the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.040
 renaissance in america the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.650
 independence wars and the new 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.450
 Scenario really scares us about assassin's 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.950
 creed 3 offers an incredible 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.660
 detailed world a gripping 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.890
 history and above all technical 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.930
 several improvements 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 the series typical of Schleich and Michael 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320
 gameplay is even more supple 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.880
 by the hand and that is with everything 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 graphic bombast really that 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.910
 leading 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.979
 Borderlands 2 It's a clever one 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.600
 idea of ​​gearbox software been with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.119
 Borderlands the two popular genres 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 to connect ego shooter and roleplay 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 and this year a second part 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 nachzuschieben 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.750
 so you can not even in borderlands 2 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 just enjoy fast action but 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.979
 is on top of that in a spiral collection 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500
 pulled the again and again 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.840
 motivated for even better equipment 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.060
 therefore, the second one plays 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 Part is also excellent and is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.729
 even at all corners and ends 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.009
 been improved 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 but the icing is the coop 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.710
 Mode for up to four human 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710
 weapons are friends 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.790
 call of duty black ops 2 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.380
 not only the pc but also the three hd 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.090
 Consoles will of course be with theirs 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.850
 own version of call of duty black 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.620
 Ops 2 supplies and makes trucks 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.330
 virtual michael bay film also in the 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.310
 rage loaded socket for the sofa 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.910
 and gamepad faction a really good one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.830
 figure 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.930
 thus can affect consoles owners 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.940
 without hesitation on long multiplayer evenings 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.660
 and a short but important campaign 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.730
 looking forward 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.760
 typical call of duty in the dax is the 2 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.130
 The darksiders series is criticized 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.380
 often as zelda abschach with gloomy 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.330
 look dismissed but that will make you 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.400
 excellent action adventure barely 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.350
 fair here is not only true 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.140
 the gameplay in the imaginative and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.030
 fantastic design dungeons but also 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.540
 the dark comic design can see itself 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.670
 to let 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.650
 In addition, there is the apocalyptic 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.610
 rider called death really one 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.660
 Sucking videogame heroes off in sóller 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.550
 become the mask of zorro up to date 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.959
 play more and more often criticized for it 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.910
 that they are permanently the same style 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.610
 pursue and playfully only very much 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
 offer few freedoms 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.239
 if you think that looks alright then 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 the note is exactly your game that 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.750
 action roleplay with the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.430
 ego-perspective does not only inspire with 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.320
 the outstanding designed steampunk 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 world but also with a huge 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.340
 freedom of action in each his own 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.080
 can live out individual play style 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.519
 because how many action games do you have in 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.299
 Last time you played in those 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.280
 theoretically nobody has to kill far 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.410
 cry 3 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.690
 after the Africa trip in part 2 goes 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.459
 it with far cry 3 back to the island 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.320
 but of course no one expects you 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.090
 Shabby beach holiday in the paradise 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.549
 but you end up in a tropical 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.650
 hell in the drug slave trader and 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.890
 raw violence instead of cocktails announced 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.290
 are 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.209
 like the predecessors dances far too 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.760
 cry 3 compared to the usual 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.520
 global law scenarios clearly from the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.110
 row and also the many players 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.000
 between freedoms and the open 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.740
 game world borders the title of the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.540
 numerous tubes shoot off the in 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.380
 the last years to the genre standard 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.280
 became 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:58.040
 the third definition official fifa 13 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.360
 well, you could fifa 13 2 accuse 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.880
 that it's just an annual one again 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 update is but the content was in the 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.030
 always very good 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.590
 there are still some to come this year 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.210
 innovations that one finds in a fleeting 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.950
 look at the game does not notice 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.480
 but certainly worth mentioning 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.030
 have an impact on the gameplay 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.410
 for example, a revised ki and 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.750
 the new ball control 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.730
 Thus , as expected, again 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.120
 absolutely excellent football game 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.120
 delivered 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.480
 forza horizon the xbox exclusive 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.250
 preview series is one of the best 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.470
 the racing game genre has to offer 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.900
 horizon came up with so many in october 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.120
 such as the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.040
 huge free passable area in the 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.080
 virtual colorado and those with 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.300
 neon color interspersed presentation in the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.250
 style from there already the old researcher 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.590
 pluses like perfect physics 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.480
 or the incredible number of too 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.350
 coping events are here for 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.970
 luck 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.410
 in short, probably the best 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.410
 racing game of the year 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.620
 Halo 4 after the band is different from the 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.240
 halo row has renounced feared the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.669
 fans about the quality of the future 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.379
 serial and fortunately have 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.759
 But these fears are completely complete 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.770
 unnecessarily exposed 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.719
 the new developer free for free 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.639
 Industries has managed the typical 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.139
 halo atmosphere capture and the 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.120
 master chiefs a campaign of 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.610
 playful and technically usual higher 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.050
 Quality is what matters 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.000
 new story arc with fresh 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.759
 opponents and the great multiplayer mode 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.409
 Halo 4 thus closes qualitatively seamlessly 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:38.590
 to his predecessors mass effect 3 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.270
 yes we also know that not all fans 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.650
 with the possible ends of mass effect 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.469
 3 are satisfied 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.270
 but honestly the controversial 15 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.569
 minutes to go dozens 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.620
 fun hours in advance in which the 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.180
 action-packed space missions with 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.699
 commander shepard hollywood mature 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.729
 are staged thus remains in sum 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.650
 an absolutely top-class scifi experience 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.690
 that again with many emotional 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.699
 highlights and is in front of you 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.099
 many difficult decisions 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.199
 represents mass effect 3 offers the trilogy 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.800
 So the worthy conclusion you 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.800
 has earned 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.899
 yes, there are noted in this category 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.610
 It is much more player than in all 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:22.289
 other categories we have been to you so far 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.209
 have shown it is simply because 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.789
 that time the console games the big one 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.899
 broad mass of all games 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.639
 that appears in the year 

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:32.369
 complicated sentence interleaving 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.389
 galore and therefore us, the vase 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.709
 That's why I always said it hard 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.449
 you can take that a little bit bigger 

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:37.649
 So most of the games 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.020
 somehow there we are for the 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:41.429
 nomination opportunities we have 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.080
 Much discussed that could us 

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:44.669
 believe the editorial has been long 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.439
 I quarreled and in the end I am 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.539
 enforced because fun 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.709
 but as I said there are many chances 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.939
 There are many manufacturers there are many 

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:56.429
 many manufacturers practice this unfortunately 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.539
 year with the dlc not there but me 

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:59.339
 I am convinced if the next 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.240
 But I do not care about it 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.649
 think we have a colorful mix 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.689
 each found determined by you 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.879
 one or two favorites one 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:10.219
 may it be at the end of the day 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:10.219
 pick out and vote with her 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:17.519
 no matter if you already know who wants whom

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:21.539
 are also against sugar de do not you 

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:23.069
 only the voting form but in 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.389
 this and the next days on the 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.550
 website and also in our youtube 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:29.129
 channel more categories we will be the 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.659
 let virtually by abo ie if they do 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:32.759
 Not all nominees are named then 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:34.019
