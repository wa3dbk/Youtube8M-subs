00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.950
 hello everyone with you mobile channel review 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.410
 eldar murtazin talk today about 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.200
 Wipe x2 about this device that will not be 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.350
 delivered to Russia he is right he 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.960
 completely identical to wipe x2 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.830
 this is a layered design if you remember here 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.840
 these layers but unlike x2 and here 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.830
 count once two three four layers if 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.399
 read the screen here too 4 but for 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.800
 the color count in general is not visible i 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.890
 heard the version that this one 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.079
 the device allegedly this device weighs 140 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.570
 gram bed at 120 here because he 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.000
 really metal and this 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.850
 plastic again emphasize to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.969
 apparatus metallic contrast 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.070
 is that this metal is very 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.489
 thin looks like plastic really looks like 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.270
 plastic as well as in many laptops 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.939
 lenovo where is the declared metal he is here he 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.119
 exactly the same ie he is not 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.990
 perceived as metal color 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.250
 solution champagne and back cover i have me 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.100
 absolutely identical cameras if 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.080
 look there is here and here 13 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 megapixels led flash 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.270
 it would seem the difference between these devices 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.540
 but they differ primarily in those 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.990
 That they have different screens, both screens are full 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.850
 hd 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.369
 but in one case the screen is 5 inches 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.700
 another case is 5 3 inches here a little more 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.240
 brightness otherwise everything they are completely 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.810
 similar and no different 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.159
 the difference that strikes the eye 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:52.939
 5 megapixel front camera white 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.130
 x2 pro version is 13 megapixel 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.700
 camera for selfi more for this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.770
 apparatus 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 released a special flash to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.439
 Sorry I do not have it, it is inserted here 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.659
 here 8 LED flash for selfie on 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.539
 short distance why madness 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.090
 madness but still there is such a thing 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.590
 not something this device reminding 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.010
 Here are the looks and size of z3 from sony they 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.560
 very similar in size to some extent 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.510
 on aesthetics in terms of here 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.730
 Although I like sony more 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.549
 significantly but at least this 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.540
 lenovo unlike the same s90 which 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.580
 everyone calls 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.099
 copies of iphone 6 it has a certain look 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.739
 There are several settings that like me 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.890
 seems like people quicksnap 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.400
 this setting which allows closed 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.769
 mode 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.769
 press the key twice quickly 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.870
 adjust any volume and get 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.329
 snapshot you right there 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.760
 in general, you can see the camera 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.810
 This way it is started 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 convenient but beyond that there is the possibility 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.790
 shake the phone in order to shake 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.590
 for something to happen in your pocket 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.160
 volume up and so on 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.970
 thing but it's all standard because well 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.290
 Of course, she probably is so dishonest 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.400
 unshaven and in general it means that I am 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:27.889
 I'm moving now is beauty fashion 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.760
 in fact , look at me now 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.510
 handsome 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:38.120
 will turn them monster don't know these 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 let's see no cutting here here 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.889
 beatification did so see 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:53.959
 zamylil a very strong picture picture 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:57.970
 blurred in terms of me 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:02.110
 was beautiful still here 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.320
 set up to respond to gestures 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.690
 Well, for example , on such a camera 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.680
 typical enough for this kind 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.110
 the device does not have any differences and if 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.430
 look about the settings that are 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.030
 inside this is a typical white x2 with one 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.450
 honors 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.720
 oh with one difference here was mediatek 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.710
 65 95 eight-core here with us dragon 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.680
 615 is also the eight-core snapdragon and 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.450
 battery a little more than 2410 milliamps 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.190
 hour if you look at this device is 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.540
 he gives out in virtual parrots 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.730
 performance less than mediatek 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.360
 but at the same time it works from the battery 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.320
 longer 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.020
 which of course will be pleasant for many 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.730
 The advantage of this device is that it 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.430
 really from morning to evening lives in 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.530
 while wipe x2 on the library 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.040
 sits down to dinner guaranteed well then 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.070
 There is a dead battery in this plan 2 sim 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.110
 cards can insert memory size 32 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.330
 gigabyte memory card is not present 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.370
 SIM cards for some reason in the specification 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:19.120
 appears as exclusively applied though 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.610
 here in my pubic it is nano sim and micro 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.700
 sim that is you can put either 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.990
 so pouring such a metal tray 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.250
 snaps in, that is, everything is enough 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.320
 simple and clear in the bottom line in 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.890
 Russia supplied this unit is not 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.720
 will be in ps2 pro will be judged delivered 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.820
 around the only found global market 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.979
 This is China's home market for Lenovo 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.100
 the cost of this device is $ 500 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.800
 do i need 13 megapixels for selfie 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.110
 it remains a mystery to me covered in darkness 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.090
 but this apparatus has two advantages 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.650
 over original wipe x2 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.289
 And a little more screen 5 3 inches slightly brighter 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.939
 the screen is a little better 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.860
 slightly more updated version let's drink 2 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:09.680
 the old version is already there is some update of this 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.089
 versions but the most important thing is that time is work 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.279
 which was a minus for 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.999
 x2 here it is fixed that is full 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.849
 working day 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:21.499
 the machine still pulls thanks 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.879
 snapdragon 615 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.460
 that's all I wanted to say 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:28.309
