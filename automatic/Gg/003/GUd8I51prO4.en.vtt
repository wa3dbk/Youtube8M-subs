00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
still got the 5000 kV motor in it I got

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.049 
still got the 5000 kV motor in it I got
the<00:00:13.019> new<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.650> don't<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.099> had<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.400> spur

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the new I don't know if I had that spur

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.920 
the new I don't know if I had that spur
gear<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.660> think<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.960> did<00:00:17.900> right<00:00:18.900> now

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
gear on there I think I did right now

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.220 
gear on there I think I did right now
I'm<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.289> using<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.279> airplane<00:00:21.230> flight

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
I'm just using two of my airplane flight

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.759 
I'm just using two of my airplane flight
Mac's<00:00:22.529> batteries<00:00:23.269> 2200<00:00:24.269> mah<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.109> think<00:00:25.410> 30<00:00:26.010> C<00:00:26.510> so

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
Mac's batteries 2200 mah I think 30 C so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
Mac's batteries 2200 mah I think 30 C so
they're<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:29.220> quite<00:00:29.849> enough<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.689> run

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
they're not quite enough to really run

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.569 
they're not quite enough to really run
this<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.820> gonna<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.410> quick<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
this so I'm just gonna be quick but I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.470 
this so I'm just gonna be quick but I
got<00:00:36.090> my<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:37.010> ant<00:00:38.010> meter<00:00:38.399> running<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
got my little ant meter running here and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
got my little ant meter running here and
kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.170> says<00:00:40.410> 1.5<00:00:41.100> walk<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.700> just

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
kind of see it says 1.5 walk that's just

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.799 
kind of see it says 1.5 walk that's just
sitting<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.270> an<00:00:42.360> idle<00:00:42.629> right<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.980> but<00:00:43.980> um<00:00:44.809> it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
sitting in an idle right now but um it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.950 
sitting in an idle right now but um it's
kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.050> playing<00:00:46.320> around<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.890> it's

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
kind of playing around with it it's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
kind of playing around with it it's
pretty<00:00:48.960> good<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:49.500> spar<00:00:49.920> speed<00:00:50.460> goes

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
pretty good right now spar speed goes

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
pretty good right now spar speed goes
but<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> Cuong<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> amps

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
but it's kind of Cuong a lot of amps

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.889 
but it's kind of Cuong a lot of amps
without<00:00:53.670> even<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> load<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.480> because<00:00:54.750> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
without even a load that's because it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.209 
without even a load that's because it's
a<00:00:54.960> high<00:00:55.110> kV<00:00:55.559> motor<00:00:55.800> once<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.000> down<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.010> kV<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
a high kV motor once I down the kV the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.799 
a high kV motor once I down the kV the
motor<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:01.850> up<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.090> volts<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.629> bit

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
motor and and up the volts a little bit

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.490 
motor and and up the volts a little bit
should<00:01:04.110> drop<00:01:04.350> down<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> amperage<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:06.540> here

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
should drop down the amperage but here

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:17.649 
should drop down the amperage but here
it<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:12.619> both<00:01:13.619> fans<00:01:14.010> come<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> motor<00:01:16.380> only

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
it is both fans come on the motor only

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
it is both fans come on the motor only
it's<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.950> too<00:01:19.950> hyper<00:01:20.189> 3<00:01:20.670> Heidi<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> little

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
it's like too hyper 3 Heidi and a little

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's like too hyper 3 Heidi and a little
beat<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:22.500> does<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.310> throttle

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
beat only does that if your throttle

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
beat only does that if your throttle
Center<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.509> throttles<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.020> centered<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Center if your throttles not centered it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010 
Center if your throttles not centered it
won't<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.030> thought<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.360> for

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
won't do that I kind of thought that for

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.090 
won't do that I kind of thought that for
a<00:01:28.049> first<00:01:28.350> couple<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> times<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.220> turned<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> on

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
a first couple of times I turned it on

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.170 
a first couple of times I turned it on
didn't<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.790> turning<00:01:33.000> on

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
didn't think it was actually turning on

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.179 
didn't think it was actually turning on
wasn't<00:01:33.450> working<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.710> father<00:01:34.920> wasn't

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
wasn't working because the father wasn't

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.240 
wasn't working because the father wasn't

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.280 
that record is just the piece so they'll
all<00:02:38.670> stay<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.990> low<00:02:40.140> voltage

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
all stay on there and the low voltage

00:02:42.290 --> 00:03:02.440 
all stay on there and the low voltage
lowest<00:02:43.290> voltage<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.860> dropped<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> during<00:02:44.760> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.520 

we<00:03:03.450> got<00:03:03.600> up<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.920> 802<00:03:04.920> watts<00:03:05.220> at<00:03:06.050> 95.9<00:03:07.050> ants

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
we got up to 802 watts at 95.9 ants

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.479 
we got up to 802 watts at 95.9 ants
which<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.700> too<00:03:09.480> much<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.870> these<00:03:09.959> batteries

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
which is too much for these batteries

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.120 
which is too much for these batteries
they're<00:03:11.489> not<00:03:11.850> puffed<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.270> or<00:03:12.450> anything

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
they're not puffed up or anything

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.750 
they're not puffed up or anything
that's<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:14.790> far<00:03:16.190> 95.9<00:03:17.190> amps<00:03:17.610> at

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that's what it is so far 95.9 amps at

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.740 
that's what it is so far 95.9 amps at
802<00:03:18.480> watts<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.320> no<00:03:19.350> load<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.100> it

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
802 watts and that's with no load on it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.800 
802 watts and that's with no load on it
so<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.320> really<00:03:22.950> need<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.130> down<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.700> kg<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
so I really need to down that kg of a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.729 
so I really need to down that kg of a
motor<00:03:25.020> it's<00:03:25.950> too<00:03:26.100> high<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.600> when<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.410> get<00:03:28.590> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
motor it's too high so when I get that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.710 
motor it's too high so when I get that
in<00:03:28.980> I'll<00:03:29.400> go<00:03:29.610> ahead<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.000> update<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
in I'll go ahead and update you on the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.780 
in I'll go ahead and update you on the
video<00:03:32.810> yeah<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.260> I'm<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.160> running<00:03:35.550> both

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
video yeah and I'm just running both

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.290 
video yeah and I'm just running both
these<00:03:36.000> batteries<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:37.100> parallel<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:38.640> they're

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
these batteries in parallel so they're

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.970 
these batteries in parallel so they're
still<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.660> same<00:03:39.720> voltage<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.680> jump

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
still the same voltage it just jump

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.870 
still the same voltage it just jump
doubles<00:03:41.400> two<00:03:42.410> million<00:03:43.410> powers<00:03:43.770> in<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.130> amps

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
doubles two million powers in the amps

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.339 
doubles two million powers in the amps
so<00:03:46.220> that's<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.430> for<00:03:47.640> now

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
so that's it for now

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.069 
so that's it for now
and<00:03:49.790> if<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.909> do<00:03:50.969> anything<00:03:51.209> else<00:03:51.540> I'll<00:03:51.749> update

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
and if I do anything else I'll update

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.289 
and if I do anything else I'll update
you<00:03:52.290> or<00:03:52.920> I'll<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.579> go<00:03:53.730> ahead<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.969> update<00:03:54.060> you

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
you or I'll just go ahead and update you

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.470 
you or I'll just go ahead and update you
wants<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.629> parking<00:03:55.079> but<00:03:55.980> um<00:03:56.189> I'll<00:03:56.849> see<00:03:57.389> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
wants to get parking but um I'll see you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.890 
wants to get parking but um I'll see you
guys<00:03:57.599> later

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
guys later

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.640 
guys later
but<00:03:59.180> I'm<00:04:00.180> sorry<00:04:00.450> guys<00:04:00.689> I<00:04:00.900> realized<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.409> didn't

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
but I'm sorry guys I realized I didn't

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.119 
but I'm sorry guys I realized I didn't
actually<00:04:01.829> show<00:04:02.189> you<00:04:02.249> this<00:04:02.599> stand<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:03.749> made<00:04:04.129> it's

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
actually show you this stand I made it's

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.899 
actually show you this stand I made it's
made<00:04:05.340> out<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.549> blue<00:04:06.030> core<00:04:07.519> pretty<00:04:08.519> much<00:04:08.700> just

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
made out of blue core pretty much just

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.249 
made out of blue core pretty much just
fairly<00:04:09.439> thin<00:04:10.439> sheets<00:04:11.389> of<00:04:13.400> foam<00:04:14.400> it's<00:04:14.760> got<00:04:14.909> a

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
fairly thin sheets of foam it's got a

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:20.150 
fairly thin sheets of foam it's got a
slight<00:04:17.810> plastic<00:04:18.810> layer<00:04:19.139> on<00:04:19.380> each<00:04:19.530> side<00:04:19.889> I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
slight plastic layer on each side I

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.129 
slight plastic layer on each side I
would<00:04:20.759> had<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.120> make<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> little<00:04:21.509> cut<00:04:21.720> out<00:04:21.780> here

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
would had to make a little cut out here

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.020 
would had to make a little cut out here
to<00:04:22.289> fit<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> steering<00:04:22.979> servo<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.580> everything

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
to fit the steering servo and everything

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.240 
to fit the steering servo and everything
and<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.930> fits<00:04:25.139> down<00:04:25.380> right<00:04:25.680> in<00:04:25.830> between<00:04:25.949> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
and it fits down right in between the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.170 
and it fits down right in between the
chassis<00:04:27.139> but<00:04:28.139> that's<00:04:28.770> pretty<00:04:29.220> much<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.699> fairly

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
chassis but that's pretty much it fairly

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.779 
chassis but that's pretty much it fairly
straightforward<00:04:30.930> as<00:04:31.710> far<00:04:31.919> as<00:04:32.039> measurements

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
straightforward as far as measurements

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.990 
straightforward as far as measurements
so<00:04:33.479> I<00:04:33.509> don't<00:04:33.810> know<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:33.990> just<00:04:34.580> kind<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.729> guessed

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
so I don't know I just kind of guessed

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.749 
so I don't know I just kind of guessed
as<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.300> built<00:04:36.539> it<00:04:36.919> had<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.070> truck<00:04:38.310> sitting<00:04:38.580> next

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
as I built it had the truck sitting next

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.060 
as I built it had the truck sitting next
to<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.180> it's<00:04:39.900> pretty<00:04:40.110> much<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.560> still<00:04:40.770> has<00:04:40.949> all

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
to it it's pretty much it still has all

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.159 
to it it's pretty much it still has all
my<00:04:41.300> 3.3<00:04:42.300> stickers<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.900> stuff

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
my 3.3 stickers and stuff

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.560 
my 3.3 stickers and stuff
it<00:04:43.530> had<00:04:43.889> to<00:04:43.979> be<00:04:44.009> funny<00:04:44.280> with<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.639> roughs<00:04:45.389> of

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
it had to be funny with the roughs of

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.040 
it had to be funny with the roughs of
trucks<00:04:45.900> at<00:04:46.110> night<00:04:46.639> but<00:04:47.639> um<00:04:47.910> just<00:04:48.150> thought<00:04:48.930> I'd

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
trucks at night but um just thought I'd

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.439 
trucks at night but um just thought I'd
show<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.320> guys<00:04:51.289> but<00:04:52.289> it's<00:04:52.590> pretty<00:04:52.770> much<00:04:52.979> it

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
show you guys but it's pretty much it

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.599 
show you guys but it's pretty much it
thanks<00:04:54.449> guys
