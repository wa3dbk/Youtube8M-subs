00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.639 
kettle and holding it in place with two
clamps<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.110> sure<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> grain

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
clamps just to make sure when the grain

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.049 
clamps just to make sure when the grain
falls<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.219> doesn't<00:00:53.519> just<00:00:53.640> take<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> whole

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
falls and it doesn't just take the whole

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
falls and it doesn't just take the whole
bag<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.269> with<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:56.000> I've<00:00:57.000> got<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.739> water

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
bag in with it I've got my water

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
bag in with it I've got my water
temperature<00:00:59.399> is<00:01:00.199> just<00:01:01.199> above<00:01:01.320> 158<00:01:02.629> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
temperature is just above 158 I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.260 
temperature is just above 158 I'm
expecting<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.409> drop<00:01:04.729> just<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.090> bit

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
expecting that to drop just a little bit

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
expecting that to drop just a little bit
once<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> drain<00:01:06.869> goes<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:09.950> I've<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:11.130> 8

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
once the drain goes in I've got 8

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850 
once the drain goes in I've got 8
gallons<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.149> water<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> five

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
gallons of water in here this is a five

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.560 
gallons of water in here this is a five
gallon<00:01:14.070> batch<00:01:16.039> normally<00:01:17.039> I<00:01:17.070> would<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.429> a<00:01:17.570> 10

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
gallon batch normally I would do a 10

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.779 
gallon batch normally I would do a 10
gallon<00:01:18.720> batch<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.289> since<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.100> first

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
gallon batch but since this is a first

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.910 
gallon batch but since this is a first
time<00:01:20.850> trial<00:01:21.270> run<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:21.960> we'll<00:01:22.890> see

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
time trial run kind of thing we'll see

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.870 
time trial run kind of thing we'll see
how<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> goes<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.050> five<00:01:25.050> green<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
how it goes with the five green with a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.359 
how it goes with the five green with a
five<00:01:27.210> gallon<00:01:27.420> batch<00:01:27.690> instead<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.380> single

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
five gallon batch instead of a single

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
five gallon batch instead of a single
dish<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:30.899> gonna<00:01:31.080> go<00:01:31.200> ahead<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.440> pour<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
dish so I'm gonna go ahead and pour the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:02:19.890 
dish so I'm gonna go ahead and pour the
green<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.550> won't<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.300> how<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.479> goes

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.860 

okay<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:20.960> it<00:02:21.230> all<00:02:21.350> went<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:21.920> easy

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
okay so it all went in really easy

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.970 
okay so it all went in really easy
really<00:02:23.870> loose<00:02:24.170> mesh<00:02:24.500> which<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.580> expected

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
really loose mesh which is expected

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.120 
really loose mesh which is expected
temperature<00:02:27.980> drop<00:02:28.220> down<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:30.050> under<00:02:30.260> 155

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
temperature drop down to just under 155

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.680 
temperature drop down to just under 155
which<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> great<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.120> now<00:02:32.300> I'm<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.480> going<00:02:32.630> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
which is great so now I'm just going to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.610 
which is great so now I'm just going to
put<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> lid<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:33.890> top<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.470> walk<00:02:36.470> away

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
put a lid on top of this and walk away

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:52.530 
put a lid on top of this and walk away
come<00:02:36.830> back<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:37.040> little<00:02:37.190> later<00:02:50.080> but<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> point<00:02:51.560> 8

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
come back a little later but a point 8

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.580 
come back a little later but a point 8
degree<00:02:53.540> temperature<00:02:53.959> drop<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.320> been<00:03:00.500> an

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
degree temperature drop so it's been an

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.520 
degree temperature drop so it's been an
hour

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
hour

00:03:02.530 --> 00:05:23.590 
hour
yeah<00:03:04.090> I'm<00:03:05.090> sure<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.630> chopped<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.610> 151

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.500 

all<00:05:24.600> right<00:05:24.870> so

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.400 

got<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.790> burner<00:05:29.790> on<00:05:30.030> and<00:05:32.990> go<00:05:33.990> ahead<00:05:34.200> bring

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
got the burner on and go ahead bring

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.050 
got the burner on and go ahead bring
this<00:05:34.530> up<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.920> boil<00:05:35.130> I'm<00:05:35.460> gonna<00:05:35.670> go<00:05:35.820> ahead<00:05:35.940> and

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
this up to a boil I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:46.359 
this up to a boil I'm gonna go ahead and
add<00:05:36.270> in<00:05:36.480> my<00:05:37.160> first<00:05:38.160> down<00:05:38.340> for<00:05:38.490> right<00:05:39.090> now

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:46.369 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:06:05.480 

so<00:05:47.369> counting

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.490 

we're<00:06:06.490> starting<00:06:06.790> to<00:06:06.850> boil<00:06:07.030> so<00:06:07.480> start<00:06:08.410> the

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
we're starting to boil so start the

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:18.690 
we're starting to boil so start the
timer<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:12.720> another<00:06:13.720> ounce<00:06:13.990> of<00:06:14.140> hop<00:06:17.700> Cascade

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
timer and another ounce of hop Cascade

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.270 
timer and another ounce of hop Cascade
hops<00:06:18.880> I'm<00:06:19.180> just<00:06:19.360> adding<00:06:19.570> uh<00:06:19.810> an<00:06:20.170> ounce<00:06:21.010> every

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
hops I'm just adding uh an ounce every

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.520 
hops I'm just adding uh an ounce every
15<00:06:22.000> minutes<00:06:22.390> till<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:22.750> end<00:06:22.870> of<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.340> boil<00:06:24.340> so

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
15 minutes till the end of the boil so

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.370 
15 minutes till the end of the boil so
you<00:06:26.530> have<00:06:26.710> 1<00:06:26.920> ounce<00:06:27.070> in<00:06:28.950> just<00:06:29.950> before<00:06:30.340> boiling

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
you have 1 ounce in just before boiling

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
you have 1 ounce in just before boiling
and<00:06:32.380> then<00:06:32.860> we<00:06:32.950> have<00:06:33.160> other<00:06:33.730> ounce<00:06:33.970> now<00:06:34.410> 15<00:06:38.400> all

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
and then we have other ounce now 15 all

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:52.580 
and then we have other ounce now 15 all
right<00:06:39.550> so<00:06:39.850> here's<00:06:40.150> a<00:06:42.720> third<00:06:43.720> hop<00:06:44.050> addition<00:06:50.910> and

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
right so here's a third hop addition and

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.160 
right so here's a third hop addition and
go<00:06:53.590> ahead<00:06:53.800> and<00:06:53.920> add<00:06:53.980> in<00:06:54.160> my<00:06:54.750> immersion<00:06:55.750> chiller

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.170 
go ahead and add in my immersion chiller

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:05.810 
go ahead and add in my immersion chiller
now<00:06:56.380> so

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820
