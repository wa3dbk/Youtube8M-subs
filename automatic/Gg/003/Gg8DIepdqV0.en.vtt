00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
hey guys welcome to our next tutorial in

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.220 
hey guys welcome to our next tutorial in
which<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:13.920> hopefully<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.429> cover<00:00:14.670> an<00:00:15.599> armed

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
which I'm hopefully gonna cover an armed

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.590 
which I'm hopefully gonna cover an armed
now<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:17.070> proving<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> little<00:00:17.520> difficult<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
now it's proving a little difficult to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470 
now it's proving a little difficult to
demonstrate<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.119> some<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> perks

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
demonstrate this and some of the perks

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720 
demonstrate this and some of the perks
aren't<00:00:21.750> even<00:00:21.930> listed<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> wiki<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.550> from

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
aren't even listed on the wiki but from

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.839 
aren't even listed on the wiki but from
what<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> understand<00:00:24.590> there's<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:26.430> active

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what I understand there's one active

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.990 
what I understand there's one active
ability<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.390> three<00:00:27.689> passive<00:00:28.170> abilities<00:00:29.000> now

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
ability and three passive abilities now

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
ability and three passive abilities now
the<00:00:30.060> passive<00:00:30.539> abilities<00:00:30.929> which<00:00:31.050> I'll<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.289> over

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the passive abilities which I'll go over

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
the passive abilities which I'll go over
first<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> obviously<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:32.820> have

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
first of all obviously you don't have

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
first of all obviously you don't have
any<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.530> don't<00:00:34.739> activate<00:00:35.160> them

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
any you know you don't activate them

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
any you know you don't activate them
they<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.460> either<00:00:36.120> work<00:00:36.360> or<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.630> don't<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
they just either work or they don't and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
they just either work or they don't and
the<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.579> disarm<00:00:39.180> which<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the first one is a disarm which I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.970 
the first one is a disarm which I
believe<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> chance<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.469> disarm<00:00:40.829> your

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
believe is a chance to disarm your

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
believe is a chance to disarm your
opponent<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.629> too<00:00:42.780> sure<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:42.989> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
opponent now I'm not too sure how that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.810 
opponent now I'm not too sure how that
will<00:00:43.440> work<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.040> server<00:00:44.280> because

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
will work on this server because

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
will work on this server because
obviously<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:45.539> new<00:00:45.690> PvP<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> may

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
obviously there's new PvP but it may

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430 
obviously there's new PvP but it may
apply<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> skeletons<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.930> haven't<00:00:49.230> been

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
apply to skeletons but I haven't been

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
apply to skeletons but I haven't been
able<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> produce<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.270> yet<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> would

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
able to produce it yet but it would

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.069 
able to produce it yet but it would
imply<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:53.640> PvP<00:00:54.239> combat<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
imply that in PvP combat you have the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.029 
imply that in PvP combat you have the
chance<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.579> remove<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:57.109> take<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.350> steal<00:00:58.770> your

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
chance to remove or take or steal your

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.389 
chance to remove or take or steal your
opponent's<00:01:00.030> weapon<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
opponent's weapon so that's one of the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.390 
opponent's weapon so that's one of the
passive<00:01:02.699> abilities<00:01:03.140> another<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> iron

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
passive abilities another one is iron

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
passive abilities another one is iron
arm<00:01:05.700> star<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.510> believe<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
arm star which I believe is just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
arm star which I believe is just
basically<00:01:08.420> as<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.900> level<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.760> more

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
basically as you level up you do more

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
basically as you level up you do more
damage

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
damage

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
damage
I<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:13.320> example<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:13.860> I've<00:01:14.010> artificially

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I for example now I've artificially

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.130 
I for example now I've artificially
inflated<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.270> level<00:01:15.570> 2<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:17.369> 400<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
inflated my level 2 to 400 and there's a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
inflated my level 2 to 400 and there's a
reason<00:01:19.470> why<00:01:19.590> I've<00:01:19.740> set<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> 400<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.790> I'll

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
reason why I've set it to 400 which I'll

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.590 
reason why I've set it to 400 which I'll
cover<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> moment<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.390> right<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
cover in a moment and but right now I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.550 
cover in a moment and but right now I
can<00:01:26.270> kill<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.869> zombies<00:01:28.290> skeletons

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
can kill and you know zombies skeletons

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
can kill and you know zombies skeletons
creepers<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.430> 3<00:01:29.790> hits

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
creepers with 3 hits

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.450 
creepers with 3 hits
with<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:31.020> fists<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:32.159> obviously

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
with just my fists which obviously

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.870 
with just my fists which obviously
normally<00:01:32.939> takes<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.479> 10<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.079> 20<00:01:34.350> hits<00:01:34.880> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
normally takes like 10 to 20 hits so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
normally takes like 10 to 20 hits so
that's<00:01:36.060> pretty<00:01:36.270> cool<00:01:36.619> I've<00:01:37.619> built<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.920> little

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that's pretty cool I've built a little

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.260 
that's pretty cool I've built a little
room<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.640> hoping<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.210> gonna

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
room here I'm hoping that there's gonna

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.749 
room here I'm hoping that there's gonna
be<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.479> mobs<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> looks<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.439> are

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
be some mobs that looks like there are

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.460 
be some mobs that looks like there are
so<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.000> hopefully<00:01:42.390> demonstrate<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so I can hopefully demonstrate it and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.219 
so I can hopefully demonstrate it and
probably<00:01:43.680> die<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.540> other<00:01:45.720> passive

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
probably die but the other passive

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
probably die but the other passive
ability<00:01:46.649> before<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> active

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
ability before we go over the active

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.130 
ability before we go over the active
ability<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:49.310> arrow<00:01:50.310> deflect<00:01:51.240> which<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.990> think

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
ability is arrow deflect which I think

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
ability is arrow deflect which I think
speaks<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.530> itself<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.130> level<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
speaks for itself as you level up you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
speaks for itself as you level up you
gain<00:01:54.299> an<00:01:54.930> increased<00:01:55.350> chance<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.369> take

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
gain an increased chance to not take

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.580 
gain an increased chance to not take
damage<00:01:56.850> from

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
damage from

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.630 
damage from
arrows<00:01:59.670> quite<00:01:59.970> simply<00:02:02.090> zombie<00:02:03.090> carry<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> yeah

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
arrows quite simply zombie carry so yeah

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
arrows quite simply zombie carry so yeah
we're<00:02:05.790> gonna<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.570> my<00:02:06.720> little<00:02:06.899> hat

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
we're gonna go into out my little hat

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.490 
we're gonna go into out my little hat
here<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:07.979> sure<00:02:08.899> how<00:02:09.899> many<00:02:09.959> mobs<00:02:10.349> are

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
here now I'm not sure how many mobs are

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440 
here now I'm not sure how many mobs are
gonna<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.130> could<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.940> few<00:02:12.330> too

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
gonna be in there could be a few too

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930 
gonna be in there could be a few too
many<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.260> I'm<00:02:13.319> gonna<00:02:13.470> try<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.940> demonstrate

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
many but I'm gonna try and demonstrate

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.360 
many but I'm gonna try and demonstrate

sorry which is called berserk and you

sorry which is called berserk and you

activate it as with everything by

activate it as with everything by

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
armed you'll see the duration that it
lasts<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.650> my<00:02:28.769> berserk<00:02:29.069> length<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.489> ten

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
lasts for so my berserk length is ten

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.080 
lasts for so my berserk length is ten
seconds<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:31.290> believe<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.890> goes<00:02:31.980> up<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.250> 22<00:02:32.850> if

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
seconds I believe it goes up to 22 if

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.170 
seconds I believe it goes up to 22 if
you<00:02:33.450> were<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.600> level<00:02:34.049> 1000<00:02:34.769> oh<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.940> actually

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
you were a level 1000 oh it actually

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.000 
you were a level 1000 oh it actually
covers<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> abilities<00:02:37.049> here<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> little<00:02:37.530> bit

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.559 

you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.310> he<00:02:41.430> goes<00:02:41.910> over<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.269> fact<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
you know so he goes over the fact that

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.610 
you know so he goes over the fact that
berserk<00:02:42.810> does<00:02:43.230> plus<00:02:43.560> 50<00:02:43.920> damage<00:02:45.620> disarmed

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
berserk does plus 50 damage disarmed

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
berserk does plus 50 damage disarmed
drops<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.160> foes<00:02:47.370> item<00:02:47.880> held<00:02:48.269> in<00:02:48.420> hand<00:02:48.599> as<00:02:48.720> we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
drops the foes item held in hand as we

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.160 
drops the foes item held in hand as we
covered<00:02:49.730> iron<00:02:50.730> arm<00:02:50.970> style<00:02:51.269> hardens<00:02:51.780> your<00:02:51.989> arm

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
covered iron arm style hardens your arm

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.380 
covered iron arm style hardens your arm
over<00:02:52.440> time<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.890> think<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.280> just<00:02:53.310> does<00:02:54.239> more

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
over time so I think that just does more

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.449 
over time so I think that just does more
damage<00:02:54.420> quite<00:02:54.959> simply<00:02:55.290> arrow<00:02:55.830> deflect

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
damage quite simply arrow deflect

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.570 
damage quite simply arrow deflect
deflect<00:02:56.700> arrow<00:02:57.120> speaks<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.660> itself

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
deflect arrow speaks for itself

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.820 
deflect arrow speaks for itself
so<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.790> have<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.269> 20%<00:03:00.599> arrow<00:03:01.080> deflect<00:03:01.560> chance

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
so we have a 20% arrow deflect chance

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.390 
so we have a 20% arrow deflect chance
and<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.700> 30%<00:03:03.060> disarm<00:03:03.959> chance<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.859> as<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.130> say<00:03:05.280> I'm

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
and a 30% disarm chance but as I say I'm

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.009 
and a 30% disarm chance but as I say I'm
not<00:03:05.579> sure<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:05.880> useful<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.299> will<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.690> without

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
not sure how useful that will be without

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.410 
not sure how useful that will be without
PvP<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.250> I'm<00:03:08.370> gonna<00:03:08.549> go<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.209> try<00:03:09.390> and

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
your fists then you can obviously use

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
that ability so that's pretty much

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
level 400 my fists do four and a half

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.580

hearts<00:04:42.400> damage<00:04:42.990> which<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.139> why<00:04:44.260> it<00:04:44.320> takes

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
hearts damage which is why it takes

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.140 
hearts damage which is why it takes
three<00:04:44.889> hits<00:04:45.130> because<00:04:45.340> obviously<00:04:45.610> two<00:04:45.940> hits

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
three hits because obviously two hits

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.689 
three hits because obviously two hits
would<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:46.419> nine<00:04:46.599> hearts<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:48.070> final<00:04:48.490> hit

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699
