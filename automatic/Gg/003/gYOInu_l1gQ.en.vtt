demo<00:01:11.789> here<00:01:14.840> trick<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.959> getting<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.259> dumbbell

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
demo here trick to getting that dumbbell

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.520 
demo here trick to getting that dumbbell
into<00:01:16.800> position<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.819> first<00:01:18.319> get<00:01:19.319> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
into position it's first get that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.240 
into position it's first get that
resting<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.069> the<00:01:20.130> leg<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.099> arm

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
resting from the leg then it's your arm

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.440 
resting from the leg then it's your arm
hooked<00:01:23.490> underneath<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.539> like<00:01:25.050> bed<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.800> then

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
hooked underneath that like bed and then

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.070 
hooked underneath that like bed and then
simply<00:01:27.450> better<00:01:27.890> get<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.300> like<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
simply better get it right here like so

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.810 
simply better get it right here like so
it's<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> matter<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.800> pressing<00:01:32.250> up

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it's just a matter of pressing up

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090 
it's just a matter of pressing up
directly<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:34.200> shoulders<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.650> tilted<00:01:34.950> down

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
directly your shoulders are tilted down

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
directly your shoulders are tilted down
so<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.700> basically<00:01:36.510> your<00:01:36.660> body<00:01:36.810> positioning

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so the basically your body positioning

00:01:37.290 --> 00:02:22.099 
so the basically your body positioning
is<00:01:37.410> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> do

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.470 

so<00:02:23.109> go<00:02:23.439> back<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.859> like<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.239> get<00:02:28.359> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
so go back and you like and you get to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.039 
so go back and you like and you get to
you<00:02:29.249> now<00:02:30.249> obviously<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.510> want<00:02:31.629> to<00:02:31.659> bounce<00:02:31.840> up

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
you now obviously you want to bounce up

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.410 
you now obviously you want to bounce up
your<00:02:32.609> training<00:02:33.609> here<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:33.969> I'm<00:02:34.090> gonna<00:02:34.180> switch

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
your training here so I'm gonna switch

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.149 
your training here so I'm gonna switch
over<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.719> do<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.049> other<00:02:35.079> side<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.469> well<00:02:35.530> I'll

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
over and do the other side as well I'll

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.920 
over and do the other side as well I'll
try<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.459> do<00:02:36.579> from<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.819> back<00:02:36.939> here<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.389> we<00:02:37.840> can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
try to do from the back here so we can

00:02:37.930 --> 00:03:29.479 
try to do from the back here so we can
see<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> different<00:02:38.560> angle

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.179 

one<00:03:30.000> important<00:03:30.359> thing<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.480> note<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:30.840> that
