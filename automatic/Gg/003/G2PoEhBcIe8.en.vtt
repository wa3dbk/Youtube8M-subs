00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:24.320 

maybe<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:05.050> could<00:02:05.440> do<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.410

used<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.010> void<00:02:43.280> though<00:02:43.580> remember<00:02:45.580> he

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
used to be the void though remember he

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.830 
used to be the void though remember he
used<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.880> be<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.300> huge<00:02:47.780> canvas<00:02:49.540> blank

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.500 

ready<00:02:53.840> for<00:02:54.110> us<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.410> make<00:02:55.100> our<00:02:55.280> mark<00:02:55.519> on<00:02:55.670> it

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.000 

maybe<00:03:01.720> maybe<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.840> should<00:03:03.080> just<00:03:03.290> let<00:03:03.500> pilots

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
maybe maybe I should just let pilots

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:21.290 
maybe maybe I should just let pilots
Federation<00:03:04.580> just<00:03:05.269> take<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.690> ship<00:03:05.930> after<00:03:06.319> all

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.400 

I<00:03:23.060> caught<00:03:24.060> my<00:03:24.180> reflection<00:03:24.210> today<00:03:24.870> before<00:03:25.380> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
I caught my reflection today before I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.550 
I caught my reflection today before I
got<00:03:25.590> my<00:03:25.800> helmet<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:27.110> haven't<00:03:28.110> seen<00:03:28.290> my<00:03:28.410> own

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:47.000 
got my helmet on I haven't seen my own
faces<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.160> got<00:03:29.310> discharged<00:03:29.910> from<00:03:30.030> medical

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.740 

you<00:03:48.540> wouldn't<00:03:49.540> recognize<00:03:49.690> me<00:03:50.019> anymore

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you wouldn't recognize me anymore

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.650 
you wouldn't recognize me anymore
hell<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:53.110> don't<00:03:53.620> recognize<00:03:54.040> me<00:03:54.250> anymore

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.300 

maybe<00:03:57.290> that's<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.890> best<00:04:00.310> pylos

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
maybe that's for the best pylos

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.400 
maybe that's for the best pylos
federation<00:04:01.880> assurance<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.450> usually<00:04:03.200> pretty

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
federation assurance is usually pretty

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.090 
federation assurance is usually pretty
good<00:04:05.440> but<00:04:06.440> i<00:04:06.470> guess<00:04:07.240> they<00:04:08.240> don't<00:04:08.390> cover

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
good but i guess they don't cover

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.580 
good but i guess they don't cover
cosmetic<00:04:10.100> reconstructive<00:04:11.030> surgery<00:04:11.960> or

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
cosmetic reconstructive surgery or

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.680 
cosmetic reconstructive surgery or
harmless<00:04:13.310> rated<00:04:13.820> pilots<00:04:16.120> no<00:04:17.120> one<00:04:17.300> seems<00:04:17.570> to

harmless rated pilots no one seems to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.640 
harmless rated pilots no one seems to
know<00:04:18.140> who<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.410> am
