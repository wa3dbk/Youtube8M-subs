record<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> HDMI<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.640> only<00:00:47.760> record<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
record off of HDMI it can only record a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
record off of HDMI it can only record a
signal<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.870> coming<00:00:49.289> through<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.649> HDMI

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
signal it's coming through the HDMI

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
signal it's coming through the HDMI
cable<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.230> coming<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
cable so if it's not coming through the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.610 
cable so if it's not coming through the
HDMI<00:00:52.920> cable<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> catch<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
HDMI cable it's not going to catch it

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.260 
HDMI cable it's not going to catch it
that<00:00:55.620> means<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> plug<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.820> mic<00:00:57.030> into

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that means when you plug your mic into

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.979 
that means when you plug your mic into
your<00:00:57.570> controller<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:59.010> chat<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.239> coming<00:01:00.809> from

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
your controller all chat is coming from

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
your controller all chat is coming from
the<00:01:01.140> controller<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.920> no<00:01:02.039> longing<00:01:02.280> cut<00:01:02.640> no

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the controller it's no longing cut no

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.910 
the controller it's no longing cut no
longer<00:01:03.210> coming<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> HDMI<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.619> why

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
longer coming from the HDMI that's why

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
longer coming from the HDMI that's why
your<00:01:05.220> capture<00:01:05.580> card<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.119> picking<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> up

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
your capture card is not picking it up

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.289 
your capture card is not picking it up
so<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> means<00:01:07.770> since<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.640> controller<00:01:09.030> now

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so that means since your controller now

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
so that means since your controller now
is<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> audio<00:01:09.960> source<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.530> chat<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.250> to

I'll<00:04:46.240> cover<00:04:46.389> that<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:46.750> detail<00:04:46.780> in<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.500> later
