00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.110
 it's something that some are special and that 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.709
 many find themselves without pursuing 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.830
 you ask me when the 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.160
 glory that becomes unfair 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.029
 cross to the middle that justifying that 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.460
 consume even is completely everything has 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.259
 its end as the beat of this base or is the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.509
 citizen that you turn on when leaving 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.910
 class life ends like these 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.520
 compasses I am the point and followed that 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.430
 close this sentence like the photos you are going 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.860
 hoping to see you I woke up just by much 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.380
 it sounds like everything is over and there's no 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.960
 I want to please you I come to the end already 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.570
 nobody denies an inert sun I have seen the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.970
 death closely with my eyes the primer 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.700
 from my bank in 'red numbers' the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.920
 batons hitting in each eviction the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.590
 world dies and they leave us with the spoils 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.810
 that's why I write out of the corner of my eye while you arrive 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.300
 because they do not always get what you 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.970
 deliveries waiting for the lethal change of 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.280
 the tides everything has its end although not 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.259
 Believe it want you to understand what 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.110
 what have you done with me, only the 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.150
 hope that apart from here I swear that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.050
 you are my I do not understand why it has been like this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.510
 throughout 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.640
 because everything has its end I would like 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.070
 you would understand what you have done about me only 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.590
 I have the hope that apart from here 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.500
 I swear you're my not understand why he 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 its end everything has its end even the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.640
 infinite and the tears she shed 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.100
 about this writing I no longer visit my 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.650
 child because there is no heart died 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.080
 because in pieces you broke it 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.300
 be like the cosmos do not stop spinning by 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.880
 More than I want, I'll never stop looking at you 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.890
 I want to rhyme forget about the minute hand and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440
 that the routes of my three never forget the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.050
 passenger, even if it's honest it costs me 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.450
 believe it and but they will be erased my 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.820
 traces of the road and that sediment the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.220
 time everything I think I have friends 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.710

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.990
 gianni skated but skype memories vaart 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.480

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.000
 stark I was never for being up to me 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.870
 sky everything has its end was the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.310
 thaw 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.830
 I want you to understand what you have 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.330
 I understand why it has been so the whole 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.459
 because everything has its end I would like 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 you would understand what you have done about me only 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.690
 here I swear that you are my I do not understand by 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.709

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.709
