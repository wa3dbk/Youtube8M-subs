00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
people can see the coordinates because i

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.490 
people can see the coordinates because i
don't<00:00:30.570> know<00:00:30.630> maybe<00:00:30.840> look<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> description

like right here is what I'm focusing on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.080 
like right here is what I'm focusing on
you<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> nice<00:00:51.809> starting<00:00:52.620> area<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.190> put

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you got a nice starting area you can put

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.549 
you got a nice starting area you can put
like<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.719> wall<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.050> off<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> start

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like you can wall this off and start

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.340 
like you can wall this off and start
this<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> easy<00:00:56.670> farm<00:00:57.090> cuz<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.230> your

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this as a easy farm cuz you got your

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
this as a easy farm cuz you got your
water<00:00:58.469> source<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.370> slowly

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
water source up here then you can slowly

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
water source up here then you can slowly
seal<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> off<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> into<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.230> kind<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
seal it off make this into some kind of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.070 
seal it off make this into some kind of
castle<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.239> giant<00:01:03.239> house<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.719> something<00:01:03.960> like

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
castle or giant house or something like

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
castle or giant house or something like
that<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> top<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.850> you'll<00:01:06.330> have

there's<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.310> more<00:01:47.729> over<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.270> side

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
there's one more over on this side

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
there's one more over on this side
somewhere<00:01:48.780> yep<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.649> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.580 
somewhere yep right there so you have a
nice<00:01:53.040> starting<00:01:53.790> area<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.110> good<00:01:55.290> amount<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
nice starting area and a good amount of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
nice starting area and a good amount of
coal<00:01:55.829> turned<00:01:56.640> into<00:01:56.850> new<00:01:56.969> quarry<00:01:57.329> likes<00:01:57.810> big

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
coal turned into new quarry likes big

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.590 
coal turned into new quarry likes big
down<00:01:58.850> pretty<00:01:59.850> much<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.180> has<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
down pretty much this has a lot of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
down pretty much this has a lot of
possibilities<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
possibilities which I like about this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.780 
possibilities which I like about this
seed<00:02:03.049> make<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> bridge<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.619> across<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:05.310> get

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
seed make a bridge going across here get

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
seed make a bridge going across here get
a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> possibilities<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> seed<00:02:07.110> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a lot of possibilities with the seed so

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.690 
a lot of possibilities with the seed so
that's<00:02:07.380> basically<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.220> seed<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.610> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that's basically it for the seed if you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.680 
that's basically it for the seed if you
like<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> seed

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
like the seed

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
like the seed
give<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:11.690> there's<00:02:12.690> still<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> pole<00:02:13.500> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
give it a like there's still the pole in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
give it a like there's still the pole in
the<00:02:13.920> bottom<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.970> haven't<00:02:15.150> voted

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the bottom so if you haven't voted

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.260 
the bottom so if you haven't voted
already<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> bottom<00:02:17.820> by<00:02:17.970> me<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.210> the
