breathing yeah and so he started turning
bright<00:01:40.930> blue<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.500> can<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.799> see<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.130> just

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
bright blue and I can just see it I just

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.280 
bright blue and I can just see it I just
felt<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.939> room<00:01:43.149> like<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.869> doctor

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
felt it in the room like the doctor

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.749 
felt it in the room like the doctor
started<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.649> panic<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:45.130> little<00:01:45.280> bit

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
started to panic a little bit

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.880 
started to panic a little bit
and<00:01:45.850> so<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.750> was<00:01:46.990> like<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.170> weird<00:01:47.439> feeling<00:01:47.740> I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
and so it was like a weird feeling I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.990 
and so it was like a weird feeling I
didn't<00:01:48.130> know<00:01:48.189> what<00:01:48.280> was<00:01:48.369> going<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.759> and
