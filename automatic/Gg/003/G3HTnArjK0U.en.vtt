00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.820
 hello everyone to gamecube 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.680
 this little purple cube with flu tunes 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 in high tech has extraordinary power 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.490
 to bring me back in time at each 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.140
 once I touch his controller 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.599
 indeed the gamecube is for me the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 symbol of a hectic adolescence 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.769
 tugged between my California punch my 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 skate and daylight one side and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 my gamecube that made me lock myself 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 for hours to dose a few 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.150
 games alone or with several of the other and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.950
 it must be said that if I had not had the 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.670
 gamecube to cheer me up after 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.200
 the death of the dreamcast 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.210
 I probably would not have games 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.010
 video today is so you do not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 could not enjoy this magnificent top 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.980
 6 games that I briskly dare 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:04.019
 on gamecube and why if this number 6 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.790
 goldeneye at the service of evil hop hop hop 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.009
 hop hop do not leave immediately I 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 know that the game has often been criticized 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.969
 even smashed everywhere and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.159
 overall I tend to agree 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.020
 the solo is not terrible and he has no 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 goldeneye that name but at the time I 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 I was somewhat interested in 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.579
 multiplayer and I have to tell you he 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.049
 is extremely fun 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.090
 frankly it's one of my best 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.770
 multi player memories of all time 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.420
 I still remember the match debts 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 frenzied 4 players in the maps 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.899
 tiny of the game and the time I believe 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.939
 that we had launched that game in the evening 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.590
 for over a year and if no one 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.659
 had brought him back and we were playing everything 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.249
 just not the console that's where 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.569
 we recognize a good multiplayer mode 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.759
 it's when no one wants to play anymore 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.380
 to something else in summary it's a bit 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.179
 late but golden eye at the service of evil 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.619
 would have deserved attention 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.999
 closer just for its mode 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.600
 ultra fun multiplayer 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:53.759
 too bad for you number 5 need for 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 speed underground of I know the series 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.990
 need for speed since episode iii 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.549
 on pc and I'm interested in it 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 it's one of the first 3D games in which 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.240
 I played this nfs 3 and I must say that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.979
 the arrival of the series on 128 bits 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 had made me want to 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.580
 the time until I make 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.259
 that there were no races 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.270
 lawsuits and that it was a city 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.440
 open but with the second episode of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.220
 the underground series 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.510
 I admit to having really fallen 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 in I 'm not especially a 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.470
 jacky tuning fans who listen to the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.030
 thoroughly mapped but sunderland 2 had 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.500
 a little something winne ten 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.480
 in him I remember having spent a 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.580
 countless hours to choose 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.470
 the right stickers the right color the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 good neon short I change little to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.740
 little in mid mi jacky mi hybrid and I 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.420
 believe that I stopped when I 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.280
 started getting my jog in my 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.360
 socks all this was going a lot 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.590
 too far number 4 you have to know that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.490
 the base I'm not very fan of the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.290
 mario kart series 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.780
 I always found them a bit soft 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.080
 a bit slow but with mario double kart 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.860
 dash 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.860
 I had the good surprise 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.430
 the game is so fast I mean 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.390
 it's amazing as still 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.770
 today this game can be 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.970
 completely speed 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.530
 I remember comparing with 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.890
 mario kart wii during the release of this 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.930
 latest 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.060
 and what's that mario kart wii 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.380
 is slow compared to double dash and then 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.000
 there is the dual pilot system that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.830
 I always loved being able to 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.540
 storing a weapon in reserve changes everything 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.280
 the dynamics of the game and it is not uncommon 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.020
 trapping his opponent relaxes 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.120
 after dodging your green carapace 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.100
 by surprising him with a gaggle of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.390
 short round shell one of the only mario 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.250
 kart that I returned in all 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.250
 meaning until the title screen changes 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.150
 number 3 here it's a bit of a case 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.710
 especially I did not play there 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.690
 the time because the game never went out 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.580
 from japan but this is the typical example of 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.590
 why I like to make videos on 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.660
 internet in my top 6 on games 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.370
 concept that tears his race that you 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.140
 can find by clicking on this big 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.150
 zizis very low gesture eyes I have you 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.890
 talked about culo colo-colo line and I 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.780
 evoked these sequel to which I had not 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.790
 never tried the envi then took me 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.110
 to try the episode gamecube in me 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.810
 wondering how he could 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.880
 improve the recipe in curling splash 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.890
 the rules remain the same but each 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.810
 level will bring you its own power 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 up that you will need to use for 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.950
 evolve in the levels of mere 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.470
 hill game puzzle becomes a superb 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.330
 super fun arcade game with music 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.680
 very nice and even late bosses 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.390
 level and it's nice to see a 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.419
 team carry their concept knowing 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.640
 that they are no longer bridled because 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.930
 it's subscribers knowing that they are not 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.330
 more blocked by the limitation 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.100
 technical of a portable console in brief 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.050
 I highly recommend Claudine 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.640
 splash one of the best arcade games of 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.320
 the gamecube that does not absolutely require 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.150
 not understand the Japanese to play 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.050
 by the way no no do not thank me 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.000
 I do this for apa fillon the pavilion 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.190
 number two this is the third time that 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.110
 this game landed in a top 6 and I 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.000
 say again it's deserved for the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.080
 little reminder wind waker was very bad 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.580
 welcomed on its way out 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.260
 it did not feel too much in 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.790
 europe and especially in france because we 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.350
 is used to screaming at genius as soon as 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.730
 it comes from Japan but when 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.770
 even some friends who were very 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.990
 disappointed with the new zelda design and 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.820
 believe me in terms of disappointment with 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.490
 a redesign I can very well 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.940
 understand 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.770
 but I 'm getting our brains out 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.870
 never stop friend 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.430
 it's been three times that I'm committing suicide 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.009
 my channel I think my subconscious 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.569
 try to tell me something but 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.370
 my side, on the contrary, I was very 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.990
 attracted by this shedding just like you 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.819
 have seen in my top 6 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.349
 7 shedding that stinks the class you 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.509
 can find by clicking on the 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.310
 wholesaler what has happened 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.449
 with my super if you are all click 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.660
 above without washing your hands but 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.340
 that's when number 1 is first at 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.919
 ranking of the games I have to negro man 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.280
 2 and on game gamecube to equality 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.259
 perfect teigneux underground 1 and 2 and 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.720
 wii subtitled the underground games 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.319
 it was fashionable at the time and it's 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.659
 sad 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.639
 to be clear I never let go 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.169
 tony hawk series and this since I have 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.180
 hit the first episode on the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.800
 playstation a buddy and even though this 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.930
 story begins as a top and glock 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.360
 of doctissimo 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.110
 I was at a friend's house and we play at the 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.180
 playstation 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.740
 know that it ends well because 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.409
 when the series performed a they 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.970
 flip 360 and well I followed it 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.740
 know that my environment of the time 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.320
 consist essentially of sweaters 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.940
 hooded skaters shoes and 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.979
 good big express families 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.419
 good little has changed since in 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.400
 did but quentin I propose to 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.050
 become a secretary a professional 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.430
 what's more and all starting from 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.900
 nothing and going for sponsors 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.610
 visit a whole bunch of cities and 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.590
 participate in championships 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.199
 trust me that the verdict is final 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.449
 over 400 hours of play on the clock 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.919
 nothing but the first game without counting 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.599
 the multiplayer mode that got us a lot 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.979
 served my mates because none 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.400
 of us did not really know how to make 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.930
 skate 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.520
 I also liked the second 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.440
 episode even though I still have a 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.389
 preference for the first one that benefits 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.610
 better better level ost 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.650
 and a really funny scenario oh and 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.819
 then there is the hawaii spot that one 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.819
 jump over the chopper 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.430
 the funny thing is that even after 10 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.620
 years without touching this game I retried 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.720
 the experience there is little and I got 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.400
 exploded as before and that's where we 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.750
 recognizes the games that made the 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.700
 player we are today 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.680
 thank you all for having followed this top
