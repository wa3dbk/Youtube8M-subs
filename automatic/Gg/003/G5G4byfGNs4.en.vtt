00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
here and this is the only one that I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
here and this is the only one that I
need<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:05.970> replaced<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> case<00:01:07.920> you

need to get replaced just a case you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
need to get replaced just a case you
guys<00:01:08.220> were<00:01:08.430> wondering<00:01:09.110> when<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> gutted<00:01:11.070> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
guys were wondering when you gutted your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
guys were wondering when you gutted your
Mac<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.979> power

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
Mac out what this is that is a power

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
Mac out what this is that is a power
inverter<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.869> hooked<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
inverter that is hooked to this and it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
inverter that is hooked to this and it
provides<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> backlight<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> lighting

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
provides the backlight and the lighting

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
provides the backlight and the lighting
for<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.060> LCD<00:01:25.369> panel<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:26.939> display<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.659> was

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
for your LCD panel or your display I was

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
for your LCD panel or your display I was
just<00:01:28.530> curious<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> looked<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.850> open<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
just curious so I looked it up I open it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.710 
just curious so I looked it up I open it
up<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> turn<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.780> around<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.460> got<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.720> code

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
up and turn it around and got the code

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
up and turn it around and got the code
Sorrell<00:01:34.200> members<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.220> that's<00:01:35.880> what

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
Sorrell members off of it so that's what

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
Sorrell members off of it so that's what
that<00:01:36.119> does<00:01:36.450> sometimes<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.650> guess<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.100> needs

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that does sometimes I guess that needs

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
that does sometimes I guess that needs
to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> replaced<00:01:38.850> too<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.360> -<00:01:39.780> seems<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to be replaced too but - seems to be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.539 
to be replaced too but - seems to be
fine<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:42.180> heads<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.430> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
fine so just a heads up one thing I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.580 
fine so just a heads up one thing I
wanted<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> stress<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.840> everyone<00:01:46.380> listening

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
wanted to stress to everyone listening

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.520 
wanted to stress to everyone listening
them<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.939> gonna<00:01:48.090> take<00:01:48.649> some<00:01:49.649> real

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
them it's gonna take some real

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.480 
them it's gonna take some real
perseverance<00:01:52.530> motivation<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.340> dedication

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
haven't ever done it and you're doing it

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
haven't ever done it and you're doing it
for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> first<00:01:59.369> time<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.820> accurst<00:02:00.240> may<00:02:00.360> have

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
for the first time I accurst may have

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.920 
for the first time I accurst may have
already<00:02:00.659> taken<00:02:00.960> apart<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:02.189> Mac<00:02:02.630> three<00:02:03.630> times

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
already taken apart my Mac three times

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.340 
already taken apart my Mac three times
but<00:02:04.799> before<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> first<00:02:05.610> time<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.119> had<00:02:06.869> no<00:02:07.170> idea

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
but before the first time I had no idea

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.580 
but before the first time I had no idea
what<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.799> doing<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.450> carefully

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
what I was doing so I carefully

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.000 
what I was doing so I carefully
disassembled<00:02:10.590> everything<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.610> just

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
disassembled everything and just

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.530

kind<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.250> made<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> mental<00:02:12.700> note<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.060> some<00:02:13.420> of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
kind of made a mental note and some of

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.199 
kind of made a mental note and some of
it<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.720> even<00:02:14.129> drew<00:02:15.129> up<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> schematic<00:02:16.000> but

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
it I even drew up on a schematic but

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.380 
it I even drew up on a schematic but
putting<00:02:17.140> all<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.409> stuff<00:02:17.470> together<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:19.330> just

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.030 
kind of want to have patience and when
it<00:02:21.970> comes<00:02:22.060> time<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.390> actually<00:02:22.799> put<00:02:24.450> it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
it comes time to actually put it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160 
it comes time to actually put it
together<00:02:27.040> again<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.909> so<00:02:28.330> just<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.750> case<00:02:28.900> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
together again and so just in case you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.350 
together again and so just in case you
have<00:02:29.530> all<00:02:29.830> them<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.790> know<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.209> have

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
have all them so you know that you have

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.820 
have all them so you know that you have
all<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> screws<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.260> everything<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.650> needs

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
all the screws and everything that needs

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.550 
all the screws and everything that needs
to<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:34.480> course<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:35.049> always<00:02:35.319> good

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
to go in it of course it's always good

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.170 
to go in it of course it's always good
practice<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.099> keep<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.400> screws<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.819> go<00:02:36.879> with

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
practice to keep the screws that go with

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.059 
practice to keep the screws that go with
that<00:02:37.209> particular<00:02:37.780> piece<00:02:38.379> of<00:02:38.440> hardware<00:02:38.829> with

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
that particular piece of hardware with

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.630 
that particular piece of hardware with
it<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.489> take<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:40.329> here<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.079> you<00:02:41.349> need<00:02:41.799> some

it I take it on here but you need some

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.509 
it I take it on here but you need some
patience<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:43.870> able<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.110> get<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.769> end<00:02:45.430> of

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
patience to be able to get to the end of

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.449 
patience to be able to get to the end of
this<00:02:45.610> project<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.470> if<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.220> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
little update I went ahead and turned on

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.089 
little update I went ahead and turned on
my<00:03:02.440> Mac<00:03:03.099> from<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.810> behind<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.829> actual

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
my Mac from the behind on the actual

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.190 
my Mac from the behind on the actual
turn<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.459> screen<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.870> let<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.170> know

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
turn on screen and just let you know

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.920 
turn on screen and just let you know
it's<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:09.670> spreading<00:03:10.060> slowly<00:03:10.329> really

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
it's just it's spreading slowly really

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.890 
it's just it's spreading slowly really
nice<00:03:13.590> seems<00:03:14.590> like<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.829> CPU<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.549> really<00:03:16.000> making

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
nice seems like the CPU is really making

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.430 
nice seems like the CPU is really making
things<00:03:17.049> work<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.440> only<00:03:17.709> drawback<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:19.440> if

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
things work the only drawback is is if

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.949 
things work the only drawback is is if
you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.709> see<00:03:20.919> these<00:03:21.190> pics<00:03:22.000> elations<00:03:22.510> within

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
you can see these pics elations within

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.870 
you can see these pics elations within
all<00:03:23.109> these<00:03:23.260> icons<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.040> even<00:03:24.519> within<00:03:24.669> the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
all these icons and even within the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.770 
all these icons and even within the
mouse<00:03:25.090> there<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.810> think<00:03:26.530> we're<00:03:26.950> having<00:03:27.130> some

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
mouse there I think we're having some

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.099 
mouse there I think we're having some
graphics<00:03:28.780> board<00:03:28.959> issues<00:03:30.569> however<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.959> is

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
graphics board issues however it is

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.699 
graphics board issues however it is
working<00:03:32.739> really<00:03:32.950> good<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:34.590> I'm<00:03:35.590> gonna

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
working really good and I'm gonna

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.620 
working really good and I'm gonna
actually<00:03:36.069> pop<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.489> DVD<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:37.150> show<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
actually pop in a DVD and show you a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.240 
actually pop in a DVD and show you a
little<00:03:37.780> bit<00:03:37.930> more<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.380> what's<00:03:38.560> going<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:38.889> at

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
little bit more of what's going on at

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.809 
little bit more of what's going on at
the<00:03:39.400> actual<00:03:39.760> graphics<00:03:40.650> okay<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.489> actually

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
the actual graphics okay so I actually

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.449 
the actual graphics okay so I actually
put<00:03:43.209> in<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:43.709> DVD<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.769> can<00:03:47.950> look<00:03:48.099> close

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
put in a DVD and if you can look close

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.659 
put in a DVD and if you can look close
up<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:49.030> can<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.389> all<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.310> pixel<00:03:51.310> degradation

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
up you can see all the pixel degradation

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.990 
up you can see all the pixel degradation
on<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.269> actual<00:03:54.690> graphics<00:03:55.690> here<00:03:55.959> and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
on the actual graphics here and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.050 
on the actual graphics here and
go<00:03:57.480> ahead<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.990> play<00:03:58.200> something<00:03:58.710> here<00:03:59.610> just<00:03:59.910> to

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
go ahead and play something here just to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.830 
go ahead and play something here just to
kind<00:04:00.270> of<00:04:01.340> show<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.400> how<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.180> looks<00:04:03.210> when<00:04:03.690> it's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
kind of show you how it looks when it's

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.770 
kind of show you how it looks when it's
actually<00:04:04.020> running<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:08.130> DVD<00:04:08.580> 22<00:04:09.210> episodes<00:04:09.660> of

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
actually running the DVD 22 episodes of

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.440 
actually running the DVD 22 episodes of
intelligence<00:04:10.290> 7<00:04:10.740> which<00:04:11.250> means<00:04:11.550> there's<00:04:12.270> no

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
intelligence 7 which means there's no

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.140 
intelligence 7 which means there's no
trend<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.870> 1<00:04:13.020> there's<00:04:13.770> no<00:04:13.950> fat<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.850> whole

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
trend and 1 there's no fat to the whole

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.460 
trend and 1 there's no fat to the whole
thing<00:04:15.510> everything<00:04:16.019> moves<00:04:16.760> depositor<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
thing everything moves depositor and

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.190 
thing everything moves depositor and
anyway<00:04:19.470> that's<00:04:19.829> why<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.010> think<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.600> graphs<00:04:21.810> car

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
anyway that's why I think the graphs car

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.980 
anyway that's why I think the graphs car
is<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.620> little<00:04:22.860> bit<00:04:23.010> degraded<00:04:23.910> here<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.930> know

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
is a little bit degraded here you know

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.380 
is a little bit degraded here you know
I'm<00:04:25.140> gonna<00:04:25.230> go<00:04:25.410> ahead<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.950> kind<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.000> close<00:04:27.180> out

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
I'm gonna go ahead and kind of close out

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.650 
I'm gonna go ahead and kind of close out
on<00:04:27.600> this<00:04:27.780> DVD<00:04:28.380> here<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.340> just<00:04:30.240> let<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.510> know

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
on this DVD here and just let you know

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.460 
on this DVD here and just let you know
that<00:04:31.580> even<00:04:32.580> though<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.910> DVD<00:04:33.390> is<00:04:33.690> degraded<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
that even though the DVD is degraded a

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.110 
that even though the DVD is degraded a
lot<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.800> these<00:04:34.920> other<00:04:35.310> programs<00:04:35.610> like<00:04:35.940> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
lot of these other programs like the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.970 
lot of these other programs like the
internet<00:04:36.450> there's<00:04:36.960> no<00:04:37.140> pixel<00:04:37.650> degradation

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
internet there's no pixel degradation

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.120 
internet there's no pixel degradation
and<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.820> lot<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.600> these<00:04:39.690> other<00:04:39.960> programs<00:04:40.560> like

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
and a lot of these other programs like

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.170 
and a lot of these other programs like
when<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.310> go<00:04:41.460> into<00:04:42.680> where<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:44.030> when<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.090> go

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
when I go into where is it when I go

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.500 
when I go into where is it when I go
into<00:04:45.300> logic<00:04:46.160> when<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.430> interface<00:04:47.910> let<00:04:48.450> me

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
into logic when the interface let me

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.310 
into logic when the interface let me
just<00:04:48.690> open<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:48.990> up<00:04:49.200> here<00:04:53.840> as<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:54.990> can<00:04:55.110> see<00:04:55.260> in

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
just open this up here as you can see in

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.230 
just open this up here as you can see in
here<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.710> whole<00:04:55.740> interface<00:04:56.280> is<00:04:56.490> great<00:04:56.790> looks

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
here the whole interface is great looks

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.100 
here the whole interface is great looks
fantastic

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
fantastic

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.050 
fantastic
see<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> mouse<00:04:58.740> here<00:04:58.950> mouse<00:04:59.790> is<00:05:00.030> very

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
see the mouse here mouse is very

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.540 
see the mouse here mouse is very
degraded<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.470> looks<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:02.190> code<00:05:02.400> is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
degraded and it looks like the code is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.360 
degraded and it looks like the code is
coming<00:05:02.820> through<00:05:03.030> here<00:05:03.440> but<00:05:04.440> I'm<00:05:04.980> gonna<00:05:05.130> try

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
coming through here but I'm gonna try

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.040 
coming through here but I'm gonna try
and<00:05:05.550> get<00:05:05.640> down<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.030> bottom<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.419> this<00:05:06.600> and

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
and get down to the bottom of this and

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.409 
and get down to the bottom of this and
see<00:05:07.410> exactly<00:05:08.100> what<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.490> deal<00:05:08.790> is<00:05:08.820> with<00:05:09.060> all

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
see exactly what the deal is with all

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.710 
see exactly what the deal is with all
these<00:05:10.550> malfunctions<00:05:11.550> with<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.270> icons

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
these malfunctions with the the icons

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.440 
these malfunctions with the the icons
and<00:05:12.930> stuff<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:13.500> my<00:05:14.010> guess<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:15.000> has<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.300> do

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
and stuff so my guess is it has to do

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.740 
and stuff so my guess is it has to do
with<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:17.160> graphics<00:05:17.550> board<00:05:17.760> or<00:05:18.030> even<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.419> in

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
with the graphics board or even the in

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.560 
with the graphics board or even the in
the<00:05:19.350> inverter<00:05:19.680> board<00:05:20.010> what<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.340> side<00:05:21.180> might

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
the inverter board what the side might

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.110 
the inverter board what the side might
be<00:05:21.720> going<00:05:21.990> out<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.860> don't<00:05:23.250> know<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.550> mean<00:05:23.669> just

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
be going out so I don't know I mean just

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.860 
be going out so I don't know I mean just
try<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:25.070> exhaust<00:05:26.070> all<00:05:26.370> my<00:05:26.479> avenues<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:27.660> try

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
try and exhaust all my avenues and try

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.180 
try and exhaust all my avenues and try
and<00:05:27.990> get<00:05:28.080> down<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.380> bottom<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:28.890> but

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
and get down to the bottom of this but

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.040 
and get down to the bottom of this but
anyway<00:05:29.729> it's<00:05:29.910> running<00:05:30.240> very<00:05:30.510> smoothly<00:05:30.870> and

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
anyway it's running very smoothly and

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.870 
anyway it's running very smoothly and

you guys and just to just to let you
know<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.479> capacitors<00:05:43.110> must<00:05:43.290> be<00:05:43.470> working<00:05:43.860> cuz

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
know the capacitors must be working cuz

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.200 
know the capacitors must be working cuz
look<00:05:44.310> at<00:05:45.180> how<00:05:45.479> smooth<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:47.250> icons<00:05:47.580> are<00:05:47.820> and<00:05:48.000> as

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
look at how smooth the icons are and as

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.330 
look at how smooth the icons are and as
you<00:05:48.450> can<00:05:48.570> see<00:05:48.630> in<00:05:48.990> my<00:05:49.169> mouse<00:05:49.410> here<00:05:50.180> there<00:05:51.180> is<00:05:51.390> no

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
you can see in my mouse here there is no

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.460 
you can see in my mouse here there is no
pixel<00:05:53.340> dead<00:05:53.940> rotations<00:05:54.419> kind<00:05:54.840> of<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:54.990> way<00:05:55.140> but

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
pixel dead rotations kind of a way but

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.360 
pixel dead rotations kind of a way but
there<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:56.190> little<00:05:56.910> bit<00:05:57.120> at<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.510> top<00:05:57.750> here

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
there is a little bit at the top here

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:05.300 
there is a little bit at the top here
some<00:05:59.370> degradation<00:06:01.430> but<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.850> looks<00:06:03.180> like<00:06:04.310> for

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
some degradation but it looks like for

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.290 
some degradation but it looks like for
the<00:06:05.370> most<00:06:05.520> part<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:06.030> just<00:06:06.419> kind<00:06:06.630> of<00:06:06.690> went<00:06:06.840> away

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.570 

the<00:06:09.660> true<00:06:09.870> test<00:06:10.139> will<00:06:10.229> be<00:06:10.500> actually<00:06:11.250> if<00:06:11.430> I

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
the true test will be actually if I

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.909 
the true test will be actually if I
actually<00:06:11.760> go<00:06:12.060> into<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.570> DVD<00:06:14.960> here<00:06:15.960> I'm<00:06:16.650> gonna

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
actually go into the DVD here I'm gonna

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.390 
actually go into the DVD here I'm gonna
click<00:06:17.160> on<00:06:17.280> it<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.580> see<00:06:17.760> if<00:06:17.820> we<00:06:18.750> have<00:06:18.780> some

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
click on it and see if we have some

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.090 
click on it and see if we have some
pixel<00:06:20.419> degradation<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.990> if<00:06:22.080> it<00:06:22.199> comes<00:06:22.290> back

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:34.159 

last<00:06:26.100> time<00:06:26.400> played<00:06:32.300> it<00:06:33.300> looks<00:06:33.540> like<00:06:33.750> we<00:06:33.960> have<00:06:34.139> a

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
last time played it looks like we have a

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.330 
last time played it looks like we have a
success<00:06:34.710> hearing<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.669> they<00:06:36.180> say<00:06:36.510> because

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
success hearing and they say because

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.430 
success hearing and they say because
there<00:06:38.340> is<00:06:38.490> no<00:06:38.699> more<00:06:39.060> pixel<00:06:39.479> degradation<00:06:39.780> so<00:06:40.410> I

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
there is no more pixel degradation so I

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.140 
there is no more pixel degradation so I
just<00:06:40.620> kind<00:06:40.830> of<00:06:40.860> disappeared<00:06:41.430> so<00:06:41.639> that<00:06:41.789> is<00:06:41.940> good

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
just kind of disappeared so that is good

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.620 
just kind of disappeared so that is good

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
percentage less somebody okay we were up

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.300 
percentage less somebody okay we were up
against<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.479> and<00:06:51.510> just<00:06:51.960> kill<00:06:52.229> this<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:53.190> it

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310

looks like we are working just fine now
another<00:06:57.930> test<00:06:58.470> is<00:06:58.800> to<00:06:59.160> actually<00:06:59.880> go<00:07:00.270> into<00:07:00.419> a

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
another test is to actually go into a

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.770 
another test is to actually go into a

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
lot of CPU and I noticed that motion was

lot of CPU and I noticed that motion was
giving<00:07:07.530> me<00:07:07.650> some<00:07:07.770> problems<00:07:07.979> so<00:07:08.310> I'm<00:07:08.370> gonna<00:07:08.520> try

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
to go in here and it looks like motions

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.020

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
motion and it looks like we're back to

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.060 
motion and it looks like we're back to
normal

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.070 
normal

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.659
