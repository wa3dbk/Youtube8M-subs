was a little bit more challenging than

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.760 
was a little bit more challenging than
my<00:00:06.779> last<00:00:06.930> one<00:00:07.109> when<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.319> last<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.620> was<00:00:07.680> a

if<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.490> haven't<00:00:11.759> seen<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.910> one<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.269> was<00:00:12.389> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
if you haven't seen that one that was a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
if you haven't seen that one that was a
pretty<00:00:12.570> basic<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.110> Stewie<00:00:14.099> Griffin<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
pretty basic one Stewie Griffin I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.060 
pretty basic one Stewie Griffin I
thought<00:00:15.330> was<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.529> hard<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.010> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
thought was a bit of a hard one so I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.349 
thought was a bit of a hard one so I
decided<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> pick<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.210> this

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
decided to pick that one for this

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.570 
decided to pick that one for this
episode<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.289> couldn't<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.130> get<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> eyes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
episode I couldn't really get the eyes

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.849 
episode I couldn't really get the eyes
to<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.180> correct<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.320> might<00:00:22.650> look<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
to like correct so it might look a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
to like correct so it might look a
little<00:00:22.980> weird<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.850> i<00:00:23.910> think<00:00:23.970> from<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.420> glance

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
little weird but i think from a glance

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.140 
little weird but i think from a glance
it<00:00:24.990> looks<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.289> stewie<00:00:25.470> griffin<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
it looks like stewie griffin and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.339 
it looks like stewie griffin and
hopefully<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> guys<00:00:27.359> agree<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:27.990> um

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
hopefully you guys agree to that but um

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.230 
hopefully you guys agree to that but um
