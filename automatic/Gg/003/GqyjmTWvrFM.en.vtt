he was insane and his team of the season

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
he was insane and his team of the season
last<00:01:18.570> year<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.979> made<00:01:20.310> me<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
last year was what made me like this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
last year was what made me like this
card<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> yeah<00:01:21.900> obviously<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.500> FIFA<00:01:22.740> 15<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
card and yeah obviously on FIFA 15 is a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
card and yeah obviously on FIFA 15 is a
little<00:01:23.580> different<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.060> higher<00:01:24.450> rate

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
little different a little higher rate

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
little different a little higher rate
than<00:01:24.750> his<00:01:25.049> normal<00:01:25.350> card<00:01:25.770> last<00:01:25.979> fifa<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.549> yet

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
than his normal card last fifa and yet

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
than his normal card last fifa and yet
solid<00:01:27.299> starts<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:27.930> around<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> defense

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
solid starts all around so that defense

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
solid starts all around so that defense
is<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.280> solid<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.729> i<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.180> they're<00:01:30.390> all

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
is very solid and i think they're all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.249 
is very solid and i think they're all
over<00:01:30.720> 6<00:01:31.079> foot<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> small<00:01:32.759> defense

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
over 6 foot it's kind of a small defense

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
over 6 foot it's kind of a small defense
compared<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.220> they're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
compared what you can get but they're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.240 
compared what you can get but they're
really<00:01:35.790> pc<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> yeah<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.020> may<00:01:37.229> help<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:38.070> up

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
really pc and yeah that may help make up

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.149 
really pc and yeah that may help make up
for<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.750> back<00:01:40.020> i'm<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.100> sure

this team is perfect now we've got
Michael<00:02:53.900> Carrick<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.530> left<00:02:54.709> he's<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> good

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
Michael Carrick on the left he's a good

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.430 
Michael Carrick on the left he's a good
passer<00:02:55.400> six<00:02:56.209> foot<00:02:56.420> two<00:02:56.630> as<00:02:56.780> well<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.110> he<00:02:57.260> can

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
passer six foot two as well so he can

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.680 
passer six foot two as well so he can
head<00:02:57.650> down<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.250> well<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.940> only<00:02:59.209> problem<00:02:59.420> is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
head down as well the only problem is

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.660 
head down as well the only problem is
sometimes<00:02:59.959> if<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.440> goes<00:03:00.590> off<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.010> an<00:03:01.069> angolan

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
sometimes if it goes off to an angolan

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.520 
sometimes if it goes off to an angolan
obviously<00:03:02.090> he's<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.450> small<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:02.780> sometimes

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
obviously he's little small so sometimes

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.699 
obviously he's little small so sometimes
you'll<00:03:04.190> get<00:03:04.430> our<00:03:05.030> muscle<00:03:05.780> kind<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.500> out

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
you'll get our muscle kind of and out

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.440 
you'll get our muscle kind of and out
headed<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.430> why<00:03:07.640> I've<00:03:07.819> got<00:03:07.970> calm<00:03:08.269> cool

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
headed so that's why I've got calm cool

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.120 
headed so that's why I've got calm cool
and<00:03:08.510> cast<00:03:08.870> down<00:03:09.050> there<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.380> they<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.530> catch<00:03:09.890> in

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
and cast down there so they can catch in

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.069 
and cast down there so they can catch in
but<00:03:10.310> anyway<00:03:10.580> on<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.209> left<00:03:11.420> we're<00:03:11.900> going<00:03:12.019> to

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
but anyway on the left we're going to

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.350 
but anyway on the left we're going to
have<00:03:12.260> another<00:03:12.799> PSG<00:03:13.340> player<00:03:13.610> probably<00:03:14.180> should

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
have another PSG player probably should

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.449 
have another PSG player probably should
have<00:03:14.450> put<00:03:14.600> this<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:14.900> before<00:03:15.290> he's<00:03:16.130> very
