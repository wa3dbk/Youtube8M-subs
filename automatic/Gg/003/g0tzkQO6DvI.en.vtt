for about $4 each they're pretty

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.120 
for about $4 each they're pretty
expensive<00:02:35.150> pens<00:02:36.080> guess<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.890> good

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130

like<00:02:45.319> $8.00

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
like $8.00

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.470 
like $8.00
the<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.890> good<00:02:49.220> Bart<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.910> stuff<00:02:50.269> now

the it's good Bart and stuff now

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.960 
the it's good Bart and stuff now
pros<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.660> cons<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:55.010> one<00:02:55.250> knows<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.730> leak<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
pros and cons this one knows the leak a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.539 
pros and cons this one knows the leak a
bit<00:02:56.090> too<00:02:56.480> much<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.410> press<00:02:57.680> down<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.250> and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
that can get a bit annoying the price

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.030 
that can get a bit annoying the price
that<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.540> bit<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.230> letdown<00:03:06.470> there<00:03:07.010> a

that is just a bit of a letdown there a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.800 
that is just a bit of a letdown there a
bit<00:03:07.280> too<00:03:07.430> expensive<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:10.390> especially<00:03:11.390> if<00:03:11.690> you
