00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.930
 today we will make Chinese meat 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.910
 cakes that are generally big 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.000
 our dumplings are very similar to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.070
 only great connections with this take the dough 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 do the dough just like we do on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 dumplings on dumplings recipe like 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.119
 there is dough on our video channel and do 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.190
 minced meat allows you to make such 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 how do you like him if you want more 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.100
 Chinese option instead of green can 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.590
 add there 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.330
 green onions and minced make such here 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.550
 wet enough to get smeared 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.660
 the whole idea of ​​these lozenges is to make them puff 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.840
 and fold as they put them in 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.100
 China 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.180
 naturally with a bullet surface and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 roll out the dough take the dough size 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.130
 something like a tennis ball 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.820
 smaller but one cake of it 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.820
 enough 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.630
 dough roll out quite thinly in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.190
 principle width should be such as 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.260
 you are more comfortable with some love 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.540
 for example thick lines so why not 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.940
 the form in which you roll is not 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.060
 must be completely round if she 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.630
 slightly rectangular it will suit you even 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.240
 more 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 now you need to cut this dough 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 approximately as if we are going to 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.590
 play tic-tac-toe ie there are two 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.560
 notch the bottom and two on top now need 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 put stuffing on the entire surface for 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 except for the top of this one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.820
 triangle stuffing lay out 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.070
 can be hand can be left with a spoon 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.540
 naturally seam allowances ie 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.130
 very edge and here we will not 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.450
 fold wherever there are cuts we 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.720
 leave small seams 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.210
 the thickness of the mince again depends on 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.759
 how much do you prefer what are you 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.750
 prefer meat dumplings more 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.750
 you are welcome 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.490
 mince and you can put like me to you 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.170
 said any thickness only in the last 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.850
 triangles here this triangle you 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.070
 will be on the opposite diagonal 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.830
 fold last here 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.660
 mince need to put a little to be 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.510
 must be very thin so 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.760
 way laid out the whole stuffing and start 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.440
 collect our cake first add up 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.440
 Here we cover this part 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.930
 so then I must say that children need 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.830
 involve in this occupation unconditionally 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.830
 I like it very much 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.760
 and cover the last part now we 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.190
 we can make a little cake 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.140
 thinner, in principle, of course did not want to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.450
 to tear but if it breaks 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.110
 it does not bother you, you can sprinkle with flour 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.660
 and nothing terrible will of course 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.690
 so such dumplings are such flat cakes they are not 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.400
 roll them need to roast in 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.630
 vegetable oil from two sides 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.330
 that to him now and show now choose 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.360
 yourself that it is more convenient to stick dumplings that 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.680
 I don’t know what to do in 2025 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.200
 fry such a cake warmed up 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.540
 vegetable oil, first put the seam 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.670
 way down 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.890
 literally a couple of minutes with each 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.680
 parties just to get beautiful 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.680
 crust fry we will be under the lid 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.190
 crust small got fry on 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.190
 the other side 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.400
 bring to readiness steamed ear 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.570
 I add literally just a little bit 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:35.530
 I'm afraid there will be a splash of water under the mat 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.530
 lid steamed cake 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.930
 I would keep a minute or two since 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.160
 one side steaming 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.160
 now we do the same with the other 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 some water 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:13.400
 we have a crust and peppa ready 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.290
 I highly recommend you to try
