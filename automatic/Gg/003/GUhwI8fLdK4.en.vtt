00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
artificial sweeteners you're kind of

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.569 
artificial sweeteners you're kind of
making<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:33.990> harder<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.380> yourself<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
just a thought the third tip would be do

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.270 
just a thought the third tip would be do
not<00:01:40.970> micromanage<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.210> diet<00:01:43.130> focus<00:01:44.130> on

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
not micromanage your diet focus on

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.780 
not micromanage your diet focus on

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
getting a good balance of carbs proteins

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.780 
getting a good balance of carbs proteins
and<00:01:48.180> fats<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> also<00:01:50.159> look<00:01:50.549> at

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and fats and you can also look at

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.999 
and fats and you can also look at
nutrient<00:01:51.630> timing<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.320> example<00:01:52.710> after

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
nutrient timing for example after

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.060 
nutrient timing for example after
workout<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.920> carbs<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
workout you want to have carbs and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.459 
workout you want to have carbs and
protein<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:57.540> before<00:01:57.780> bed<00:01:58.200> you'll

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
protein you know maybe before bed you'll

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.510 
protein you know maybe before bed you'll
have<00:01:58.759> proteins<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.090> fats<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.310> always

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
have proteins and fats so you can always

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
have proteins and fats so you can always
time<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.329> way<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.710> stuck

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
time it out that way but don't get stuck

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
time it out that way but don't get stuck
on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:06.090> things<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.110> don't

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
on the little things and you know don't

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.339 
on the little things and you know don't
count<00:02:07.799> calories<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.670> calorie

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
count calories for calorie
