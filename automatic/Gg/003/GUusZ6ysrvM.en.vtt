so<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.050> key<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.710> start<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.160> a<00:01:38.190> cord

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
so the key of a we start with the a cord

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.750 
so the key of a we start with the a cord
which<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.200> next<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> top<00:01:40.680> string<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.670> the

index finger and then the second fret

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.710 
index finger and then the second fret
top<00:01:45.960> string<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.910> -<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:51.180> comes<00:01:51.420> at

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
top string so that one - a that comes at

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
top string so that one - a that comes at
side<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.340> put<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.580> little<00:01:53.640> grace<00:01:54.060> note

I'm gonna go to a c-sharp minor' there's

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.690 
I'm gonna go to a c-sharp minor' there's
two<00:03:56.330> ways<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.630> doing<00:03:56.690> this<00:03:57.020> I<00:03:57.520> could<00:03:58.520> do<00:03:58.610> it

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
two ways of doing this I could do it

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.790 
two ways of doing this I could do it
like<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:58.850> C<00:03:59.120> minor<00:03:59.390> or<00:03:59.630> like<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.780> bee<00:04:00.080> just<00:04:00.350> slide

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
like a C minor or like a bee just slide

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370 
like a C minor or like a bee just slide
it<00:04:00.950> up<00:04:01.040> here<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.519> pads<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.360> middle<00:04:03.050> finger

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
it up here the pads of the middle finger

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.670 
it up here the pads of the middle finger
on<00:04:03.500> these<00:04:03.650> two<00:04:04.310> strings<00:04:04.640> in<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.350> fourth<00:04:06.350> fret

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
on these two strings in the fourth fret

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.650 
on these two strings in the fourth fret
and<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.700> third<00:04:08.660> finger<00:04:09.170> on<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:10.300> fourth<00:04:11.300> fret

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
and the third finger on the fourth fret

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.759 
and the third finger on the fourth fret
bottom<00:04:12.200> string<00:04:13.510> people<00:04:14.510> dying<00:04:14.780> or<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.290> could<00:04:15.650> do

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
bottom string people dying or I could do

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.580 
bottom string people dying or I could do
it<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:17.030> way<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.209> prefer<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.810> do<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.290> press

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
it the way I prefer to do it is to press

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.050 
it the way I prefer to do it is to press
down<00:04:18.769> on<00:04:18.830> these<00:04:19.010> two<00:04:19.070> strings<00:04:19.489> with<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.700> index

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
down on these two strings with the index

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.880 
down on these two strings with the index
finger<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.630> then<00:04:21.260> do<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.470> little<00:04:21.560> bit<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.830> a

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
finger and then do a little bit of a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.370 
finger and then do a little bit of a
stretch<00:04:22.190> with<00:04:22.460> the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
stretch with the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.000 
stretch with the
little<00:04:24.380> finger

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.020 

to<00:04:28.010> lambda<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.990> live<00:04:30.520> then<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:31.760> D

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
to lambda and to live then you go to D

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.960 
to lambda and to live then you go to D
which<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.230> third<00:04:33.860> finger<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.460> this<00:04:34.790> one

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
which is the third finger and this one

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.410 
which is the third finger and this one
we<00:04:35.060> already<00:04:35.180> did<00:04:35.390> very<00:04:35.720> showed<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:37.420> the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
we already did very showed that the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.410 
we already did very showed that the
greatest<00:04:38.750> gift<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.530> all<00:04:39.950> then<00:04:40.460> then<00:04:40.790> to<00:04:40.910> e<00:04:43.420> and

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
greatest gift of all then then to e and

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.780 
greatest gift of all then then to e and
you<00:04:44.450> could<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:44.930> do<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.800> do<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.400> or<00:04:46.700> you

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
you could just do it do that or you

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.400 
you could just do it do that or you
could<00:04:46.940> do<00:04:47.500> like<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.810> depends<00:04:51.140> on<00:04:51.260> what

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
could do like that this depends on what

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.260 
could do like that this depends on what
kind<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.620> sound<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:51.980> want<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.250> get<00:04:52.400> maybe<00:04:53.090> in

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
kind of sound you want to get maybe in

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.580 
kind of sound you want to get maybe in
one<00:04:53.390> part<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.780> song<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.080> want<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.290> do<00:04:54.380> one

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
one part of the song you want to do one

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.050 
one part of the song you want to do one

then the other part you want to do that

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.930 
then the other part you want to do that
one<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.630> make<00:04:57.230> it<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.410> little<00:04:57.470> variety<00:04:57.940> maybe

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
one to make it a little variety maybe

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.340 
one to make it a little variety maybe
later<00:04:59.240> in<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.480> song<00:04:59.660> that<00:04:59.870> one<00:05:00.080> because<00:05:00.260> it's

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
later in the song that one because it's

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
we are the world this is why I like this

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.020 
we are the world this is why I like this
key<00:05:29.150> because<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.420> can<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:30.170> can<00:05:30.560> go<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:30.860> high<00:05:31.070> we

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
key because I can I can go that high we

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.370 
key because I can I can go that high we
are<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.570> world<00:05:34.570> we<00:05:35.570> are<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.870> children

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
are the world we are the children

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.580 
are the world we are the children
and<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.390> we<00:05:41.350> are<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.530> world<00:05:42.840> de7<00:05:43.840> we<00:05:44.440> are

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
and so that we are the world de7 we are

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.290 
and so that we are the world de7 we are
the<00:05:44.800> children<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:46.260> then<00:05:47.260> a<00:05:47.500> seventh<00:05:48.090> just<00:05:49.090> let

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
the children a then a seventh just let

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.120 
the children a then a seventh just let
go<00:05:49.510> of<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:49.810> top<00:05:50.050> one<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.440> play<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:50.950> move

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
go of the top one and play that move

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.870 
go of the top one and play that move
that<00:05:51.460> one<00:05:51.640> string<00:05:52.170> we<00:05:53.170> are<00:05:53.200> the<00:05:53.650> ones<00:05:53.920> to<00:05:54.460> make

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
that one string we are the ones to make

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.130 
that one string we are the ones to make
a<00:05:54.940> brighter<00:05:55.090> day<00:05:55.480> so<00:05:55.770> let's<00:05:56.770> start<00:05:57.010> giving
