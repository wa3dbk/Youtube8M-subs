of the Raptor the rocker camber actually
is<00:02:30.040> centered<00:02:30.400> on<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:32.170> we<00:02:32.320> have<00:02:32.440> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
is centered on this but we have a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.620 
is centered on this but we have a
sharper<00:02:33.010> trailing<00:02:33.550> side<00:02:33.820> cut<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.270> if<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.480> like
