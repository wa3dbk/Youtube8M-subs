00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi guys my name is Anton and we 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:13.860
 continue to pass assassin's creed 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:22.430
 unity and now a little bit about so but 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:25.430
 The log of the battle is not so what was it that lags 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.430
 from where 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.820
 friends is just a scribe game live not 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.280
 lagged 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.379
 there was no such thing right at the beginning 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.370
 new optimization here is yubisoft just 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:49.510
 hit quotes that watch dogs 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.199
 that this is a solid milling cutter on level ground 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.989
 while there is no grafona which 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.199
 can just cause such cutters 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.510
 brakes and even more so system 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.180
 requirements like 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.289
 damn yes the same black flag I went to 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.280
 five times better is generally stable there 470 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:20.649
 frames was here do not understand that I 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:24.660
 seriously last better optimization 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.660
 tribes of is far cry 3 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.180
 what the hell is this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.290
 now paris is open to us 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.290
 That's probably why it all started to freeze up 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.530
 which so the hair stretched pay 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.180
 Attention 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.170
 just notice what kind of hair 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.000
 severely stretched so absolutely and 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:21.069
 Generally what Paris is it in size 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.640
 let's we check the stacks crave 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.670
 show the map where the map is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.400
 I need a map, but here it is and here it is 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.430
 I will decide here it is Paris, yes I now understand 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.250
 why is everything so freeze nothing because 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.310
 for us opened paris friends yes now 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.190
 we can run anywhere anywhere so 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.470
 I don't know if it makes sense to go through this. 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.130
 game with such optimization 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.560
 I seriously yes even on consoles in my 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.720
 it makes no sense because even there the cutters 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.910
 there is truth not in such quantities 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 of course as on the pis 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.220
 but still there is optimization there 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:09.440
 Generally garena and at a resolution of 900 pixels 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.560
 these saying here so what is it in technical 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.750
 the plan is a failure that is a grafon which 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.360
 to the level of a nekst-gene does not reach at all 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.220
 absolutely nothing horror itself naturally 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.810
 what the developers were thinking I am not 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.140
 I imagine that they are there 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.650
 represented 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.579
 what is it normal optimization yes when 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.070
 below 30 fps 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.690
 when such friezes are constantly going on 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.730
 any iron is not iron 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.430
 case if someone starts saying that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.040
 supposedly iron all depends on iron neither 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.440
 horseradish iron does not depend on there people 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.739
 launched on these machines this game that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.019
 just there you can even launch into space 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.090
 anything and out assassin's creed 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.540
 unity they have a freeze just as well 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.260
 Therefore, this failure is Yubisoft, namely 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.480
 failure 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.700
 failure is also understandable as in the case 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.680
 with watch dogs you can take my nose 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.530
 not everything was disgusting like here 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.680
 although I do not know helped one field berries 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.830
 here and in that and in another case frieze he 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.840
 It has a cutter is not really nice 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.750
 playing with this optimization is very 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.490
 very well, and then of course we can be 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.010
 and leave go finger that this thing 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.320
 fix well I doubt something i 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.480
 very much doubt because one 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.800
 the case when it just sinks fps it 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.320
 can fix patches 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.950
 and another maiden when everything is freeze and already 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.940
 By itself, the game is such that it is the hands of 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:46.090
 ass hands from ass and hands in ass 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.730
 that's what it's called with software 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.460
 principle of the game itself 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.370
 I like an interesting plot of course 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.530
 I did not play all the assassins absolutely 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.960
 maybe that's why I like him and others 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.510
 people says 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.030
 reviewers there in 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.910
 all sorts of different western editions of such 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.480
 like ah gi euro euro gamers out there and others 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.340
 they say that the game is just shit here and there 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.680
 they have some kind of argument 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.480
 they say the missions in the game are disgusting 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.220
 can not be so it can be 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.380
 they really slips into shit and a little 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.460
 later just not now i can't 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.360
 say for sure 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.350
 but in any case, I started to like it 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.300
 I liked it very much but 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.910
 artificial intelligence the dumbest people 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.130
 just under the crowd there you were paying 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.500
 attention to in the initial not all huge 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.700
 the crowd are all made with a carbon copy and 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.460
 so noticeable that how not to draw 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.440
 attention is absolutely impossible if 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.810
 the earlier parts was more or less been 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.540
 diversity in the crowd yes then it was 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:58.690
 cool and now someone copied about 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.930
 let's say green clothes blue 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.540
 clothes and all this this this this this just 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:12.970
 awful I'm sure let's go now 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:15.940
 specially come down well oh yes yes here 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:21.550
 the whole essence of assassin's creed unity here it is 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:25.990
 the whole essence of friends is just like that 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.750
 will definitely come out of here or or as or 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:33.370
 or or you are available but generally zashib 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.970
 excellent excellent this is real itself 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.580
 parkour 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.720
 so write in the comments whether 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.630
 pass this game or or or get up 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.680
 Saybota yes here are gone as he sharply 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.680
 then flew up 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.240
 Virgo 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.640
 Well, you can, in principle, on the suit 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.910
 pay attention pay attention 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.610
 just what are the people go brother here 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.940
 Of course not so noticeable but still all 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.340
 same 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.210
 that is, the same clothes are absolutely 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.490
 by copying on the same thing here 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:17.470
 let's say from a man goes to blue here 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:19.820
 here he is dragging a box go here here is a man 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.730
 peasant handbag him just on the other 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.040
 the sides are the same absolutely for everyone 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:29.210
 blue clothes fashion such stability 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:34.010
 clothes don't understand what's going on there yes 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:37.570
 Well, here I am generally silent man just 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.570
 as a ghost soared above the ground 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.720
 but the topic has something interesting 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:50.000
 something interesting is happening here 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.650
 one to eight happens then on this 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.150
 release complete put your finger up 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.139
 add followers all thanks for 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.139
 attention and bye
