and<00:01:51.180> runs<00:01:51.480> good<00:01:51.750> performance<00:01:52.440> is<00:01:52.590> good

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.340 

kind<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:03.980> loud<00:02:04.130> more<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:04.970> wanted<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.570> liked

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
kind of loud more and I wanted I liked

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
it better when the can was longer so I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.510 
it better when the can was longer so I
don't<00:02:09.170> know<00:02:09.229> if<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.440> recommend<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.160> if<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
don't know if I recommend it if you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.720 
don't know if I recommend it if you

a<00:02:13.790> good<00:02:13.940> sound<00:02:14.270> performance<00:02:14.959> I'd<00:02:15.140> stay<00:02:15.380> with

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
a good sound performance I'd stay with

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.110 
a good sound performance I'd stay with
longer<00:02:15.950> cam<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.170> will<00:02:18.350> be<00:02:18.640> switching<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
longer cam so I will be switching to a
