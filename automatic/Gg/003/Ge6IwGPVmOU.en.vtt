so<00:00:00.240> many<00:00:00.480> we<00:00:00.630> have<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.780> ruptured<00:00:01.170> LED<00:00:01.650> made<00:00:02.490> in

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so many we have a ruptured LED made in

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.349 
so many we have a ruptured LED made in
the<00:00:02.790> USA<00:00:04.400> we're<00:00:05.400> going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.670> just<00:00:05.790> see<00:00:06.210> how

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the USA we're going to just see how

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:20.980 
the USA we're going to just see how
strong<00:00:06.660> they<00:00:06.899> are

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.310 

what<00:00:21.990> new<00:00:22.490> raven<00:00:23.490> black<00:00:23.699> blade<00:00:26.869> very<00:00:27.869> strong

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
what new raven black blade very strong

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.590 
what new raven black blade very strong
look<00:00:31.099> this<00:00:32.099> blade<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:33.989> aerodynamic

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
look this blade is not very aerodynamic

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.119 
look this blade is not very aerodynamic
because<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.629> shared<00:00:36.989> ground<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.559> he's<00:00:37.980> not

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
because a shared ground here he's not

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.990 
because a shared ground here he's not
very<00:00:38.339> good<00:00:39.140> romp<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.580> lump<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
very good romp in it and the lump on the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.100 
very good romp in it and the lump on the
back<00:00:43.910> these<00:00:44.910> blades<00:00:45.269> come<00:00:45.510> off<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.750> damaged

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
back these blades come off a damaged

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.939 
back these blades come off a damaged
winter<00:00:46.589> band<00:00:47.720> who<00:00:48.720> mounted<00:00:49.110> too<00:00:49.320> close<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
winter band who mounted too close to the

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
winter band who mounted too close to the
pool<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:53.309> made<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.090> cheap<00:00:54.390> recycle

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
pool it's made out of a cheap recycle

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.849 
pool it's made out of a cheap recycle
plastic<00:00:55.730> compound<00:00:56.730> made<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.480> China<00:00:57.859> with

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
plastic compound made in China with

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.820 
plastic compound made in China with
added<00:00:59.280> milk<00:00:59.940> powder<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.629> colouring<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:03.830> this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
added milk powder for colouring and this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.310 
added milk powder for colouring and this
is<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> whole<00:01:06.530> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.710> look<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.009> this<00:01:08.160> here

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
is the whole if you look at this here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.529 
is the whole if you look at this here
we've<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.560> each<00:01:10.920> blade<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.610> martir<00:01:12.179> his

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
we've got each blade at martir his

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.930 
we've got each blade at martir his
overlap<00:01:13.289> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> next<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.759> will<00:01:14.910> be

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
overlap in the next one so it will be

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.810 
overlap in the next one so it will be
very<00:01:15.210> efficient<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:15.990> wind<00:01:16.679> because<00:01:17.280> half<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
very efficient in wind because half of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.449 
very efficient in wind because half of
the<00:01:17.910> blade<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.360> lost<00:01:21.770> look<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.039> overlap

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
the blade is lost look for the overlap

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:39.010 
the blade is lost look for the overlap
in<00:01:25.220> these<00:01:26.220> blades<00:01:26.550> offer<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.980 

so<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.260> is<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> home<00:01:41.030> she<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.630> damaged

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
so this is a home she look into damaged

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
so this is a home she look into damaged
home<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.550> twisted<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.510> like<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.610> ball

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
home it all twisted it's like a a ball

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.960 
home it all twisted it's like a a ball
all<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.900> all<00:01:49.080> around<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> edge<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.020 

and<00:01:56.480> it's<00:01:56.660> very<00:01:56.690> same

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
and it's very same

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.580 
and it's very same
sure<00:01:58.840> our<00:01:59.770> hopes<00:02:00.190> were<00:02:00.400> wheels<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:02.020> twice<00:02:02.350> as

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
sure our hopes were wheels that twice as

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.960 
sure our hopes were wheels that twice as
thick<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.390> powder<00:02:04.750> caught<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.580> how's<00:02:06.580> our<00:02:06.820> new

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
thick and powder caught in how's our new

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.300 
thick and powder caught in how's our new
home<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.979> one<00:02:09.190> here<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:10.830> an<00:02:11.830> older<00:02:12.160> home

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
home and this one here is an older home

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.510 
home and this one here is an older home
and<00:02:12.550> sold<00:02:12.819> twice<00:02:13.090> as<00:02:13.330> thick<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.790> plated<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
and sold twice as thick and plated the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.130 
and sold twice as thick and plated the
problem<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.700> there's<00:02:19.300> too<00:02:19.540> many<00:02:19.750> blades

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
problem is there's too many blades

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.370 
problem is there's too many blades
mounted<00:02:20.770> on<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> small<00:02:21.280> hob<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:23.040> blade<00:02:24.040> 11<00:02:24.910> blade

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
mounted on a small hob a blade 11 blade

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.900 
mounted on a small hob a blade 11 blade
too<00:02:26.380> close<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.760> compared<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.540> our<00:02:29.190> 12<00:02:30.190> lead

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.340 

every<00:02:33.910> blade<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:34.630> spaced<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:40.350> there's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
every blade is well spaced so there's

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:52.530 
every blade is well spaced so there's
gaps<00:02:42.239> between<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.569> mid<00:02:46.890> see<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> super
