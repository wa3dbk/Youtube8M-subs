exotic now the idea of the weapon was
great<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.750> really<00:00:57.170> love<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.500> fact<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.860> could

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
great I really love the fact you could

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.100 
great I really love the fact you could
start<00:00:58.220> with<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.400> basic<00:00:58.760> common<00:00:59.420> weapon<00:00:59.600> and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
start with a basic common weapon and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.960 
start with a basic common weapon and
then<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.560> eventually<00:01:00.860> became<00:01:01.310> an<00:01:01.460> exotic<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
then it eventually became an exotic it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.359 
then it eventually became an exotic it
was<00:01:02.060> a<00:01:02.120> great<00:01:02.329> concept<00:01:02.810> but<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.440> D&amp;D<00:01:03.860> weapon

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
was a great concept but in D&amp;D weapon

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.460 
was a great concept but in D&amp;D weapon
was<00:01:04.610> absolutely<00:01:05.390> terrible<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.170> eyes<00:01:06.259> of

the community some might argue that it
was<00:01:08.390> pretty<00:01:08.600> decent<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.200> at<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.439> end<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.619> the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
was pretty decent but at the end of the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740 
was pretty decent but at the end of the

a little bit of evidence of it but there

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.630 
a little bit of evidence of it but there

this<00:01:33.110> leads<00:01:33.320> me<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.650> speculate<00:01:34.040> one<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.790> two

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
this leads me to speculate one of two

this leads me to speculate one of two
things<00:01:35.030> either<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:36.530> are<00:01:36.620> going<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.860> be

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
things either a we are going to be

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.740
