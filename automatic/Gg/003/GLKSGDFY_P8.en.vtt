00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.250
 the upper part and bleachers 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.100
 we conclude at the end of August is a 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.190
 important step than to ilibar or 100% 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.190
 for usiminas to end the coverage 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.590
 with the completion of this step 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.790
 the structure of the grandstand today you 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 visualizes 360 Â° improvement that until then 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.850
 existed 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.330
 both in the stands and in the access 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.580
 for this level of the political grandstand 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.550
 of the lower bleachers you can 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.520
 make 360 degrees 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.630
 This is a big difference from the stadium. 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.180
 previously it had not been the hull 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.640
 and it did not have all 360 degrees 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.620
 Imagine a player down there is this 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.620
 here is a cauldron 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.930
 is a volume is a box is volume time 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.989
 too high we have more or less about 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.090
 35 meters here from the field to the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.239
 roof right 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.530
 so it is a very visual sensation 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.960
 interesting for whoever is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.690
 watching the game 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.700
 are two major concerns with sound 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.070
 here inside the arena first do not let 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 pass this sound to the neighboring agents to 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.660
 contain the sound in here 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.400
 and we also need to have a comfort 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.900
 quite interesting acoustic 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.610
 among the main ones 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 characteristics of the cut that we have 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.860
 a tile is that it has a certain 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.460
 Drilling down is important for 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.320
 absorbing bass and mid-range 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.770
 a theory developed for absorption 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.660
 and the lateral closure that the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.340
 here are those plates that form 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.980
 a kind of chicana are also two 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.800
 sound absorption boards with a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.230
 spacing and mismatch 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.330
 so that the airflow can escape from the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.600
 arena with that the trend is that people 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.040
 has no clean sound is here and 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.380
 concentrated right 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.710
 the idea is to be in a kind of 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.710
 cauldron 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.260
 it is 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.350
 tomorrow it is planned to raise the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.010
 the last beam that supports the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.850
 arena 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.090
 this line is 100 meters long 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.340
 and weighs 75 tonnes while specific 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.280
 for any thought not only is this 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.880
 climate can not rain example 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.080
 forecast that the climatic conditions 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.960
 Let's go and bid this piece. 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.270
 morning that the most important piece in 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.540
 terms of size and weight of the whole 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.540
 Stadium
