00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
is I'm going to start creating my warp

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.100 
is I'm going to start creating my warp
threads<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.700> wildfire<00:01:06.299> placed<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
threads so I have my wildfire placed in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010 
threads so I have my wildfire placed in
one<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> grooves<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.689> then<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
one of the grooves and then I'm just

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.910 
one of the grooves and then I'm just
going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:11.060> match<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.500> top<00:01:13.710> side

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
going to match that up on the top side

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.149 
going to match that up on the top side
there<00:01:14.570> flipping<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.810> over<00:01:16.040> wrapping<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
there flipping it over wrapping it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.580 
there flipping it over wrapping it
around<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.729> opposite<00:01:18.240> button<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> then

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
around the opposite button and then

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.140 
around the opposite button and then
skipping<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.520> groove<00:01:20.990> every<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:23.549> around

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
skipping a groove every time I go around

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
skipping a groove every time I go around
skipping<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.360> groove<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.680> keeping

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
skipping one groove and really keeping

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.840 
skipping one groove and really keeping
that<00:01:29.070> tension<00:01:29.729> nice<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.960> tight<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.729> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that tension nice and tight and then I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
that tension nice and tight and then I
would<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.030> wrap<00:01:33.689> around<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> back<00:01:34.890> button

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
would just wrap around the back button

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.340 
would just wrap around the back button
here<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> couple<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> times<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> would

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
here a couple of times and then I would

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.940 
here a couple of times and then I would
tie<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:40.170> needle<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
tie that off so I have my needle and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
tie that off so I have my needle and
thread<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> actually<00:01:42.600> mine<00:01:42.780> I'm<00:01:42.960> oh

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
thread and this is actually mine I'm oh

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
thread and this is actually mine I'm oh
and<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and what I'm going to do is take that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.639 
and what I'm going to do is take that
needle<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.600> going<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.439> over

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
needle and I'm just going up and over

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.609 
needle and I'm just going up and over
the<00:01:50.430> warp<00:01:50.670> threads<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> how<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the warp threads and this is how I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.340 
the warp threads and this is how I
choose<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> anchor<00:01:53.759> my<00:01:53.909> thread<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:55.229> I'm

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
choose to anchor my thread and then I'm

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.850 
choose to anchor my thread and then I'm
just<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> go<00:01:56.040> down<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> over

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
just going to go down up and over

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.569 
just going to go down up and over
weaving<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.070> out

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
weaving in and out

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.649 
weaving in and out
and<00:01:59.670> again<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:01.320> anchoring<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:03.270> thread

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and again just anchoring that thread

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
and again just anchoring that thread
alright<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.009> our<00:02:05.159> needle<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.579> thread

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
alright so we have our needle and thread

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210 
alright so we have our needle and thread
we're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.600> under<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.950> warp<00:02:08.160> threads

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
we're going to go under the warp threads

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.869 
we're going to go under the warp threads
and<00:02:09.020> again<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.319> happen<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:11.009> working<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
and again I happen to be working with a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.720 
and again I happen to be working with a
size<00:02:12.840> 8

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
size 8

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.690 
size 8
seedbead<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:15.140> could<00:02:15.349> certainly<00:02:15.680> use<00:02:15.800> six<00:02:16.459> O's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
seedbead you could certainly use six O's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.740 
seedbead you could certainly use six O's
eleven<00:02:17.659> O's<00:02:18.519> something<00:02:19.519> made<00:02:19.670> with<00:02:19.700> 15s<00:02:20.599> might

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
eleven O's something made with 15s might

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.039 
eleven O's something made with 15s might
even<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:21.140> really<00:02:21.409> cool<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.459> have<00:02:22.730> six<00:02:23.120> size

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
even be really cool so I have six size

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.280 
even be really cool so I have six size
eight<00:02:24.590> beads<00:02:25.099> on<00:02:25.370> my<00:02:25.519> needle<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.049> I'm<00:02:27.049> just

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
eight beads on my needle and I'm just

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.000 
eight beads on my needle and I'm just
going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.620> thread<00:02:28.190> those<00:02:28.400> down<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.980> use

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
going to thread those down you can use

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580 
going to thread those down you can use
bugle<00:02:31.700> beads<00:02:31.910> tile<00:02:32.540> beads<00:02:32.900> oh<00:02:33.140> my<00:02:33.290> goodness

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
bugle beads tile beads oh my goodness

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.809 
bugle beads tile beads oh my goodness
there's<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.129> many<00:02:34.220> different<00:02:34.580> beads<00:02:34.730> you

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
there's so many different beads you

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.390 
there's so many different beads you
could<00:02:34.970> use<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.450> create<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:36.319> base<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.860> your

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
could use to create the base of your

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.020 
could use to create the base of your
bracelet<00:02:37.849> now<00:02:38.540> here's<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.959> fun<00:02:39.110> part

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
bracelet now here's the fun part

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.000 
bracelet now here's the fun part
so<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:41.209> we're<00:02:41.360> going<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.599> do<00:02:41.810> did<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:42.860> see

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
so what we're going to do did you see

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.440 
so what we're going to do did you see
how<00:02:43.129> those<00:02:43.250> little<00:02:43.430> guys<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:43.700> popped<00:02:44.209> into

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
how those little guys just popped into

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.319 
how those little guys just popped into
their<00:02:44.690> own<00:02:44.840> little<00:02:45.019> alleyways<00:02:45.590> I'm<00:02:46.150> going<00:02:47.150> to

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
their own little alleyways I'm going to

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.440 
their own little alleyways I'm going to
take<00:02:47.900> my<00:02:48.110> needle<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.470> thread<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.450> I'm

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
take my needle and thread and I'm

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.069 
take my needle and thread and I'm
actually<00:02:50.780> running<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.709> on<00:02:51.859> top<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.810> warp

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
actually running it on top of the warp

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.349 
actually running it on top of the warp
threads<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.829> I'm<00:02:54.980> really<00:02:55.250> pushing<00:02:55.549> up<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
threads and I'm really pushing up to the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.440 
threads and I'm really pushing up to the
ceiling<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.620> make<00:02:57.859> sure<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.940> I'm<00:02:59.090> going

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
ceiling to make sure that I'm going

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.089 
ceiling to make sure that I'm going
through<00:02:59.780> all<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:01.160> beads<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.930> then<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:03.099> pull

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
through all the beads and then we pull

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.220 
through all the beads and then we pull
and<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.730> tug<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> little<00:03:05.480> bit<00:03:05.629> so<00:03:05.840> we<00:03:05.959> get<00:03:06.140> them

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and just tug a little bit so we get them

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.140 
and just tug a little bit so we get them
nice<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.680> taut<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.760> we're<00:03:07.910> going<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
nice and taut and then we're going to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.789 
nice and taut and then we're going to
come<00:03:08.420> back<00:03:08.599> under<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:11.230> once<00:03:12.230> again<00:03:12.410> we're

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
come back under and once again we're

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.229 
come back under and once again we're
picking<00:03:13.190> up<00:03:13.310> six<00:03:14.530> size<00:03:15.530> eight<00:03:15.890> beads<00:03:16.340> let's

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
picking up six size eight beads let's

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.610 
picking up six size eight beads let's
see<00:03:17.450> what<00:03:17.599> do<00:03:17.660> we<00:03:17.690> got<00:03:17.900> there<00:03:18.139> there's<00:03:18.530> six<00:03:20.620> so

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
see what do we got there there's six so

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.180 
see what do we got there there's six so
remember<00:03:22.010> how<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:22.160> did<00:03:22.430> seven<00:03:22.910> warp<00:03:23.150> threads

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
remember how we did seven warp threads

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.069 
remember how we did seven warp threads
we<00:03:25.190> did<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.609> because<00:03:25.849> we<00:03:26.030> needed<00:03:26.359> six<00:03:26.720> little

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
we did that because we needed six little

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.409 
we did that because we needed six little
alleyways<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> if<00:03:29.959> we<00:03:30.410> were<00:03:30.790> making<00:03:31.790> something

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
alleyways so if we were making something

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.170 
alleyways so if we were making something
wider<00:03:33.130> we<00:03:34.130> would<00:03:34.340> need<00:03:34.700> one<00:03:35.569> more<00:03:35.930> warp<00:03:36.680> thread

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
wider we would need one more warp thread

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.210 
wider we would need one more warp thread
to<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.329> amount<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.810> beads<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:39.739> if<00:03:39.919> we<00:03:40.069> were

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
to the amount of beads so if we were

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.000 
to the amount of beads so if we were
doing<00:03:40.579> eight<00:03:41.239> beads<00:03:41.660> we<00:03:42.109> would<00:03:42.290> need<00:03:42.500> nine

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
doing eight beads we would need nine

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.180 
doing eight beads we would need nine
warp<00:03:43.340> threads<00:03:43.810> we<00:03:44.810> were<00:03:44.959> doing<00:03:45.290> ten<00:03:45.560> beads<00:03:45.859> we

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
warp threads we were doing ten beads we

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.990 
warp threads we were doing ten beads we
would<00:03:46.370> need<00:03:46.519> eleven<00:03:47.150> warp<00:03:47.389> threads<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:49.549> you

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
would need eleven warp threads so you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.569 
would need eleven warp threads so you
would<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.150> continue<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:51.200> build<00:03:52.069> this<00:03:52.280> space

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
would just continue to build this space

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.250 
would just continue to build this space
and<00:03:53.000> again<00:03:53.750> this<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:55.120> most<00:03:56.120> simple<00:03:57.049> thing

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
and again this is the most simple thing

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.759 
and again this is the most simple thing
that<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:58.129> can<00:03:58.430> create<00:03:58.819> on<00:03:59.150> your<00:03:59.209> bead<00:03:59.599> loom<00:03:59.840> so

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
that you can create on your bead loom so

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.379 
that you can create on your bead loom so
you<00:04:00.829> would<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.160> continue<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.700> build<00:04:02.060> the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
you would just continue to build the

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.170 
you would just continue to build the
base<00:04:02.569> of<00:04:02.930> whatever<00:04:03.889> project<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.669> that

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
base of whatever project it is that

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.720 
base of whatever project it is that
you're<00:04:05.510> working<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:06.019> if<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.919> ring<00:04:07.250> let's

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
you're working on if it is a ring let's

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.849 
you're working on if it is a ring let's
take<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> look<00:04:08.180> at<00:04:08.299> that<00:04:08.470> what<00:04:09.470> you're<00:04:09.590> going<00:04:09.799> to

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
take a look at that what you're going to

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.099 
take a look at that what you're going to
end<00:04:09.919> up<00:04:10.190> doing<00:04:10.340> at<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.730> end<00:04:10.879> is<00:04:11.359> that<00:04:11.989> you'll

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
end up doing at the end is that you'll

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.280 
end up doing at the end is that you'll
sew<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:13.250> two<00:04:13.459> ends<00:04:13.699> together<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.989> that<00:04:15.139> you

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
sew the two ends together so that you

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.250 
sew the two ends together so that you
actually<00:04:15.530> have<00:04:15.889> this<00:04:16.039> really<00:04:16.370> cool<00:04:16.669> base<00:04:17.260> for

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
actually have this really cool base for

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.589 
actually have this really cool base for
your<00:04:18.680> ring<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.220> then<00:04:19.849> I<00:04:19.880> just<00:04:20.120> want<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.419> show

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
your ring and then I just want to show

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.570 
your ring and then I just want to show
off<00:04:20.810> my<00:04:20.840> really<00:04:21.380> fun<00:04:21.560> bracelet<00:04:21.890> here<00:04:22.219> that<00:04:22.550> our

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580
