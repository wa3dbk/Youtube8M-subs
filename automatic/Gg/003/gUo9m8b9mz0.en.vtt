00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.060 

we're<00:01:25.420> going<00:01:25.630> remote<00:01:25.990> control<00:01:26.440> style<00:01:26.710> right

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
we're going remote control style right

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.880 
we're going remote control style right
now<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> back<00:01:28.030> cat<00:01:28.500> someone<00:01:29.500> else<00:01:29.679> is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
now and in the back cat someone else is

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.690 
now and in the back cat someone else is
controlling<00:01:30.009> it

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.490 

all<00:01:37.149> right<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.450> we're<00:01:37.719> actually<00:01:37.899> turning

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
all right so we're actually turning

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.020 
all right so we're actually turning
right<00:01:38.649> now<00:01:38.799> but<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.100> steering<00:01:39.399> wheel<00:01:39.700> isn't

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
right now but the steering wheel isn't

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.370 
right now but the steering wheel isn't
moving<00:01:40.329> that's<00:01:40.719> something<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.200> didn't<00:01:41.500> know

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
moving that's something I didn't know

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.700 
moving that's something I didn't know
how<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.740> go<00:01:42.950> obviously<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.119> very<00:01:44.420> large

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
how we go obviously this is a very large

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.560 
how we go obviously this is a very large
vehicle<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.490> turning<00:01:46.759> radius<00:01:46.789> seems<00:01:47.360> pretty

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
vehicle the turning radius seems pretty

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.690 
vehicle the turning radius seems pretty
nice<00:01:47.810> we're<00:01:48.229> on<00:01:48.320> kind<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:48.740> helipad<00:01:49.219> area

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
nice we're on kind of a helipad area

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.600 
nice we're on kind of a helipad area
here<00:01:49.969> this<00:01:50.180> concrete<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.229> wheels<00:01:51.439> are

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
here this concrete the wheels are

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.910 
here this concrete the wheels are
surprisingly<00:01:53.140> nipple<00:01:54.140> they're<00:01:54.289> both<00:01:54.560> filled

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
surprisingly nipple they're both filled

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.910 
surprisingly nipple they're both filled
that<00:01:55.610> are<00:01:55.759> not<00:01:55.909> filled<00:01:56.210> with<00:01:56.299> air<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.710> ride

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
that are not filled with air so the ride

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.090 
that are not filled with air so the ride
is<00:01:58.159> obviously<00:01:58.780> quite<00:01:59.780> stiff<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:02.470> I'm<00:02:03.470> living

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
is obviously quite stiff so I'm living

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.850 
is obviously quite stiff so I'm living
my<00:02:04.220> all-time<00:02:04.819> dream<00:02:05.149> of<00:02:06.020> sitting<00:02:06.439> inside<00:02:06.590> a
