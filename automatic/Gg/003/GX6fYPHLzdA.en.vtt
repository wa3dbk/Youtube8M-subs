can<00:00:00.179> you<00:00:00.269> discuss<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.870> genetics<00:00:01.380> of<00:00:01.530> cancer<00:00:01.979> a

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
can you discuss the genetics of cancer a

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.530 
can you discuss the genetics of cancer a
little<00:00:02.399> bit<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.550> lot<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.820> people<00:00:03.120> have<00:00:03.270> it<00:00:03.300> in

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
little bit a lot of people have it in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.650 
little bit a lot of people have it in
their<00:00:03.720> family<00:00:04.170> are<00:00:04.410> those<00:00:04.890> people<00:00:05.390> doomed<00:00:06.390> to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
their family are those people doomed to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.360 
their family are those people doomed to
get<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.990> same<00:00:07.170> thing<00:00:07.470> their<00:00:07.649> parents<00:00:08.040> did<00:00:08.189> or

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
get the same thing their parents did or

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.759 
get the same thing their parents did or
what<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.849> they<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.540> maybe<00:00:10.080> alter<00:00:10.620> their

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
what can they do to maybe alter their

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.360 
what can they do to maybe alter their
genetic<00:00:11.280> course<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.210> try<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> prevent<00:00:12.750> that

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
genetic course and try to prevent that

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.950 
genetic course and try to prevent that
yeah<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.400> don't<00:00:14.580> think<00:00:14.730> they're<00:00:14.969> doomed<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
yeah I don't think they're doomed and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.320 
yeah I don't think they're doomed and
but<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.770> know<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.369> talk<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> genetics

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
but you know to talk about the genetics

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.840 
but you know to talk about the genetics
of<00:00:18.420> cancer<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> talk<00:00:19.350> about

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
of cancer you really have to talk about

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.460 
of cancer you really have to talk about
the<00:00:20.850> big<00:00:21.060> debate<00:00:21.449> that's<00:00:21.900> kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.380> on

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the big debate that's kind of going on

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.529 
the big debate that's kind of going on
in<00:00:22.590> cancer<00:00:22.890> right<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.189> between<00:00:23.539> scientists

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
in cancer right now between scientists

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.009 
in cancer right now between scientists
and<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> big<00:00:26.039> debate<00:00:26.480> surrounds<00:00:27.480> cancer

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and the big debate surrounds cancer

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.859 
and the big debate surrounds cancer
metabolics<00:00:28.710> vs<00:00:29.099> cancer<00:00:29.310> genetics<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
metabolics vs cancer genetics right the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.040 
metabolics vs cancer genetics right the
big<00:00:31.019> question<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:32.460> comes<00:00:32.640> first

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
big question is what comes first

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
big question is what comes first
metabolic<00:00:34.050> abnormalities<00:00:34.530> we're<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> way

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
metabolic abnormalities we're in the way

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520 
metabolic abnormalities we're in the way
cancer<00:00:36.329> cells<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.989> our<00:00:37.050> cells<00:00:37.320> make

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
cancer cells make and our cells make

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
cancer cells make and our cells make
energy<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.980> general<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> genetic

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
energy in general or is it genetic

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
energy in general or is it genetic
abnormalities<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.290> cause<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.219> one

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
abnormalities that cause that which one

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
abnormalities that cause that which one
comes<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.120> right<00:00:43.700> but<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.719> even<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
comes first right but you know even the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.840 
comes first right but you know even the
genetic<00:00:46.770> component<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.430> both

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
genetic component because you know both

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
genetic component because you know both
sides<00:00:48.120> agree<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.780> both<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.230> involved<00:00:49.620> it's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
sides agree that both are involved it's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.170 
sides agree that both are involved it's
just<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.370> argument<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> Wilson's<00:00:51.000> first

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
just it's an argument of Wilson's first

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
just it's an argument of Wilson's first
but<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> look<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> overall<00:00:53.039> even<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but when you look at it overall even on

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
but when you look at it overall even on
the<00:00:54.149> genetic<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.809> things<00:00:55.129> there's<00:00:56.129> two

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the genetic side of things there's two

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
the genetic side of things there's two
different<00:00:56.730> things<00:00:57.149> there's<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.350> somatic

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
different things there's one is somatic

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.959 
different things there's one is somatic
mutations<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:01.520> gene<00:01:02.520> abnormalities

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
mutations that is gene abnormalities

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
mutations that is gene abnormalities
that<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.449> passed<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.260> cell<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> another

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that are passed from one cell to another

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
that are passed from one cell to another
cell<00:01:05.939> during<00:01:06.689> cell<00:01:07.470> division<00:01:07.500> these<00:01:08.010> are

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
cell during cell division these are

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
cell during cell division these are
acquired<00:01:08.580> by<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:08.970> cell<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.689> that's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
acquired by the cell right that's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.219 
acquired by the cell right that's
something<00:01:10.770> totally<00:01:11.189> different<00:01:11.400> than

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
something totally different than

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
something totally different than
germline<00:01:13.229> mutations<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.010> hereditary<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
germline mutations a hereditary a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
germline mutations a hereditary a
hereditary<00:01:15.210> correlation<00:01:16.170> that's<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
hereditary correlation that's when a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.969 
hereditary correlation that's when a
gene<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> passed<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.150> parent<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.900> child

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
gene is passed from parent to child

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
gene is passed from parent to child
those<00:01:19.979> are<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.310> different<00:01:20.340> things<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.060> when

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
those are two different things and when

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.149 
those are two different things and when
you<00:01:21.840> look<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> hereditary<00:01:22.619> connection

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you look at the hereditary connection

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
you look at the hereditary connection
that's<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:23.970> small<00:01:24.240> percentage<00:01:24.659> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that's a very small percentage it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.600 
that's a very small percentage it's
under<00:01:25.200> ten<00:01:25.380> percent<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
under ten percent it's a very it's a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
under ten percent it's a very it's a
things<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.240> five<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> seven<00:01:27.900> percent<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
things like five to seven percent it's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670 
things like five to seven percent it's
very<00:01:28.530> small<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:30.140> when<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.500> also

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
very small and when you look at it also

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
very small and when you look at it also
you<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.189> there's<00:01:32.460> there's<00:01:32.670> research

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
you know there's there's research

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
you know there's there's research
actually<00:01:33.180> showing<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.860> these<00:01:34.860> hereditary

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
actually showing that these hereditary

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
actually showing that these hereditary
connections<00:01:35.970> may<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.840> damaged<00:01:37.259> cell

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
connections may also damaged cell

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
connections may also damaged cell
respiration<00:01:37.619> right<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.700> something

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
respiration right which is something

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.140 
respiration right which is something
that<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.329> definitely<00:01:39.540> control<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> when

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that we can definitely control so when

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
that we can definitely control so when
you<00:01:42.240> look<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.540> overall<00:01:42.810> even<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> do

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you look at it overall even if you do

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
you look at it overall even if you do
have<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.670> hereditary<00:01:44.939> component<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
have a hereditary component you have to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.620 
have a hereditary component you have to
look<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.470> different<00:01:49.829> anti-cancer

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
look at all of the different anti-cancer

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
look at all of the different anti-cancer
variables<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.899> life<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:53.250> people<00:01:53.430> tend<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
variables in life that people tend to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
I think if we're to incorporate more of

I think if we're to incorporate more of
