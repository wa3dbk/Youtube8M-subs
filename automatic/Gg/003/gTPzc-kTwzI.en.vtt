00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
okay so let me show you the the chip and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.589 
okay so let me show you the the chip and

want to help you guys out alright this
is<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> chip<00:00:23.060> let's<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.420> hold<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:32.630> okay

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
is the chip let's see your hold on okay

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
is the chip let's see your hold on okay
this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.320> chip<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.309> came<00:00:35.550> from

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
this is the little chip that came from

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.040 
this is the little chip that came from
the<00:00:36.680> show<00:00:37.680> keychain<00:00:38.520> thing<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:39.989> if

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the show keychain thing I don't know if

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.619 
the show keychain thing I don't know if
you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:42.600> i

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you can see the you know where i

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.130 
you can see the you know where i
soldered<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.570> positive<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.660> negative<00:00:45.719> ends

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
soldered the positive and negative ends

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.910 
soldered the positive and negative ends
of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> wires<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.129> 9-volt<00:00:47.579> battery

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
of the wires from the 9-volt battery

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.330 
of the wires from the 9-volt battery
that's<00:00:49.920> where<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:51.800> here's<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> switch

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that's where they go here's the switch

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.880 
that's where they go here's the switch
push<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> LED<00:00:58.170> wires<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
push that and then on the LED wires that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.549 
push that and then on the LED wires that
you're<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> connect<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> put

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you're going to connect to it you put

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
you're going to connect to it you put
these<00:01:01.710> uh<00:01:02.030> what<00:01:03.030> i<00:01:03.059> did<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> i<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.600> cut<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
these uh what i did is i just cut the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.330 
these uh what i did is i just cut the
ends<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> long<00:01:07.700> long<00:01:09.979> sweaty<00:01:10.979> MIT<00:01:11.189> which

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
ends of the long long sweaty MIT which

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.080 
ends of the long long sweaty MIT which
we<00:01:11.520> call<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> uh<00:01:12.060> i<00:01:12.590> cut<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> metal<00:01:14.549> parts<00:01:14.939> off

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
we call it uh i cut the metal parts off

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.420 
we call it uh i cut the metal parts off
a<00:01:15.119> LED<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.140> long<00:01:16.380> arms<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.990> a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
a LED with long arms on it and just a

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
a LED with long arms on it and just a
basically<00:01:20.430> soldered<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> cover<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.290> i

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
basically soldered and cover them up i

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
basically soldered and cover them up i
don't<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.990> these<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
don't know if you can see these are the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.670 
don't know if you can see these are the
little<00:01:25.409> pins<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:27.110> what<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> basically<00:01:28.409> just

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
little pins and what I basically just

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
little pins and what I basically just
did<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:30.290> uce<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> LED<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.159> has<00:01:32.400> too

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
did is a uce on the LED it has too

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660 
did is a uce on the LED it has too
little<00:01:33.259> connecting<00:01:34.259> areas<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.400> for

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
little connecting areas right there for

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.130 
little connecting areas right there for
the<00:01:35.850> LED<00:01:36.710> we're<00:01:37.710> connecting<00:01:38.100> poor<00:01:38.369> LEDs<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the LED we're connecting poor LEDs and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:50.430 
the LED we're connecting poor LEDs and
then<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:41.630> hold<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.810> second

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.200 

what<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.560> do<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.860> once<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.430> get<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.700> wired<00:01:55.210> you

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
what you do is once you get it wired you

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.630 
what you do is once you get it wired you
connect<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.720> where<00:01:56.960> it's<00:01:57.080> supposed<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.470> go

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.370 

ow

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.420 

I'll<00:02:11.740> pitch<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.400> there

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:25.259 

and<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:16.209> you'll<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:19.079> we<00:02:20.079> got<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.439> light<00:02:24.269> we

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
and then you'll see we got the light we

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.720 
and then you'll see we got the light we
have<00:02:25.390> light

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:42.390 

dim<00:02:32.879> or<00:02:33.879> strobe<00:02:34.269> effect

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.820 

very<00:02:43.400> simple<00:02:43.700> wiring<00:02:44.080> not<00:02:45.080> too<00:02:45.230> difficult

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.540 

solder<00:02:48.830> solder<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.510> where<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.410> original<00:02:52.130> LED

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
solder solder and where the original LED

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.000 
solder solder and where the original LED
came<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.240> where<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.170> plug<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.830> your

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
came in is where you plug that for your

came in is where you plug that for your
LEDs<00:02:55.430> into<00:02:57.580> we<00:02:58.580> get<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.350> good<00:03:00.350> old<00:03:00.500> strobe

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860
