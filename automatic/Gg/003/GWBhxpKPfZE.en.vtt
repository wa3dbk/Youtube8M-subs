 The front 20-millimeter bore they can with a twenties NUK

 Therefore Fraser or a special fitting Bothe advises

 if they have two surfaces, they can equally do without them 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 with the second machine, drill the back ten-millimeter sack hole 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.030
 otherwise they offered only all twenties holes 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.030
 and he is giving 13 after that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.860
 It does not matter which hole won first 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 as long as the templates

 the holes are in October despite are the smallest and there is on the hole 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.000

 only after 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.730
 You can then use the copy connector with a supplement and a hammer in the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.730
 Hammer in holes 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.659
 they can already use the small connectors for the false floor 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.879
