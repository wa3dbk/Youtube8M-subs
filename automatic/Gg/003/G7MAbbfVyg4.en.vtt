it's about a billion dollar resource up
there<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:17.160> don't<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.060> folks

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300

they were sitting one that's how they

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.880 
they were sitting one that's how they
got<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:21.810> cheap<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:22.440> we're<00:03:22.530> talking

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
got it so cheap I think we're talking

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.380 
got it so cheap I think we're talking
about<00:03:23.510> 26,000<00:03:24.510> tons<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:25.080> nickel<00:03:26.239> 14,000<00:03:27.239> tons

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
of copper it's just an astronomical

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.090 
of copper it's just an astronomical
resource<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.959> continues<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.709> grow<00:03:31.890> and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
resource and it continues to grow and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.220 
resource and it continues to grow and
that<00:03:32.670> would<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.269> we<00:03:33.840> haven't<00:03:34.019> heard

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230

anything about this though I mean a

billion dollars worth of resources and
it<00:03:38.580> hasn't<00:03:38.880> hit<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.000> news<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.989> think<00:03:40.200> they're

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it hasn't hit the news you think they're

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.410 
it hasn't hit the news you think they're
trying<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.680> keep<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.010> quiet<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.580> no<00:03:42.120> not

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
trying to keep it quiet or no not

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.910 
trying to keep it quiet or no not
necessarily<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.019> think<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.799> those

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
necessarily I think this is one of those

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.410 
necessarily I think this is one of those
companies<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.489> fell<00:03:44.760> through<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.060> cracks

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
companies that fell through the cracks

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.530 
companies that fell through the cracks
because<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.140> small<00:03:46.500> cap<00:03:46.769> company<00:03:47.540> its

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
because it's a small cap company its

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.050 
because it's a small cap company its
market<00:03:49.019> cap<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.230> fairly<00:03:49.650> small<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.549> doesn't

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
market cap is fairly small so it doesn't

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.550 
market cap is fairly small so it doesn't
make<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.299> onto<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.540> lot<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.959> big-name

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
make it onto a lot of a big-name

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.100 
make it onto a lot of a big-name
investors<00:03:53.280> lists<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.299> therefore<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.989> know

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
investors lists and therefore you know

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.199 
investors lists and therefore you know
it<00:03:55.320> just<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.860> kind<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.280> gets<00:03:56.430> overlooked<00:03:56.940> when

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
it just it kind of gets overlooked when

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.660 
it just it kind of gets overlooked when
these<00:03:57.480> big<00:03:57.840> companies<00:03:58.049> like<00:03:58.290> alkane<00:03:58.860> gets<00:03:59.190> you

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
these big companies like alkane gets you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.199 
these big companies like alkane gets you
know<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.970> spotlight<00:04:00.390> see<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:02.010> how<00:04:02.820> long<00:04:02.880> will

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
know the spotlight see so how long will

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.759 
know the spotlight see so how long will
it<00:04:03.269> take<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:04.110> bring<00:04:04.230> these<00:04:04.470> new<00:04:04.620> resources

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
it take to bring these new resources

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.740 
it take to bring these new resources
into<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.400> market<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:05.910> more<00:04:06.120> importantly<00:04:06.540> how

into the market and more importantly how

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.449 
into the market and more importantly how
long<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.320> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> take<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.920> small<00:04:08.130> cap

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
long is it going to take this small cap

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.680 
long is it going to take this small cap
to<00:04:08.580> break<00:04:08.760> even<00:04:08.910> i<00:04:09.180> mean<00:04:09.330> its<00:04:09.480> not

to break even i mean its not

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.840 
to break even i mean its not
inconsiderable<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.709> expense<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.250> bringing

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
institutional fundraising that means

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.100 
institutional fundraising that means
it's<00:04:22.470> currently<00:04:22.919> debt<00:04:23.340> free<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.720> taking<00:04:25.020> a

it's currently debt free so in taking a

look at that you have to take a look at

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.450 
look at that you have to take a look at
how<00:04:26.940> quickly<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:28.590> drilling<00:04:28.890> program<00:04:29.190> can

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
how quickly the drilling program can

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.400 
how quickly the drilling program can
advance<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.450> current<00:04:30.750> drilling<00:04:31.020> program

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
advance and the current drilling program

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.460 
advance and the current drilling program
could<00:04:31.650> last<00:04:31.950> through

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
could last through

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.890 
could last through
what<00:04:32.530> midsummer<00:04:33.010> or<00:04:33.280> perhaps<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:34.270> middle

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
what midsummer or perhaps the middle

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.060 
what midsummer or perhaps the middle
part<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.410> third<00:04:35.590> quarter<00:04:35.920> of<00:04:35.950> two

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
part of the third quarter of two

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.840 
part of the third quarter of two
thousand<00:04:36.640> seven<00:04:36.820> after<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.320> original

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
thousand seven after that the original

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.070 
thousand seven after that the original
acquisition<00:04:39.850> paper<00:04:40.150> said<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.690> production

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
acquisition paper said that production

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.800 
acquisition paper said that production
could<00:04:41.410> come<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.820> less<00:04:42.820> than<00:04:43.090> seven<00:04:43.510> years<00:04:43.540> I

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
could come in less than seven years I

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.540 
could come in less than seven years I
think<00:04:43.990> that's<00:04:44.440> going<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.130> very

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
think that's going to be a very

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.880 
think that's going to be a very
conservative<00:04:46.180> estimate<00:04:46.810> because<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.650> thing

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
conservative estimate because the thing

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.220 
conservative estimate because the thing
with<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.220> new<00:04:48.490> project<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.690> they<00:04:49.840> this

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
with this new project is that they this

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.660 
with this new project is that they this
project<00:04:50.620> can<00:04:50.740> be<00:04:50.770> worked<00:04:51.100> on<00:04:51.250> year-round

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
project can be worked on year-round

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.360 
project can be worked on year-round
which<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.270> can't<00:04:52.480> say<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:53.710> same<00:04:53.740> thing<00:04:54.160> for<00:04:54.310> a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
which you can't say the same thing for a

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.550 
which you can't say the same thing for a
lot<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.670> other<00:04:54.820> Canadian<00:04:55.300> minds<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.200> in

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
lot of other Canadian minds so in

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.140 
lot of other Canadian minds so in
working<00:04:56.980> at<00:04:57.040> year-round<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.700> expect

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
working at year-round I expect

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.000 
working at year-round I expect
production<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.810> come<00:04:59.020> in<00:04:59.200> probably<00:04:59.740> in<00:04:59.830> less

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
production to come in probably in less

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.280 
production to come in probably in less
than<00:05:00.160> half<00:05:00.220> of<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.730> scheduled<00:05:01.180> time<00:05:01.420> oh<00:05:01.660> so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
than half of that scheduled time oh so

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.450 
than half of that scheduled time oh so
that's<00:05:02.410> what<00:05:02.590> you're<00:05:02.650> saying<00:05:02.860> as<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.980> catalyst

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
that's what you're saying as a catalyst

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.690 
that's what you're saying as a catalyst
in<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.850> meantime<00:05:04.330> before<00:05:04.660> all<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.110> these

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
band that they discovered in this area

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.310 
band that they discovered in this area
was<00:05:23.740> thought<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.040> be<00:05:24.190> about<00:05:24.520> ten<00:05:24.880> or<00:05:25.330> tens<00:05:26.140> of

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.590 
was thought to be about ten or tens of
meters<00:05:26.650> thick<00:05:26.919> new<00:05:27.550> data<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:28.150> showing<00:05:28.450> that

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
meters thick new data is showing that

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.590 
meters thick new data is showing that
that<00:05:29.020> band<00:05:29.320> is<00:05:29.590> hundreds<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.400> meters<00:05:30.850> thick<00:05:31.090> so

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
that band is hundreds of meters thick so

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.360 
that band is hundreds of meters thick so
the<00:05:31.900> company<00:05:32.260> is<00:05:32.290> able<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.740> increase<00:05:33.070> its
