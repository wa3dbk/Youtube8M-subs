been redesigned these are now larger and
repositioned<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.750> allow<00:00:45.960> for

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
more airflow to come through it should

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.970 
more airflow to come through it should
not<00:00:47.850> lift<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.300> much<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.690> speed<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> port

not lift as much at speed the I port
rubber<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.460> been<00:00:50.640> redone<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.239> well<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
rubber has been redone as well but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.110 
rubber has been redone as well but
perhaps<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.289> biggest<00:00:52.440> change<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.699> chin

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
perhaps the biggest change is the chin

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
perhaps the biggest change is the chin

bar<00:00:55.949> any<00:00:56.129> longer<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.699> needed<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:57.120> room

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
bar any longer but they needed more room

pretty dang close to your mouth so these

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
pretty dang close to your mouth so these
steel<00:01:02.010> mesh<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.059> been<00:01:03.090> moved<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
steel mesh this has all been moved to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
steel mesh this has all been moved to
the<00:01:03.629> outside<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> vent<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.920> allows

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the outside of the vent now that allows

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100 
the outside of the vent now that allows
more<00:01:05.519> room<00:01:05.700> inside<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> EPS<00:01:06.659> liner<00:01:06.689> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
more room inside for the EPS liner it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.600 
more room inside for the EPS liner it's
also<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> bigger<00:01:07.590> event<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> EPS<00:01:08.580> liner

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
also a bigger event but that EPS liner

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
also a bigger event but that EPS liner
is<00:01:08.970> farther<00:01:09.240> away<00:01:09.330> from<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:09.689> face<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
is farther away from your face so you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
is farther away from your face so you
have<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.380> space<00:01:10.680> inside<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> an

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
have more space inside here there is an

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060 
have more space inside here there is an
adjustable<00:01:12.930> style<00:01:13.260> vent<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.770> actually

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
adjustable style vent this is actually

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
adjustable style vent this is actually
what<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.310> call<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> mud<00:01:14.820> gate<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> keep<00:01:15.540> mud

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
what they call a mud gate is to keep mud

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.749 
what they call a mud gate is to keep mud
and<00:01:16.290> water<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.740> penetrating<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.580> much

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and water from penetrating not so much

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.399 
and water from penetrating not so much
to<00:01:17.939> restrict<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> airflow<00:01:18.509> since<00:01:19.259> we're

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to restrict the airflow since we're

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
to restrict the airflow since we're
looking<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> bottom<00:01:20.070> notice<00:01:20.340> how<00:01:20.580> close

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
looking at the bottom notice how close

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
looking at the bottom notice how close
this<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.450> each<00:01:22.080> other<00:01:22.290> these<00:01:22.439> cheek<00:01:22.710> pads

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this is to each other these cheek pads

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
this is to each other these cheek pads
these<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.520> been<00:01:23.610> redesigned<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.210> more

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
these have been redesigned to be more

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
these have been redesigned to be more
like<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> rice<00:01:24.869> Street<00:01:25.350> bike<00:01:25.560> helmets<00:01:25.950> so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
like a rice Street bike helmets so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.620 
like a rice Street bike helmets so
they're<00:01:26.460> gonna<00:01:26.549> go<00:01:26.729> underneath<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.420> jaw

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they're gonna go underneath your jaw
