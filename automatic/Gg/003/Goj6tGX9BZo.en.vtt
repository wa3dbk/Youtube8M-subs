to<00:02:21.050> set<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.230> phone<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.830> top<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.430> ball<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.090> guess

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
to set a phone on top of a ball I guess

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.410 
to set a phone on top of a ball I guess
um<00:02:26.450> there's<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> charge<00:02:27.780> an<00:02:27.870> area<00:02:29.000> micro<00:02:30.000> USB

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
um there's the charge an area micro USB

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.620 
um there's the charge an area micro USB
slot<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.880> charging<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:32.940> phone<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.300> guess<00:02:33.480> it

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
slot and charging your phone I guess it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.250 
slot and charging your phone I guess it
can<00:02:33.750> go<00:02:33.930> both<00:02:34.260> landscape<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.310> portrait<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
can go both landscape and portrait and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.830 
can go both landscape and portrait and
that's<00:02:37.260> pretty<00:02:37.440> much<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:38.570> all<00:02:39.570> right<00:02:39.690> we'll

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that's pretty much it all right we'll

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.580 
that's pretty much it all right we'll
set<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.140> aside<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:42.330> get<00:02:42.870> into<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.350> meat<00:02:43.530> of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
set that aside and get into the meat of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.660 
set that aside and get into the meat of
it<00:02:44.030> here<00:02:45.590> kind<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.740> weird<00:02:47.100> packaging

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
it here kind of a weird packaging

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.460 
it here kind of a weird packaging
doesn't<00:02:48.420> seem<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.320> very

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
doesn't seem like it was in there very

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.100 
doesn't seem like it was in there very
well<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> charging<00:02:50.820> orb<00:02:50.940> itself<00:02:51.330> we

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
well here is the charging orb itself we

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.150 
well here is the charging orb itself we
will<00:02:52.230> set<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.410> aside<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.769> now<00:02:54.769> down<00:02:55.769> here<00:02:55.800> we

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
will set that aside for now down here we

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
will set that aside for now down here we
have<00:02:56.370> another<00:02:56.810> USB<00:02:57.810> charger<00:02:58.970> similar<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
have another USB charger similar to the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.930 
have another USB charger similar to the
one<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.330> comes<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:02.340> nexus<00:03:02.700> 4

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
one that comes with the the nexus 4

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.150 
one that comes with the the nexus 4
basically<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:03.959> us<00:03:04.320> being<00:03:04.500> there<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.010> top

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
basically just us being there in the top

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.750 
basically just us being there in the top
and<00:03:05.459> then<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.390> plugs<00:03:06.660> into<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.830> regular<00:03:08.459> power

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and then it plugs into a regular power

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.390 
and then it plugs into a regular power
outlet<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:10.820> micro<00:03:11.820> USB<00:03:12.230> cable<00:03:13.310> can't<00:03:14.310> get

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
outlet a micro USB cable can't get

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
outlet a micro USB cable can't get
enough<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.670> these<00:03:14.790> things<00:03:14.940> now<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.209> I've

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
enough of these things now that I've

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.220 
enough of these things now that I've
switched<00:03:15.600> over<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> Android<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.530> seem<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.280> be

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
switched over to Android I seem to be

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.150 
switched over to Android I seem to be
needing<00:03:19.230> them<00:03:19.320> scattered<00:03:19.739> around<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.980> house

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
needing them scattered around the house

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.030 
needing them scattered around the house
the<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.000> nexus<00:03:21.360> 4<00:03:21.630> was<00:03:21.840> never<00:03:22.110> really<00:03:22.350> great

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the the nexus 4 was never really great

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.039 
the the nexus 4 was never really great
on<00:03:23.190> battery<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:24.540> really<00:03:24.690> struggle<00:03:25.019> with

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
on battery it's really struggle with

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.110 
on battery it's really struggle with
battery<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.739> new<00:03:25.950> update<00:03:26.459> came<00:03:26.850> from<00:03:27.000> my

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
battery that the new update came from my

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.390 
battery that the new update came from my
phone<00:03:27.330> today<00:03:27.480> android<00:03:28.410> 4.2<00:03:28.980> point2

phone today android 4.2 point2

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.250 
phone today android 4.2 point2
apparently<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.970> was<00:03:30.060> supposed<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.810> improve

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
apparently it was supposed to improve

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.910 
apparently it was supposed to improve
performance<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:33.110> improve<00:03:34.110> battery<00:03:34.350> life<00:03:34.560> so

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
performance and improve battery life so

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.160 
performance and improve battery life so
we'll<00:03:35.070> see<00:03:35.220> how<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.400> works<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.720> plug

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
we'll see how that works out this plug

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.539 
we'll see how that works out this plug
seems<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.530> lot<00:03:37.680> shinier<00:03:38.070> than<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.430> that

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
seems a lot shinier than the one that

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.690 
seems a lot shinier than the one that
the<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:40.320> came<00:03:40.500> with<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.860> nexus<00:03:41.190> 4<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.610> this

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the that came with the nexus 4 and this

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.789 
the that came with the nexus 4 and this
is<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.030> god<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.360> gloss<00:03:42.840> plastic<00:03:43.620> finish

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
is the god of a gloss plastic finish

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.770 
is the god of a gloss plastic finish
versus<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.580> regular<00:03:45.330> matte<00:03:45.570> plastic

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
versus the the regular matte plastic

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.039 
versus the the regular matte plastic
finish<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.410> came<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.860> phone<00:03:47.780> i<00:03:48.780> had

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
finish that came with the phone i had

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.750 
finish that came with the phone i had
the<00:03:49.140> hardest<00:03:49.500> time<00:03:49.590> trying<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.220> get<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.549> off

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
the hardest time trying to get this off

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.610 
the hardest time trying to get this off
when<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.420> first<00:03:51.600> got<00:03:51.780> my<00:03:51.840> phone<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.350> breaks

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
when I first got my phone is just breaks

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.430 
when I first got my phone is just breaks
apart<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:54.030> we'll<00:03:54.300> just<00:03:54.360> um<00:03:54.840> skip

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
apart like that so we'll just um skip

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.120 
apart like that so we'll just um skip
that<00:03:55.560> part<00:03:55.620> there's<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.099> plug

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
that part there's a plug

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.630 
that part there's a plug
and<00:03:57.280> here<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.360> nexus<00:03:58.690> orb<00:03:59.490> plastic<00:04:00.490> here

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
and here is the nexus orb plastic here

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
that is to it try plugging it in here

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.870 
that is to it try plugging it in here
somewhere<00:04:22.470> I'm<00:04:23.470> going<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.650> plug<00:04:23.890> right<00:04:24.460> over

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
somewhere I'm going to plug right over

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.450 
somewhere I'm going to plug right over
here<00:04:25.180> off<00:04:25.330> camera<00:04:25.980> hopefully<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.070> cables

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
here off camera hopefully the cables

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:42.500 
here off camera hopefully the cables
long<00:04:27.700> enough<00:04:40.020> it's<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:41.440> barely<00:04:41.770> long<00:04:42.040> enough

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
long enough it's just barely long enough

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:55.390 
long enough it's just barely long enough
and<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:44.680> goes<00:04:44.890> in<00:04:45.190> like<00:04:45.820> that

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.219 

and<00:04:55.520> basically<00:04:56.270> just<00:04:56.690> set<00:04:56.840> your<00:04:56.960> phone<00:04:59.229> right
