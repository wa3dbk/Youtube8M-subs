00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.370
 at product shoots with hard 

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.440
 slender shadow is not 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.510
 always possible with whitening or 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.279
 small lighting effects the necessary depth 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.619
 to keep in the pictures 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.680
 Here the processing becomes essential 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.660
 easier if with two corresponding ones 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.820
 Exposures are being worked on 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.490
 at the recordings on congruence 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.150
 and for harmonious transitions in the 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.010
 subsequent composing may be 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.500
 also a soft mark of the masks 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.930
 but we need to see it with us 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 coordinated exposures in a few 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.360
 minutes of such a composing with 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.840
 perfect sound results first 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.450
 I show them the two shots 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.450
 here the bottom is my base recording 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.830
 this is the recording we 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.820
 have photographed with a very hard 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.910
 spot almost from above around this shadow 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.949
 this network of donors mug 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 really often underground too 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.369
 project 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.350
 of course, we went in the foreground 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.690
 very much drawing in the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.340
 pain is lost and so have one 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.410
 second shot made with the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.860
 photographed much softer light 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.250
 has been 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.680
 I'll just fool you and you 'll see 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.369
 already much softer light that 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.800
 Light came from the left front and so got 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.860
 We draw in the pain and also 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.530
 into the grid 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.620
 what we still have to do is the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.390
 to bring together two recordings 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.800
 At first, I'm blind to the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 upper level a few times on and off to 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.550
 Check if the two really 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.190
 I can match that as well 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.410
 reach over the opacity here 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.950
 I slowly pull down and 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.450
 then see if the pictures maybe 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.970
 jump something but they do here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.190
 not at all and that's the way it is 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.259
 really very easy so i have here 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.479
 worked very well at the recording 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.700
 so the cameras really do not 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.580
 has moved 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.570
 Now I can go to the upper level 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.430
 add plane mask and I do that 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.430
 with a pressed old button so with it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.470
 the plane mask becomes fun and fun right away 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.110
 Now I can with a white one 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.750
 foreground color of a brush tip 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.930
 which should be very soft and the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.269
 corresponding size here the donors 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.420
 again I think that's what I'm doing here 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.390
 with a power of 30% and start 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.840
 now to paint here at times by silver 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.010
 and you already see that the pens 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 Very very concise again 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.880
 the fore come and also the red again 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.540
 lights where I come now once the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.730
 Recording with the light from day to day 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.570
 and then we come here too 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.400
 lattice the drawing as we behind the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.799
 donate here at this recording 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.820
 I can now have shadows here as well 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:16.600
 clear the edges a bit and clear 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.090
 then you see that in the background that 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.239
 inside of the cup slightly darker 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.160
 and that does the picture really well 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.930
 if I darken something here because of it 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.630
 because actually something more concise 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.730
 so far that was my first step 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.830
 and they see how fast it works here 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.140
 to adjust the pictures 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.260
 and the next step would be here now 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.780
 down in the edge of the cup too 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 to draw some drawings 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.920
 I take a little smaller brush 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.070
 tip for but with a little more 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.080
 opacity and try now down here 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.090
 to do something free if that's too 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.860
 a lot is not a problem at all though 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.740
 I'll see something here in the first place 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.170
 individual happens 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.520
 wonderful so and now I have here 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.680
 somewhat exaggerated 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.420
 Now I'm just going with black 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 foreground color out here below 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.860
 Of course we are not allowed to have white ones 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.370
 have areas because that's yes 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.250
 Now I'm going to shade this one 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.750
 simply shade with black color 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.410
 back there 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.660
 and let only the lights go I still 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.270
 a little bit bigger at that the covering power again 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.820
 strong back that I'm so close to 20 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.150
 percent but then i can do this here 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.770
 edge also darken a bit again so 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.780
 So we have the two recordings 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.210
 brought together we have them 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.030
 coordinated and I dazzle 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.850
 now the top one out again and 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.730
 then you see what happened how much 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.710
 dynamics as in the picture have which sound 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.890
 value ranges we reached suddenly 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.720
 and maybe it's all in all 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.430
 a bit too strong, but that is not 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.400
 problem I now just go again 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.470
 on the upper level and change the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.170
 Covering a little bit so that 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.330
 we only have about 80 90 percent here 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.370
 and then life is not quite like this 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.560
 massive and does not quite come like that 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.600
 superficially out if I do not 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.300
 I am sure that I am this mask 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.970
 maybe a bit too hard 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.340
 then we have now painted the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.190
 possibilities up here in the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.900
 Features this mask a bit more 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.490
 to change the density I would in 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.770
 allow each case 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.030
 but I would a soft knew 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.950
 Install in the mask 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.940
 and now, in principle, the mask 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.040
 soft enough, that's enough 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.990
 even that's perfectly alright 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.360
 I can close and am now 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.430
 I'm sure that no here 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.170
 very hard edges more in the mask 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.240
 are 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.670
 that was a very quick one 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.250
 easy editing with two 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.100
 the coordinated recordings 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.110
 we can assemble together like that 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.550
 to achieve optimum tonal values â€‹â€‹without 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.640
 Build up complex light sets 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.640
 have to
