00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 In this video, a little about painting coverage 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.769
 varnish sometimes a picture is necessary 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.949
 varnish especially the picture 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.380
 sandy several layers on which like 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.580
 the rule is obtained occur such 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.029
 lived and and places not uniform gloss 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.210
 and so on lacquer evens out shine 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.899
 the picture gives such gloss in addition 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.079
 he brings out the color and tone of the picture itself 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.050
 there is a depth of oil painting besides 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.200
 This varnishing protects against hydrogen sulfide 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 in the air from which the colors darken 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 over the years 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 oil paints and some plus 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.149
 varnishes protects against ultraviolet radiation 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 solar ultraviolet is some 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 species that are labeled 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.899
 of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.789
 filters uv filter here are varnishes 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 it is necessary to take fresh 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.110
 no less since issue date no less there 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.520
 3 not more than half a year is the maximum otherwise 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 it will give tackiness after drying 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 Here I have a lot of pictures and reworked 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.270
 because of this, the picture seems to have dried up 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.170
 varnished but still gives off sticky 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 does not stick 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 dust is from old varnish varnish should be 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.740
 let fresh old paint on the painting 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.770
 add paint here in this case 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.920
 we take dammarny varnish it is warm warm 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.079
 shade and over time it still turns yellow with 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 over the years and they accordingly need 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.540
 cover works of warm tones like here 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 This he even with time can give 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.310
 some kind of nobility painting here 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 we put 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.159
 certain measure and rub the usual 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.159
 sponge foam preferably fresh 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.310
 light tone to notice in time 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.590
 some blurred paint that was washed away 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.530
 solvent present in lacquer 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.160
 sometimes it happens if not sustained 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.800
 for drying paint for good 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.110
 generally need all the rules 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.110
 varnish no earlier than one year 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.640
 after writing a picture 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.290
 but modern paint it concerned 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.420
 old paint is a very modern paint 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.530
 robust in them there are desiccants in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.540
 some of them they will quickly dry powerfully 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.090
 i cover some pictures and through 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.709
 a couple of months like this paint job 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.080
 it becomes very good especially in summer 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.190
 they dry quickly but need good 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.200
 wait at least six months here and on 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.459
 bright lips can be seen here if 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.130
 suddenly some paint a little bit 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.989
 blurred thinner here spreads 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 can be done in parallel movements 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.739
 can circular as you please especially on 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.959
 such textured painting optional 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.540
 you can align masks as you like 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.870
 do on thumbnails actually method 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.290
 there planning lacquer their miniatures 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.010
 swab is made cotton swab in a piece 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.579
 gauze and dip the tampon and circular 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.109
 movements in miniature 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.560
 It is varnished like this 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.280
 against the window or the lamp looks 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.250
 window reflection 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.390
 picture that there were no missing places and 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.160
 wiped and blocked up the picture 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.270
 Before this, I have of course already cleaned 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.410
 brushed as you saw the palette knife from 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.470
 any extra roughness but in general 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.600
 old paintings that year hung her 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.770
 need to wash the headlamp desirable weak 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.110
 a solution with some water, too, a sponge and 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.060
 dry well then rinse 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.660
 water and dry to avoid greasy 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.640
 Places can be even some weak 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.290
 thinner type of it and now it's 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.630
 a little bit if the picture 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.740
 you know some fat places 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.239
 present wipe so here now 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.910
 I will show the vertical size of the brush as 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.799
 it is also here so get off 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.100
 roughness that's knocked roughness 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.420
 cleaned prepared for varnishing 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.760
 varnishing in this case is possible and 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.800
 brush preferably flutes 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.020
 I regretted my usual construction 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.140
 brush the main thing that it was new you can 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.390
 here and so shoot down the falling hairs 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.010
 good pull to pull 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.350
 It was then a struggle with a pile of varnish coat 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.870
 like this in this case acrylic washing 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.820
 he is bright liquid in contrast to the ladies 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.680
 arnova dammarny thickish by the way 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.980
 dammarine can be diluted small 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.460
 the amount of pinene and if in varnish 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.890
 add one to one pinin varnish will 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:05.380
 quite matte it is also possible 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:08.620
 effect and when matte varnish to achieve 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:13.070
 adding up to 100 percent 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:17.420
 pinena turpentine artistic here 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.260
 poured into a suitable container in more 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.980
 convenient of course pick up the capacity varnish 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.380
 acrylic washing 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.800
 acrylic pistachio washing creed 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.060
 pistachio they are very bright varnishes 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.990
 rainy very good for light 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.419
 works remarkably transparent 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.550
 waterproof film from them here and so 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.490
 here pounded in the same way 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.000
 vertical carry lacquer too 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.720
 desirable to look at the light 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.310
 great work with this in this way 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.110
 blocked by plots is taken let's say 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.780
 the far left is broken down into 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.770
 square about and blocked because 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.300
 that the lacquer is grabbing fast enough 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.400
 need to lacquer before sticking to 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.760
 sticking such a lung sticking 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:10.060
 brushing especially in summer 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:13.160
 grabs a brush that is necessary 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.410
 work fast but quickly still very 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.300
 important point fast but not faster than what 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.630
 I do you now if 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.690
 waving the brush even faster varnish will 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.300
 to trap air and will be like 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.970
 white stripes present as 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.010
 would taking lather would lacquer if 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.870
 drive faster it is very important 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:39.260
 brush or sponge need so moderately 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:42.950
 spend so here so look at 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.680
 skylight yes here I will not consider 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.850
 Of course there are still any varnish sprays 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.700
 matt varnishes 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.180
 here just two types of lacquer most 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.130
 common varnishing varnishing 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:01.160
 Looks like this in the bathroom 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:04.750
 carry dust from dirt and not all 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.750
 on this all subscribe good luck
