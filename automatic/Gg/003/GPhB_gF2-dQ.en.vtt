00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so people a short update video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.379
 regarding louis arena further castle resp 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.639
 a last update video now but 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.700
 right at the beginning I would like to see the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.500
 question the questions answer the some 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.289
 of you have been for some time or 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 who have no facebook anyway and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.740
 Although the releasedatum band is ok 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.250
 finally going on yes in a few days already 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.279
 on the third of March 2014 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.240
 let's start with louis arena head castle 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 I already have some struggles 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.829
 recorded and hope you are looking forward to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 Definitely cool fights though 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.399
 there is still a little update yet 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 a ruleset no fear is nothing 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.520
 bad on the contrary is even something 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.440
 what is good for you and you have to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 nothing somehow there now again 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.030
 change over like the last time and that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 I have weeks after three games 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.199
 noticed that the clinical form 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 with these rules as they are now much 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.530
 too difficult because it is too 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.780
 eight pokémon almost impossible each team 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.100
 Quasi as the problem even 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.589
 auszukontern 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 that's why there is now an addition and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.799
 you can do it like it used to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.210
 forecast makes the case was you 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.430
 continues to earn, however 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
 works differently and that their 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 you have to have two arena leaders in a row 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.680
 defeat if you get defeated 2 then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 her a continuum against those weak 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.560
 he have just lost again 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.400
 take time as such'm assuming 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 you fight wins against psycho and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.970
 fight and then lose in the third fight 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 against electro then you are allowed 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.090
 use continuo and is expected again 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.350
 this must be done against electron 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.680
 but also really directly the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.659
 be the same leader if you still 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.250
 times loses ye indeed pitch came 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.600
 almost when he wins the fight then 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 fourth loses then you are too 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 out because it applies this one continue 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.750
 means you can have four in total 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.250
 earn continues 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.140
 this is no longer the case with the top 4 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.880
 so if you beat the eight arena 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.320
 have and the top 4 page and say 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.149
 you only have one conti left then 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.770
 generally a continuum then you are allowed 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.509
 lose once in the top 4 and then 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.740
 no longer on when your three top 4 one 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.049
 I conquered that I hope that we in 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.450
 biological around you somehow 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.789
 understandably understandable I explain it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 once again defeated two in snow 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.140
 Arena Ladder tries for an extra too 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.000
 get the needed extra-trial 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.770
 the same areal are against 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 we just fought off the top 4 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.030
 you can not win any more 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.040
 maximum you get so four continues 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.240
 and I want to emphasize her again 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.860
 Maybe that's what you think 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.959
 To take it easy believes me that is 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.670
 This rule was not urgently needed 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 because I somehow I can always do it 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.340
 emphasize that has nothing to do with that 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.260
 I someday your skills but 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.790
 Not at all, it 's just easy man 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.270
 have to look at the twelve times 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.160
 winning matches in a row already being one 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.569
 only small mistake resp 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.890
 not only a mistake sometimes you have yes 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.050
 also just bad luck because it is so far 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.459
 pokémon yes that can also be part of it 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.170
 then about victory and defeat 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.420
 decide and I personally think so 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.459
 pity because I can only motor it 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.060
 I want to camp and not see them 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.340
 only one 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.570
 so these little bonus rules the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.239
 everything else stays for you 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.590
 the old one 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.170
 And then I want to be in this form too 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.660
 directly announce the upload plan 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.730
 which will be valid from next week monday 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.480
 is always changing and there is 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.299
 from Monday to 16.30 comes a sweet following 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.060
 arena ladder castle and arrives at 18.30 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.329
 pokémon heartgold on the second day then 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.510
 So on Tuesday comes at 14.30 zelda 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.600
 Majora's mask at 16.30 comes fire emblem 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.760

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.310

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.820
 4.30 pm in Ratzeburg and at 18.30 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.820

 at 14.30 zelda at 16.30 fire emblem around 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.680
 38 5 goals and then always in the change 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.150
 you can deduce yourself how 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.739
 that then probably goes on in the reason 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.989
 taken not much will change only the 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.959
 himself celebrate virtually simultaneously and 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.549
 comes at two hours crazy pokémon 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.040
 heart gold comes every day especially 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.350
 remained 16:30 every day just celebrate 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.500
 only myself mean I am at 14 30 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.030
 slipped and also at a glance 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.049
 but before that was there is now in 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.070
 Lauterburg hope that was understandable 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.850
 and so that was all I wanted 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.140
 wanted to succeed 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.100
 look forward to it as we said we are 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.750
