 annamaria franzoni love me forever about the 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.129
 current tv my feet 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.299
 hello my name is games it is necessary to insert sky cancellation April 2 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.490
 therapists aba our Indian speedline test laboratory the revolutia 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.210
 tessier mai festa which we submit our wheels to 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.929
 this to verify the private quality of marked meetings 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.089
 it will be my right if our new machine buzzes to buy the 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.670
 tires 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.140
 It is composed of a drum of 32 with a diameter 36 of a length 960 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 free 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.210
 however we can with two nights text riding at around 54,000 then 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.540
 as you can see the machine housed I had to turn it on 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.150
 lately with a fireplace if I cited only once. 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.229
 these are different on this real wall 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.679
 with peeled surface with specific evidence of deception 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.789
 it is sometimes considered a little shorter, about 2 meters in width and if 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149
 the word caterpillars triangular section 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.780
 about three-quarters high with a particular hotel surface 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 bevelled and 45 degrees from the peak 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.900
 we use photoshop to simulate the visual impact of the fear profile 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.990
 however as possible to see some times they are placed in vertical plus star 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.630
 near angled months 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 we can test a singular variation of more or less than 10 degrees 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.360
 obviously the prolonged cool desio likes rear wheel in which 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.010
 we have different geometry from france 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.240
 baseball jam obviously research on stress altering we find out if we can 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.409
 you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.409
 identify faults this blind love 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.820
 internatinal we make of the cured heads that we call cancellara texts ho 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.040
 bull head 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 whose we can simulate a very intense sprite and a quick climb into 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 speed 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.830
 shaking the back vault on one side has another 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.180
 at an angle of plus or minus 10 free while we take the lead 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.260
 evenings as I have already mentioned the old standard six-hour standard at 12 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.139
 kilometers per hour of speed 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.249
 adamis you followed these macro directions after finding that we would have 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.519
 could continue the test and continuously for weeks without 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.440
 sea â€‹â€‹clothes 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.000
 if holidays are interrupted even without breaking anything 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.450
 we have modified the protocol now we detest about 40 kilometers per hour 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.800
 25 minutes an hour for our American friends and it takes about 40 o 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.109
 cot to start seeing small budget problems 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.229
 waters. will replace mirages and continue with the heads until break 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.249
 definitive this was clear 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.599
 alabiso generate damage of some kind in short tremors we do not understand how 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.709
 we can improve our products 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.579
 we test for as long as it takes for you it takes 1 2 weeks 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.609
 even at accelerated speeds 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.599
 the good thing about producing test products for the mind 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.370
 and that we can complete the projects within a few days because if 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.340
 we consider the speed resistance test combined also with other types 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.129
 of heads 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.180
 it is possible to finish shortly a new laminate but nice 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.620
 innovative materials improve our products or not 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.689
 yes they keep unchanged. the disorders get worse 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.550
 artÃ¹ and in any case with online msns

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.069
 I'm graduated 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.269
 said what to do if the machine for the loans the fact 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.680
 the machine seems to be very simple headaches we carry out are 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.109
 absolutely complex and reliable especially with regard to 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.599
 cooking mode 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.349
 this summer summer allows us two of the breakup modalities we see 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.949
 in the reality of the sector 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.529
 we have a series of weights on pato cart a couple of different shapes between 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:47.249
 Christians this. to simulate bari typology impact point from buffet a 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.449
 porphyry cubes

 fidal impact. a curb 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.150
 it will be the fault of time that the Marseillaise leaves 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.939
 date for a central impact 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.549
 the text takes place this way we fix the position times we knock a tire 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.969
 deflated you can see we have made a mass made book 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.399
 we have gravitational acceleration and then we have the same in which it occurs 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.299
 torture 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.379
 let's start calculating the impact he gave at a distance of orthopedists from the surface 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.100
 of the rubber 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.890
 this is what I call the distance mum we give you the impact point and let's go 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.769
 forward until the break 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.999

 novotel katy perry 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.349
 let's now hope about 16 inches from the surface of the vault a point where 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.120
 sometimes, other brands available on the market would begin to break 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.280
 during the development of carbon technology we have done about 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.180
 140 different visions of the lamina and now we have arrived at the resistance 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.680
 of the time truly unmatched 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.900
 calls are already so many of the fact that it won't be something 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.200
 problematic for this time but could easily cause 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.610
 problems for other market cracks 1 hour 1 pramuk horror breakthrough 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.400
 mail a new account 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.580
 we arrived at the question of the alphabetical - machinery 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.370
 designed specifically to test a series of components of the past but 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.169
 also the brake pads 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.409
 we are in the simpaty boat of brake pads since 2003 and not 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.740
 we never talk about evaluating new tablets 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.790
 their extra performance dissipation and the general life of the 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:58.819
 circle 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.669
 we have wav files purchased at the bite connected from the found a flywheel 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.509
 large enough that it weighs about 191 pounds 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.909
 we can run it from 0 to almost 50 miles per hour 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.300
 the purpose of the system is to simulate the weight of an athlete the frame 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.289
 about 195 books the slope of about 12 degrees and the speed I mentioned 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.139
 before 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.559
 actually every day we record a series of data 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:27.579
 pinato we have a caliber via monviso actors of dynamic load there 

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:30.969
 returns the braking force data as you dress 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.169
 peeing above the pneumatic activation we have another meter 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.710
 this calculates the cable tension 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.310
 both of players are willing to pull because it allows us to notice 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.280

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:14.919
 for example 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.449
 these two above are two firm pair direct contact 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:19.930
 insert pads 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.830
 and that we use to monitor the temperature of the tablets themselves 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.500
 here instead we have thermocouples new contact that we use for 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:31.029
 monitor the temperature of the rim 

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:35.239
 we can use this technique to measure the db civita the constancy and the 

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:36.199
 lack 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:39.550
 of various surface treatments on different circles 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.819
 to ensure we have reliable and consistent data 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:45.819
 we can start with the test let's take a look
