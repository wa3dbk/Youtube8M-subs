00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
cords a little bit stretchy compared to

the<00:00:21.689> other<00:00:21.810> cords<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.289> we've<00:00:22.410> looked<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.710> so

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
the other cords that we've looked at so

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.269 
the other cords that we've looked at so
far<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.759> got<00:00:24.029> notes<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.869> opposite<00:00:25.800> sides<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
far it's got notes on opposite sides of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.279 
far it's got notes on opposite sides of
the<00:00:26.340> neck<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.700> each<00:00:26.820> other<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.270> personally<00:00:28.259> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the neck to each other and personally I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
the neck to each other and personally I
found<00:00:28.590> G<00:00:28.860> chord<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.880> hard<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.270> I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
found G chord really really hard when I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.030 
found G chord really really hard when I
was<00:00:30.539> learning<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.930> was<00:00:31.320> only<00:00:31.439> pretty<00:00:31.739> little

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
was learning I was only pretty little

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.260 
was learning I was only pretty little
when<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.460> learning<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:32.940> fingers<00:00:33.239> were

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
when I was learning and my fingers were

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720 
when I was learning and my fingers were
pretty<00:00:33.600> short<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.710> still<00:00:34.980> possible<00:00:35.219> no

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
pretty short but it's still possible no

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.220 
pretty short but it's still possible no
matter<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:36.090> little<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:37.050> still

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
matter how little you are it's still

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
matter how little you are it's still
possible<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.710> play<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> G<00:00:38.219> chord<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
possible to play a G chord but it is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
possible to play a G chord but it is
going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.840> bit<00:00:40.020> stretchy<00:00:40.320> so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
going to be a little bit stretchy so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740 
going to be a little bit stretchy so
let's<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> close-up<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> look

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
let's get to a close-up and have a look

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.100 
let's get to a close-up and have a look
at<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.129> new<00:00:44.129> chord<00:00:47.180> okay<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.240> here's<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.810> close

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
at this new chord okay so here's a close

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.960 
at this new chord okay so here's a close
look<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.470> our<00:00:49.590> G<00:00:49.860> chord<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.730> see

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
look at our G chord and as you can see

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.490 
look at our G chord and as you can see
we've<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.540> bit<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.960> stretch<00:00:52.230> here

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
we've got this bit of a stretch here

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.860 
we've got this bit of a stretch here
between<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.100> second<00:00:54.060> and<00:00:54.120> third<00:00:54.239> fingers

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
between the second and third fingers

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540 
between the second and third fingers
that's<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> nasty<00:00:55.650> bit<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.950> was<00:00:56.130> talking<00:00:56.489> about

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that's the nasty bit I was talking about

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.690 
that's the nasty bit I was talking about
there<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.150> it's<00:00:58.110> not<00:00:58.290> too<00:00:58.590> hard<00:00:58.950> but<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
there so it's not too hard but it's a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.819 
there so it's not too hard but it's a
fairly<00:01:00.329> difficult<00:01:00.510> chord<00:01:01.290> when<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> first

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
fairly difficult chord when you first

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
fairly difficult chord when you first
start<00:01:02.130> at<00:01:02.280> least<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> found<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
start at least I found it was so so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770 
start at least I found it was so so
let's<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.350> through<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:05.189> bit<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.780> first

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
let's go through one bit at a time first

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
let's go through one bit at a time first
of<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.530> finger<00:01:08.070> second<00:01:08.820> fret<00:01:09.000> fifth

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
string not particularly difficult that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.749 
string not particularly difficult that
one<00:01:11.790> reaching<00:01:12.689> over<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.310> second<00:01:14.310> finger

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
one reaching over now second finger

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that that's nice and round and that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
that that's nice and round and that
you're<00:01:19.979> using<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.430> fingertip<00:01:20.940> if<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.540> too

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you're using the fingertip if it's too

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
you're using the fingertip if it's too
flat<00:01:22.049> you'll<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.409> muting<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.010> strings

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
flat you'll be muting all the strings

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.020 
flat you'll be muting all the strings
and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:24.120> here<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.770> 3rd<00:01:26.100> finger<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and then here with the 3rd finger is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.539 
and then here with the 3rd finger is
happy<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.140> down<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> thinnest<00:01:29.130> string

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
happy to go down on the thinnest string

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.719 
happy to go down on the thinnest string
at<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.880> 3rd<00:01:30.119> fret<00:01:30.770> now<00:01:31.770> there's<00:01:32.310> quite<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> few

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
at the 3rd fret now there's quite a few

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
at the 3rd fret now there's quite a few
common<00:01:33.240> problems<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
common problems with this one first of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
common problems with this one first of
all<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.740> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> people<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.640> trouble<00:01:35.880> with

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
all a lot of people have trouble with

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
all a lot of people have trouble with
positioning<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> third<00:01:37.170> finger<00:01:37.409> they're

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
positioning of that third finger they're

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
positioning of that third finger they're
either<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.330> too<00:01:39.540> round

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
either like this where it's too round

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.750 
either like this where it's too round
and<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.590> finger<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.040> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.369> pushing<00:01:41.729> down

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
and the finger is kind of pushing down

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.370 
and the finger is kind of pushing down
that's<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.540> pushing<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> string

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that's going to be pushing the string

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's going to be pushing the string
off<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.130> fingernails<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.760> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> be

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
off and the fingernails are going to be

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.060 
off and the fingernails are going to be
getting<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> way<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.049> solution<00:01:46.260> here<00:01:46.950> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
getting in the way the solution here is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.940 
getting in the way the solution here is
bringing<00:01:47.880> those<00:01:48.090> knuckles<00:01:48.689> back<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
bringing those knuckles back around a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
bringing those knuckles back around a
little<00:01:50.159> bit<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.520> they're<00:01:50.670> back<00:01:50.909> underneath

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
little bit so they're back underneath

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240 
little bit so they're back underneath
the<00:01:51.540> fingerboard<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the fingerboard a little bit more that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
the fingerboard a little bit more that
should<00:01:53.580> straighten<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.210> finger<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
should straighten that finger up at the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.170 
should straighten that finger up at the
same<00:01:55.950> time<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:56.400> very<00:01:56.460> important<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
same time it's very important that this

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.749 
same time it's very important that this
one<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.570> round<00:01:57.930> enough<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.159> muting<00:01:59.610> all

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
one is round enough not to be muting all

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
one is round enough not to be muting all
of<00:02:00.090> those<00:02:00.299> notes<00:02:00.659> underneath<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:02.009> we

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of those notes underneath because we

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.710 
of those notes underneath because we
really<00:02:02.460> need<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.820> getting<00:02:02.939> those<00:02:03.240> three

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
really need to be getting those three

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.840 
really need to be getting those three
strings<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> middle<00:02:04.650> open<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.610> making

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
strings in the middle open so making

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.700 
strings in the middle open so making
sure<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> other

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
sure that it's not this that's the other

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.350 
sure that it's not this that's the other
common<00:02:08.129> thing<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.519> finger<00:02:08.939> being<00:02:09.119> too

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
common thing is this finger being too

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.920 
common thing is this finger being too
flat<00:02:09.689> so<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:10.590> sure<00:02:10.769> that's<00:02:10.950> nice<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.370> round

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
flat so make sure that's nice and round

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.539 
flat so make sure that's nice and round
now<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.349> go<00:02:13.470> through<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.920> play<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.430> day

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
now if we go through and play it one day

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.979 
now if we go through and play it one day
at<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> time<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.239> know<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.780> should

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
at a time as you know that you should

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.440 
at a time as you know that you should
when<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> practice<00:02:16.790> first<00:02:17.790> notes<00:02:18.060> shouldn't

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
when you practice first notes shouldn't

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
when you practice first notes shouldn't
be<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> problem<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.379> can't<00:02:19.769> imagine<00:02:19.890> why

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
be a problem that I can't imagine why

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.000 
be a problem that I can't imagine why
you<00:02:20.310> might<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.819> trouble<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.450> note

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
you might have a trouble with that note

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.680 
you might have a trouble with that note
ii<00:02:23.010> know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
ii know

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.570 
ii know
sometimes<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.080> problem<00:02:25.500> because<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
sometimes this is a problem because the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.270 
sometimes this is a problem because the
second<00:02:27.030> finger<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.170> touching<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
second finger is here is touching the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.400 
second finger is here is touching the
fifth<00:02:29.550> string<00:02:29.880> just<00:02:30.150> at<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.330> point<00:02:30.510> so

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
fifth string just at that point so

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.350 
fifth string just at that point so
that's<00:02:31.680> quite<00:02:32.250> common<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.240> be

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that's quite common for that to be

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
that's quite common for that to be
happening<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.890> need<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
happening but it's not right you need to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.190 
happening but it's not right you need to
get<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.520> fit<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:35.850> second<00:02:36.420> finger<00:02:36.570> rounder

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
get that fit that second finger rounder

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.370 
get that fit that second finger rounder
to<00:02:37.680> free<00:02:37.950> up<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.280> fifth<00:02:38.640> string<00:02:39.020> now<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
to free up that fifth string now the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.760 
to free up that fifth string now the
next<00:02:40.650> string<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.420> D<00:02:42.420> string<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.410> sounds

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
next string the D string if it sounds

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.410 
next string the D string if it sounds
like<00:02:43.890> this

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
like this

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
like this
it's<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.560> ringing<00:02:46.770> up<00:02:47.010> properly<00:02:47.490> it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
it's not ringing up properly it's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's not ringing up properly it's
because<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.030> underneath<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> first

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
because the underneath of the first

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.110 
because the underneath of the first
finger<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.740> blame<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.610> need<00:02:50.790> again

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
finger is to blame so you need again

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180 
finger is to blame so you need again
need<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.330> get<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.690> first<00:02:51.959> finger<00:02:52.350> working<00:02:53.100> on

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
need to get the first finger working on

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.350 
need to get the first finger working on
to<00:02:53.340> its<00:02:53.490> tip<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.880> little<00:02:54.120> bit<00:02:54.240> more

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
to its tip a little bit more

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.240 
to its tip a little bit more
G<00:02:56.960> and<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.140> B<00:02:57.170> strings<00:02:57.620> are<00:02:57.770> usually<00:02:57.950> okay

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
G and the B strings are usually okay

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.550 
G and the B strings are usually okay
with<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:58.670> chord<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.150> then<00:03:00.140> we've<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.320> got

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
with this chord and then we've just got

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.460 
with this chord and then we've just got
to<00:03:00.650> make<00:03:00.680> sure<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.330> note<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.600> good<00:03:02.840> some

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
to make sure that that note is good some

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.230 
to make sure that that note is good some
people<00:03:03.830> for<00:03:04.010> some<00:03:04.040> reason<00:03:04.250> try<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.940> put<00:03:05.120> their

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
people for some reason try and put their

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.960 
people for some reason try and put their
third<00:03:05.480> finger<00:03:05.870> pipe<00:03:06.200> back<00:03:06.560> far<00:03:07.280> away<00:03:07.580> from<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
third finger pipe back far away from the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.550 
third finger pipe back far away from the
fret<00:03:08.210> I'll<00:03:08.360> learn<00:03:08.450> exactly<00:03:08.690> know<00:03:09.080> what<00:03:09.290> causes

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
fret I'll learn exactly know what causes

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.050 
fret I'll learn exactly know what causes
that<00:03:09.830> but<00:03:10.010> it's<00:03:10.130> definitely<00:03:10.160> not<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.580> good<00:03:10.760> idea

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
that but it's definitely not a good idea

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.970 
that but it's definitely not a good idea
but<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.810> remember<00:03:12.170> me<00:03:12.320> talking<00:03:12.500> before

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
don't want to go into that it makes it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.759 
don't want to go into that it makes it
kind<00:04:02.239> of<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.510> really<00:04:02.780> good<00:04:02.930> one<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.350> learn<00:04:03.470> in
