00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.629
 the modality of the activity that we are going to carry out the following weekend 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.889
 how much it will cost us is to say how much we have to pay the track for the 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.109
 use of it its responsible 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.969
 and whatever is inherent in the club I want it to have to do with the 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.729
 motorsport that is what moves us to others 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.000
 in account we started meeting with all Sundays 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.150
 this 9 in the morning to three in the afternoon 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.960
 but because of the fact that on Sunday many people prefer to sleep we decide 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.020
 pass it for Saturday the 13th we made three Sunday 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.389
 the practice 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.709
 and the last session we did on Saturday since last week 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.290
 from two in the afternoon until four in the afternoon since the jump 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.550
 barrier has about a month working inside the circuit 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.229
 yes but the gestation of the highest levels I had before that 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.340
 let's start rolling we are giving everything 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.819
 until we finally achieve 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.659
 after selling the idea all the 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.939

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.090

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.930
 spreadsheets 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.880

 meeting in london 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.840
 It is worth clarifying practically what affects one of the practices for 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:32.590
 warm up the road course when that moment arrives doors inside what time and 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.589
 with the way the competition is done within the circuit 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:38.920

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.749

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.749
 at another time to all sides time 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.300
 and the sessions are individual 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.539
 or at a distance to avoid that the cars can be found in the pillory in a 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.469
 accident 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.909
 to avoid also the coma that is bad of peking 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.709
 so that in situations that are provided for there to be accidents said 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:14.439
 Carlos Barrón 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:18.369
 after this session ends where we practically run so 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:19.749

 in individual practice 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.309
 and they make a race of 4 5 laps 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:39.169
