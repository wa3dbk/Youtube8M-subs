00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 The goal is at the base of the kiss. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:13.880
 With me it is at the base it spoke to me and it told me 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.880
 said 'it has not rain since g 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:23.260
 The kiss is good and everyone still likes it. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.000
 more in the case of carnival five 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.300
 party days 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.529
 new people it's clear that everyone wants 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.020
 Kiss but it's worth the hint Kiss in the mouth 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.540
 can transmit from a simple flu 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.290
 or cooled to more serious diseases 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 like hepatitis and tuberculosis 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.330
 the alert for the carnival period 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.670
 when people kiss 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.530
 unknown partners is the clinician 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.720
 general and professor of the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.620
 medicine of the federal university of sÃ£o

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.140
 doctor bernardinho geraldo if you are 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.239
 with bleeding, the risk still increases 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.399
 more the doctor said 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.600
 according to him diseases can be 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.360
 transmitted by the oral or nasal cavity 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 respiratory viruses can be 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.130
 transmitted by kiss on the flu flu 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.060
 meningitis tuberculosis apps are the most 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.940
 and also mononucleosis a 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 illness that starts with fever and 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.429
 body and can progress to hepatitis or 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.369
 inflammation on the bass explains the teacher 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.050
 the dark and united environment is conducive 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.190
 for the development of several 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.770
 bacteria 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.590
 according to the dentist surgeon 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.800
 silvio giannini in the mouth for more than 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.259
 thousand different bacteria, not counting 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.380
 that are unknown and bad breath 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.569
 may be indicative of these bacteria or 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.690
 of some throat infection 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.399
 poor dental conservation is another factor 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.310
 which increases the probability of 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.470
 disease transmission 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.619
 however observe the appearance of the person 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.380
 being kissed is not always enough to 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.720
 avoid the risk because some 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.630
 diseases can be transmitted 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.940
 even if they are not in the acute phase 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.760
 clear that if it is in the acute phase the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.310
 transmissibility is greater but for 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.660
 example if the influenza virus is in the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.660
 person 1 before the
