00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.570
 Horny daniel dal hans has a text age t 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.340
 shirt on 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.340
 that is already one 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.760
 make android consoles soon 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.360
 Playstation 4 and Xbox when it bursts yes 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:39.300
 clear 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.300
 do they do it for reasons of several 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.860
 Well, first you hear that you are so too 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.750
 say I have not had one for a long time 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.370
 bought more for a console game 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 although I actually console player 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.949
 am 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.050
 they just cost me so much money 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.420
 but buy more every week 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.309
 mobile games because they cost a 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.820
 few euros and they do just that much 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.650
 fun 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.150
 the graphics are partially not yet on 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.140
 arrived at the level where will be too 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 better and better 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.940
 So I get a lot more for the money 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.780
 and the performance of Luke good point 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.760
 it's true you get more for the money 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 the question is still if you are 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.940
 real gambler is you want the better 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:24.939
 graphic years a braid and the fifa on 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.470
 different smartphones and now have 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 I once again back on the xbox fifa 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:35.980
 gambled is a bit hornier 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.310
 So that's pretty much who cares 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.660
 horny the little boy will be too 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.540
 always better when we are with us 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.150
 nvidia entertain on the computec the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.520
 what the next generation will be able to do 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.630
 because eat really fat graphics processor 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.130
 from his computer 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.120
 Of course I put that on TV 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.490
 is not it as cool as that ? 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.510
 computer I mean that's exactly that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.130
 point firm so you still need it 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.230
 once in a nutshell but then you have to 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.970
 then again calculate what 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.380
 Of course I could do that 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.590
 say I have the computer one way or the other 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.290
 but is not it that way 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.000
 android consoles against a Younger 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.849
 would like to buy younger target audience and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.819
 then back to the computer of the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.140
 is dependent on parents 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.640
 probably yes and me when the die 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.349
 parents probably will find it too 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.209
 not so great when you sprout 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.450
 the whole time somehow call of duty 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.110
 the computer calculator claps and there 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.099
 any types can be rented 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.349
 is so I so I think that the 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.360
 already a market for it are all must 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.370
 already we have to have parents too 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.620
 stand behind it and that and understand it 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 this concept and that is 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.220
 probably not always that 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.319
 the console comes out but it is a 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.330
 gigantic step forward that is possible 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.799
 even further and then there is cloud 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.489
 gaming if the internet connection like that 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.200
 are fast 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.150
 daniel is a very smart type cloud 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.769
 gaming it is right the right one 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.049
 approach I think because there goes 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.400
 at some point the journey 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.870
 but there is also no longer pricing 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.510
 so interesting there are always up 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.690
 any monthly patterns 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.349
 Pay for it every month and then it will 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.599
 probably a bit too 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.610
 expensive 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.049
 then there will be much better graphics 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.879
 somewhere on any server 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.190
 Calculated on my TV 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.260
 and I have everything I want and that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.370
 even cheaper 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.930
 agrees daniel but it is still missing 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.959
 much is missing the bandwidth and 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.410
 now comes the we throttling limit 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.480
 know yes the telekom wants the vdsl 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.750
 Throttles and I would like to then 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.069
 Let's see how you get high-quality graphics 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.250
 playing in the middle of the telecom connection 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.540
 that will be interesting because 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.459
 then the problems in that you here 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.380
 not coming right or 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.569
 maybe even then the telekom comes 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:08.049
 and itself such games offering and 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.049
 preferred their own services 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:20.389
 now I'm curious what to be 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:21.049
 I have to say especially since I stop 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.210
 not the right one 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.550
 Passionate hardcore bender 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.320
 i am in real time strategy so can 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.229
 more so the strategy is this 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:37.600
 mastermind behind the plans daniel ohl 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.600
 Violence, we are used to it 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.190
 can android consoles xbox playstation 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:54.360
 and co competition make mine 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.800
 answer is no you can not me 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.870
 I'm not a big console player 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.250
 but rather a real-time strategy 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.180
 genre 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.909
 say starcraft with starcraft 2 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.240
 anyway, if you look at projections 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:13.409
 look at it from nvidia it is so that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 the really cool graphic games 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.650
 all about a second hardware in the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.669
 background in and get the whole 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.960
 only streamed is right in the case of 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.250
 I need a nvidia chip for it 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.889
 actually a computer with 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.909
 ideally nvidia graphics card understands 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:32.580
 but like I said that 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.860
 can even run from the cloud come as 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.520
 there are already the first first provider the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.229
 experiment with it and then you need it 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.759
 I only have the small console 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.639
 and the internet connection fast 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.719
 Enough is around the fat video signal in 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.779
 to play my hands 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:51.270
 So that means everything is graphic intensive 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.979
 That's not going to be on the console 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.120
 changed there but comes from the 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.310
 other box I have to me then 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.430
 anyway, then do not buy anymore 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.229
 and what else comes in one 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.460
 interview with the map webbing of nvidia 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.229
 spoken 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:12.629
 the next or next generation 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:16.460
 t grass will have the graphics power 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:18.779
 in his words, the right one now 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.060
 have graphics cards in the computer and that 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.490
 integrated on this little storm 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.080
 boss will speak on the processor one 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.000
 android game console rems 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.440
 android smartphones and then i need 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.639
 maybe not even more cloud 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.460
 Gaming around the dates in decent 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.879
 quality and full hd nicely pose too 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.029
 can 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.289
 she is still a fat battery it 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.529
 maybe everything comes in one 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:46.110
 cheaper but still the games 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.629
 now microsoft and sony and such 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.339
 This will be carried forward annually 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.100
 the boys will be here too 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:55.670
 follow suit and they will 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.790
 set new standards again 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.130
 right but these new standards 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.890
 they will become sinful again 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.380
 be expensive say I'll be 40 50 again 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:11.940
 spend euros on a game 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:16.230
 and at android or ios i can 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.720
 for 1 23 euro really cool games with 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.050
 phenomenal fun to play by 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.410
 therefore android consoles are nice 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.640
 gimmick pathetic beautiful things too 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.640
 but do not compete really 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.600
 now he was los angeles is cancer 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:42.260
 Noise day over need a tinnitus 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:45.090
 and will not be snatched in your case 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.620
 the marketing manager of microsoft and 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.380
 sony because they are happy about 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.810
 your statement I'm not there yet 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.550
 so sure what it looks like so 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.550
 I 'm curious what you say
