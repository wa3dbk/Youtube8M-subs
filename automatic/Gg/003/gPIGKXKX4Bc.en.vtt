00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.700
 lunch and we find the other 500 x 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.660
 in front of a bx 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 that's what the theory of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 car evolution at the ddt 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.769
 Father Ipsc almost thirty years ago 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 must be true 90 25 next 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.920
 ace a sonic this is a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.289
 little car look we have 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.359
 the impression that the 500 is capable of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.189
 ride on on the flea car and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.540
 affine sagging on his suspensions 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.000
 hydropneumatic but his excesses in one 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000
 wink you understand 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 what has become mass management 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 look at the physical mass of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 500 it's true all the horrors 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.450
 which is meant to be reassuring of a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 single room and da costa 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.590
 look at the bx on the print all 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.330
 the pieces will get boned will fall 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 while this is not the case it was 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.440
 it was but that's how we got 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 worked on the northern ferret 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 last thing I repeat it all the time 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.720
 but look what was the height of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 Snare you can drive 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.420
 the elbow at the door 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 what makes cars or there was 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 an absolutely extraordinary visibility 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 canton maneuvering all that was 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.170
 great because opened on the big 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.119
 this was true of cars 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 look today at the height of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.759
 crate she and she is a lot more 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.250
 high 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.660
 so it's really 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.660
 we forgot because it's more 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.070
 concern in the nineties saleh 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.120
 work and safety and make 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.120
 safer cars 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.200
 so we were built like that of 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.220
 ddd to go up the doors we have 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.570
 reworked adjustments to give 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 of course made absorbing areas there 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.680
 is a physical reality but also the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.350
 design elements for for here at 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.890
 appear strong appear powerful 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.930
 muscular look at it the smallness ddt and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.970
 this from the bumper all that looks 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:06.220
 frail and there you have something that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.600
 wants to be massive not the word but it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.380
 would be interesting to see that really 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.980
 there we instantly have the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.980
 comprehension
