00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.690
 games 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.060
 a cup of sugar 1 cup of sugar 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.310
 a teaspoon and a spoonful of 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.750
 yeast , this recipe is very 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.600
 It's easy just to mix these 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.810
 ingredients and put the forum to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 first we will put the flour in the 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.800
 sugar that 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.190
 the eggs 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:15.830
 and butter and let's stir the chocolate 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.570
 we will put it last because 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.570
 otherwise the heat of the hand will melt 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:37.620
 when it has this texture here 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.670
 people are going to put the chocolate is 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.920
 ready now to put the chair in the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.140
 people use two spoons and need to leave 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:02:02.400
 well away from each other because they will 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:04.380
 to melt the baking sheets are 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.950
 with buttered paper I learned not 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.720
 stick on 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
 now I will put in the oven is already pre- 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 heated to 200 degrees for about ten 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.940
 minutes 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.740
 have to keep track of it is good 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.540
 as it begins to look golden in the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.780
 I'll show you how it got wet. 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.469
 I left a chair here to show 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.030
 For you, how does it get me melted? 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.430
 well then you have to expect to cool well 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.739
 to take but he will only dismantle 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.609
 You can take it the way I have it. 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.609
 very cold 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.980
