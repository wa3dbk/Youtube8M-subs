00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.830
 ae 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.580
 the goal 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.580
 O 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 the trumpet is one of the most 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.540
 world remains touching 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.910
 even today there are records of paintings 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.040
 Egyptian aly days were found two 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 copies of the instrument in the tomb of the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.670
 pharaoh tutankhamun which means that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.020
 has at least three thousand and three hundred 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.210
 years 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.520
 the first trumpets were made with 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.610
 different materials like everything from sugarcane 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.140
 bamboo wood bone shell and only in the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.500
 average age is that they will become 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.239
 produced with the metals in 1815 occurred 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.790
 the creation of the valve system by the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.320
 German rene x tosel this system was 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.239
 very important because it has 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 closed the totally chromatic trumpet 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.430
 performing more musical scale notes 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.400
 in a way the trumpet has always been 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.680
 connected to people and important events 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.020
 announcing the arrival of authorities of the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.060
 Kings also cited the armies in the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.680
 wars through fanfare and this 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.979
 it was reflected in the repertoire 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.979
 symphonic 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.860
 the construction of the trumpet and modern 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.840
 involves the mouthpiece 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 Daddy, why are you here? 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 met the shorter trumpet more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.930
 sharp it is the general tuning pump 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.659
 here we have the first piston 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.640
 second they are in the 3rd that are this 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 Thin valve notes are related 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 the first is the second but it is more fixed 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.149
 This is the third family of the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.829
 trumpet is quite large depending on the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.450
 repertoire of composers of the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.310
 trumpet player has a whole set of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.079
 instruments that he can use in the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.509
 baroque music such as trumpet in 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.910
 another pet piccolo that aquino menorzinho 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.130
 has a very strong performance where 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:22.380
 noted composers as ba 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:24.239
 seeing the telemann rival among others is 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.489
 important to mention that we trumpet 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.650
 promise the exhibitor or for some reason 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.569
 reason and has his notes in the score 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.459
 different height from the one that really 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.739
 I am and this is very interesting because 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.109
 generates an entire sound search that only 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.790
 will use that style to follow a 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.400
 sheets of muse for example writing 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.350
 for trumpet do not necessarily be 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.959
 played trumpet of what can generate 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.959
 countless changes in the boss's sound 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.490
 we have as accessories né surdinas 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.250
 which changes a sound of the instrument as 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.350
 most commonly used by the suit 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.610
 Forget me, I'll give you some examples here. 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.180
 this stranger says the thin is not anymore 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.180
 metallic 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.040
 we have here hua hua 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 in that which is made funny 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.270
 We have to narrate moré that until 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.100
 some musicians call the sly 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.100
 husband of them by the characteristic sound 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.310
 We camp on the sly that make only one 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.940
 little used until much used in the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.940
 villa-lobos songs 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.810
 and finally we are planning, right? 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:45.000
 It has an economic effect also one 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:46.380
 Screaming person yelling is always a 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.120
 challenge playing trumpet and orchestra 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.889
 because there is always a 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.139
 very required instrument we have 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.639
 to study and specialize and almost 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.280
 what kind of a week do you 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:05.699
 plays the mpb jazz series in the other only plays 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:08.220
 mahler's symphony , for example in 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.199
 It's true, I started learning cornet that 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.270
 it is rather that the trumpet is so the 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.620
 machine was eight years old that 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.389
 I was studying in a school that had 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.000
 music was in my dad's car I saw 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.160
 a Frenchman named morresse andré who already 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.139
 died but recorded everything you 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.940
 think of a trumpet and even a certain 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.250
 other instruments on the trumpet one 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.169
 great competition with 12 years the garden 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.110
 music school I then went in because 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.150
 this young woman I went to see is that the very thing 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.620
 in this world of music to act in a 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.539
 Symphony orchestra, right? 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.099
 I think music is this relationship with com 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.289
 the sound of the instrument I initially think 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.180
 that this really only brings the music 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.340
 Pet center I already heard that it has nothing 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.340
 for free, sorry for the other colleagues
