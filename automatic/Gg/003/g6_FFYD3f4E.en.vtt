you're working with something like a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.860 
you're working with something like a
carrot<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.200> know<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:40.580> can<00:01:40.820> grow<00:01:41.000> about<00:01:41.180> six

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
carrot you know it can grow about six

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.360

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
really gets in there and fertilizes it

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.340 
really gets in there and fertilizes it
and<00:01:48.880> then<00:01:49.880> your<00:01:50.240> bed<00:01:50.390> is<00:01:50.510> prepped<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.050> this<00:01:51.200> is
