 it will turn out well but letting you 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850
 screensaver flew 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.340
 30 seconds of thinking okay better like this 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.649
 This is an absolutely standard purchase. 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.670
 no different from 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.119
 any subscriber's online show off in 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.220
 than cons phantom assassin 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.740
 do you want a tank agree 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.500
 he will be able to kill me easily with prokast 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.590
 I can kill him so 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.410
 unlikely fund mind go to no such 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.350
 prokasta like a park is far from lutheran 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.970
 and I can only kill him while kicking 6 o 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.620
 what does it say i need to be fine 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.560
 delight creeps 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.260
 my first ability is very little small 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.630
 little mono cost so i will 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.350
 it is often possible to use straight 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.270
 among only 30 mana in class 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.930
 Montana is worth as well as using shift 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 can come out of it if I want and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.260
 she's good you see he ripped off me 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.290
 49 with his hand 54 to 5 but none the less 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.110
 gods fails carrying what types 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.880
 Better by the way, I write release 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.590

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.530

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.150
 i like tinoi types 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 somehow until I will not yet download the second 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.640
 spell jump on until it makes sense i 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.410
 so think so far with a hit at all 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.240
 I have no problems yet 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 3 passivka helps me live too 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.950

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.880
 try to aggress on him even 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.190
 spike zayuzal 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.860
 I think he needs me 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.800
 act a little more aggressive 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.380
 try to push the line to me 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.510
 Battle came and I went quietly with 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 control hands look 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.590
 I want to buy it in battle I myself 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.330
 brought 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.840
 the same time I, I was buying in full straight 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.750
 on the chair 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.569
 I push the line he is afraid of me afraid that I 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.209
 I jumped on him start to cut his face 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.700
 and I will start to cut his face only 6 lava 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.830
 look how he fears me okay 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.350
 masculine i don't be afraid go hit me i 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.120
 I should give a gift I prefer 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.590
 phantom assassin collect 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.280
 phases see how good pak is to play 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.280
 this plan that 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.610
 He can yuzhe zilch to calmly leave 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.800
 and i'm for now no danger now 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.840
 I imagine because I do not have 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.000
 teammate 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.280
 phantom assassin begins to fight and be 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.190
 some sort of heavy rival 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.060
 only after she takes her 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.810
 sixth low 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.730
 there are 6 lava you can try to jump if 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.890
 I would more let us collect the cutters 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.860
 quietly from the trains i think i society 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.220
 so much dirt passive guy gives us 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.940
 very good good understanding of what is at 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.940
 somewhere near 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.860
 luck and only 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.450
 Do not hesitate to expose 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:10.420
 sand on somewhere near here i see no 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.459
 he sits quietly here 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.500
 do not have to ship yourself shoes 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:29.560
 brought at least now the most start 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:29.560
 I wonder what kind of creed flew bad 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:53.690
 botal interest in elements he walked 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:56.389
 home well i'm really here dominated 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.550
 that is, I kind of farm passively learn 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:03.290
 ran there for runes back and forth something 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:10.160
 distracted by talking 37 to 10 7 minutes 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:16.880
 and he already left 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:22.039
 why is he not having his hands shaking 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.310
 hesitated see shy know to 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:29.380
 that percent I did not have any 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.380
 problems about such a mask at parties 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:38.380
 oh look how tasty try how 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.780
 beautiful but arpu blows me down 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.210
 very much and after a couple of levels he has 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.520
 will be the most maximum 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.060
 power nyukov and he can kill me 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.060
 very easy 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.580
 letter dance 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:05.850
 lithium even the second is not already through him 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.740
 that saved me mask saved me now 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.070
 so quickly caste he erased me 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.980
 but with anyone with any support which 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.580
 would come to the center phantom assassin for 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.040
 dominated really there shouldn't be 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.080
 no problems with the last hit 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.520
 stand on your side carefully 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.010
 look at the map and no 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.680
 no mistakes can be made easily 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.870
 phantom assassin win such a pen 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.870
 how so far very easy 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.650
 I 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.259
 the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.900
 and here so impudent already it is impossible but 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:55.110
 Still, I think that it has some 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.539
 error rights friend arbo 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.320
 saves him easily where he can 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.630
 small 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.910
 and see how it aligns 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.880
 equalize the advantage of what I was right now 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.889
 will be killed so watch look hugged 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.020
 I am attentive here clearly 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.509
 here I am right for the impudent to get under 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.410
 rig jumped something with phantom strike 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:18.860
 see something like that right away 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.449
 neater but I think I showed how to 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.979
 put phantom assassin center hope 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.900
