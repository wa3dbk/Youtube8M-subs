 my videos also wanted to tell in 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.660
 In this podcast, I created the page 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 VKontakte new which I will add 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.440
 all communicate with everyone as in skype 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.970
 he has a lot of contacts to me 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.920
 it is inconvenient to communicate there now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.140
 VKontakte all such vkontakte and will 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.150
 much easier reference I will leave in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 description also guys what he wanted 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.799
 say i open my rubric heading 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.560
 high outcast cleaning well or tick mite 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.350
 I thought what your task will be called 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 write me achivku well can you at least 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.479
 How much do you write your fantasies ? 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.950
 It allows you to write a lot of writing 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.189
 on the left is the topic of VKontakte where you will be 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.909
 I also write the description will throw off you go on 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.119
 ssylochku write me your well your cleaning 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.290
 for example sit and in the opponent in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.090
 competitive mode on the head and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.240
 seconds jump off him and kill him 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.860
 knife or let's say you don't know the block 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.820
 kill from afar and write necessarily 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 guys in what mode and you can even what 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 cannon or no matter how cannon there is 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.200
 wish you can emphasize overall this is your 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.479
 choice and guys ask such achivki 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 so that it is right it was not so that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 there the whole team cut with a knife well you 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.570
 You understand that it is practically 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.329
 unrealistic so here I think rubric 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.130
 will be funny you will like i know 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.290
 that there is a man who is already 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 filmed but he did not unwind due to this 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.630
 idea so i will try to promote this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.550
 idea into the distance 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.400
 so for now no one is so serious 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.160
 It takes ks go errors so I will try 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.910

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.520

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.630
