in a couple minutes when I finally got a

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.279 
in a couple minutes when I finally got a
boost<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.060> should<00:01:10.240> wait<00:01:10.359> around<00:01:10.539> a<00:01:10.659> bit<00:01:10.840> or

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
boost so you should wait around a bit or

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.050

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.070 

all<00:01:51.910> right<00:01:52.030> finally<00:01:52.480> so<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.690> looks<00:01:52.840> like<00:01:52.960> I'm

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080

about<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.260> get<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.500> boost<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:53.980> just<00:01:54.880> make<00:01:55.090> sure

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
about to get a boost so just make sure

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.120 
about to get a boost so just make sure
you<00:01:55.300> don't<00:01:55.390> miss<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.960> got<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.980> know

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
you don't miss it I got it and you know

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.190 
you don't miss it I got it and you know
as<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:57.850> see<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.210> go<00:01:58.360> very<00:01:58.600> fast<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.170> as

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
as you can see you go very fast and as

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.740 
as you can see you go very fast and as
you<00:01:59.320> all<00:01:59.440> probably<00:01:59.470> know<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.570> once<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.660> just

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
you all probably know and once you just

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.070 
you all probably know and once you just
wait<00:02:01.930> for<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.260> finish<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.420> will<00:02:04.630> see<00:02:04.990> that

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
wait for it to finish you will see that

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.480 
wait for it to finish you will see that
like<00:02:08.080> my<00:02:08.260> score<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.619> multiplying<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.250> lot<00:02:09.369> on

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
like my score is multiplying a lot on

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.520 
like my score is multiplying a lot on
the<00:02:09.610> top<00:02:09.790> right<00:02:10.060> like<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.660> lot<00:02:10.930> more<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the top right like a lot more so you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.350 
the top right like a lot more so you
won't<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.010> wait<00:02:12.130> as<00:02:12.250> long<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.730> look<00:02:13.180> I'm

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
won't have to wait as long and look I'm

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.840 
won't have to wait as long and look I'm
so<00:02:13.570> going<00:02:13.750> fast<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.260> it'll<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.530> forever<00:02:14.850> so

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so going fast and it'll go forever so

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.100 
so going fast and it'll go forever so
it's<00:02:15.940> really<00:02:16.090> great<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.780> don't<00:02:16.990> have

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's really great because you don't have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.830 
it's really great because you don't have
it<00:02:17.350> speeds<00:02:18.250> up<00:02:18.370> your<00:02:18.400> score<00:02:18.850> like<00:02:19.150> five<00:02:19.600> times

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
it speeds up your score like five times
