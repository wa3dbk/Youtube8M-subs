now<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.040> electronically<00:01:05.670> limited<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
now that's electronically limited but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.030 
now that's electronically limited but
you<00:01:06.810> probably<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> go<00:01:07.470> any<00:01:07.619> faster

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you probably don't want to go any faster

looks<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> lot<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> Honda<00:01:14.820> Insight

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990

cooperation there it's all comes down to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
cooperation there it's all comes down to
