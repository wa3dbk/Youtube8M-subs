00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you didn't do a little bit more in the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.150 
you didn't do a little bit more in the
actual<00:02:05.780> game<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:06.319> give<00:02:06.470> her<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.590> red<00:02:06.800> card<00:02:07.039> but

actual game to give her a red card but

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.460 
actual game to give her a red card but
whatever<00:02:07.459> I've<00:02:08.179> seen<00:02:08.450> people<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.899> punched<00:02:09.380> in

whatever I've seen people get punched in

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.430 
whatever I've seen people get punched in
the<00:02:09.679> refs<00:02:10.270> well<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.300> obviously<00:02:11.599> play<00:02:12.080> soccer

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
the refs well I obviously play soccer

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.650 
the refs well I obviously play soccer
but<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.830> refs<00:02:13.069> in<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.880> game<00:02:14.090> are<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.450> tough

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
but the refs in the game are in a tough

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.390 
but the refs in the game are in a tough
situation<00:02:14.870> sometimes<00:02:15.709> they<00:02:16.010> don't<00:02:16.130> think

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
situation sometimes they don't think

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.699 
situation sometimes they don't think
squirrely<00:02:16.849> if<00:02:17.030> anyone<00:02:17.780> punches<00:02:18.260> anyone<00:02:18.590> no

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
squirrely if anyone punches anyone no

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.650 
squirrely if anyone punches anyone no
matter<00:02:18.739> what<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.250> circumstances<00:02:20.030> are<00:02:20.209> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
matter what the circumstances are the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.360 
matter what the circumstances are the
ref<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.050> pretty<00:02:21.319> much<00:02:21.440> inclined<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.190> give<00:02:22.310> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
ref is pretty much inclined to give a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.830 
ref is pretty much inclined to give a
red<00:02:22.640> card<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.180> sure<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.510> will

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
red card so I'm sure this will

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.780 
red card so I'm sure this will
come<00:02:24.050> red<00:02:24.349> card<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.069> you're<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:25.370> she'll<00:02:25.670> be

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
come red card and you're right she'll be

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.960 
come red card and you're right she'll be
out<00:02:25.819> for<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.360> next<00:02:26.690> round<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.620> uh

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
out for the next round that uh

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.400 
out for the next round that uh

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.790 
on Tuesday to face North Korea name yeah
I<00:02:34.640> think<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.480> look<00:02:35.599> they<00:02:35.750> should<00:02:35.989> handle<00:02:36.650> it

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
I think you look they should handle it

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.960 
I think you look they should handle it
between<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.190> different<00:02:37.519> playing<00:02:37.730> pretty

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
between the different playing pretty

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.080 
between the different playing pretty
well<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.239> mean<00:02:38.540> North<00:02:38.810> really<00:02:39.370> good<00:02:40.370> not<00:02:40.849> great

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
well I mean North really good not great

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.839 
well I mean North really good not great
I<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.049> my<00:02:42.370> us<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.519> will<00:02:43.640> end<00:02:43.760> up

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
I think that my us they will end up

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.369 
I think that my us they will end up
winning<00:02:44.060> their<00:02:44.239> division<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.930> they<00:02:45.049> will<00:02:45.230> go

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
winning their division and they will go

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.680 
winning their division and they will go
on<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.190> gonna<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.549> if<00:02:47.120> nothing<00:02:47.569> if

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
on and it's gonna be if nothing if

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.470 
on and it's gonna be if nothing if
everything<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.340> way<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.519> kill<00:02:50.299> that

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
everything it's the way to kill that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.390 
everything it's the way to kill that
could<00:02:50.840> be<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.140> think<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:51.769> in<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:51.980> final
