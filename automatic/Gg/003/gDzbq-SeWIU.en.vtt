00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.340
 well this is the part of windows that 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.290
 we have commented I tell you that they are two 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.690
 videos the first video from show 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.860
 all the ubuntu part that what 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.480
 we have to do 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.070
 ok well in this video I'm not going to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.170
 show how the part of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.510
 files and lester see diocese and then 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.820
 you can download some video 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.770
 tutorial on how you can 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.449
 access with the fall server only 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.340
 let's show here what it does 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.680
 with the hydra part not previously 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 we already have here in our 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.910
 desk in our 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.330
 in our unit 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.030
 our 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.530
 our folders here we have the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.050
 folders that we're going to share I say for 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.910
 that they see that if we are there accessing and 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.000
 as we have told you the other had 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.400
 the testing part we're going to go to the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.230
 part of the users here we 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.240
 well we have the testing part as 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.130
 we have commented it before I say 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.170
 on the other side of ubuntu we already saw that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.170
 we are not given the part of him 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.280
 ok ok if the other does not exist 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.320
 I say this one must the two of you saw them 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.290
 at the same time I go see 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.570
 how are they connecting ok because this 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.980
 let's pay here for a little bit 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.290
 that you see it from the beginning 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.760
 we say yes to it to turn off and 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.070
 we go back to start the service okay 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.600
 we're up by port 21 and we're going 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.840
 to do the same process that we did in 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.120
 I'm going to do the ubuntu part in 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130
 this moment and we are giving you start 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.190
 ubuntu let's see how it starts 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.380
 attack is attacking everything and everything 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.660
 ports though we are seeing is in 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.940
 begins with the use of tests and is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.470
 trying to access then you 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.080
 you can see here on the bottom that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.750
 It does not say it says do not login but it 's the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.420
 part of being attacking I do not say here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.370
 it appears that yes no and at this moment 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.540
 go you can not see it but now 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.730
 this one already threw me the password and then 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.190
 we can see the amount of evidence and 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.660
 idish that is generating and all the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.460
 all the new ones that you are doing 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.930
 then regardless of whether 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.440
 thrown the password and you can already 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.930
 accessing this we see that throws us that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.610
 is offline, but in this case 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.860
 this was how it looks 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.630
 simple the key was not so strong but 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.640
 this one have patience have a lot 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.640
 patience because the bigger it is 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.390
 the dictionary and more complex is the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.330
 so good password we will take a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.720
 little more for good on our part 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.550
 It is all I tell you that this project 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.400
 we did in urgent universities 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.330
 and so good the manager we work in 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.190
 team is my partner erika pineapple and her 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.680
 server juarez that we can support them in 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.840
 something good then we will help you only 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.690
 I remind you that this video tutorial is 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.270
 for 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.090
 and educational purposes only what 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.720
 let's occupy in case we have been 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.130
 forgotten our own localhost 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.470
 our password of our own 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.110
 localhost 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.560
 we did not do any purpose in a matter of 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.810
 hacking then they are simply 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.640
 educational proposals and we can see 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.770
 the educational side of all this is worth 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.510
 then this was the part of windows is 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.459
 quite simple technically this is 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.050
 the server attacked and the part 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.050
 interesting is the ubuntu part 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.010
 and later
