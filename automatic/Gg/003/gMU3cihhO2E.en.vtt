00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 as you know we are getting the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.640
 enough salt or are we 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.170
 exaggerating as you know I distinguished the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.809
 foods that have more sodium than others 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.759
 well there's a table that talks about basses 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.009
 medium and high contents of this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.990
 sodium that does not tremendously wrong and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.619
 before going to that I want to read but I 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 just arrived 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 another data says to link in case not what 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.420
 we know tremendously affects the process 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.250
 of authentication so today 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 the oxidant ones abound because it will be 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.660
 the more salt that has started to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 abound in every type of food 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 even candy for children is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.420
 where they have had to be impacts and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.399
 antioxidants because the salt that oxidizes 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.960
 it comes out of certain ages and you kill yourself 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.399
 finally besides all 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 contrarieties and diseases that this 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.379
 drag well we have a table that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 we will see below is 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.969
 to see how much salt there is in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 food foods with low 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.670
 Sodium content less than 40 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.379
 milligrams cereals flours pasta 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.620
 fresh vegetables and fruits oil sugar 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.740
 sweet natural infusions cookies in 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.020
 salt water 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.360
 non-mineralized drinking that would be like 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.790
 the foods that less that I would have 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.740
 but that however it still contains 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.460
 now foods with moderate content 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.650
 Sodium from 40 to 150 milligrams 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.130
 when you go to the supermarket do 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.600
 the exercise there say moderate 40 150 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.020
 will see that there are some who come to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.470
 400 300 and so good those who have more 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.350
 or less than that without added salt water 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.890
 mineralized milk yogurt cream meats and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.550
 fish and food with towering 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.820
 sodium content 200 milligrams a 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.160
 savory table salt seafood fish and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 other canned food canned 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.850
 cured busy deli meats 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.920
 pickled sauces adn that absence 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.229
 I eat sanito but said so much 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.759
 seasoning that says a lot at the end 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.490
 pages the idea of improving in terms 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.670
 of health commercial broths cheeses on 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 all that was hard bread and cookies 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.440
 snacks and sports drinks product 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.660
 in the cup phase mostly fish 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.510
 seafood in short has a quantity of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.190
 impressive sodium that beyond what 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.550
 that they have say nature the typical 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.730
 tuna to be the one that comes in the car is 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.620
 eliminate the psychic does only now there are 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.390
 things there are things that you can not imagine 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.970
 as for example that the mineral water 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.140
 has sodium and has many holes that's why 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.940
 is that there are some mineral waters that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.790
 they make the difference that is they are without sodium 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.400
 over the others but they have good me 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.610
 Pigram practice yoga I do notice that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.610
 there is 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.010
 let's say to take because you are 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.049
 doing large collective exercise 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.870
 opera tura is a savage is voting 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.120
 and they sell also for some that do not 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.220
 they decide this waters say 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.780
 sports but not only energetic 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.000
 are these waters that make you the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 electrolytes and what the teacher and endure the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.110
 visuals not all of that tells you that the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.549
 offering of the nucleus I took I turned around 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.870
 owes to the amount of salt that has 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.540
 save the thing is going to collapse 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.090
 answer exercise is pulling you 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.470
 water on one side and on the other hand 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.090
 the jump is taking them 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.250
 and while you're sweating let's say 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.170
 can come a swamp or let's say 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.349
 on the contrary what it promises now 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.140
 there is a graph that teaches finally of 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.390
 where does this atrocious amounts come from 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.629
 of salt that we consume daily a lot 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.629
 tension 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.910
 there the lawsuit where the salt comes from 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.340
 we eat 75 percent 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.720
 processed foods will consist of 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.270
 that in the natural at best 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 reactive organic fair 15 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.860
 hundred of foods that we cook 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.200
 obviously there we will take the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.000
 10 percent hats are found 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.430
 naturally in the products and there not 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.740
 There is nothing to do and it is a different type 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.200
 of natural salt that the body once again 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.940
 understands and processes it the strong the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.180
 world health organization I want 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.840
 that they understand something sugar exists in 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.540
 Fruit 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.600
 sugar exists in natural juices 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.700
 and that does not create your teeth 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.220
 for years of evolution is like a dog 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.500
 let's say an animal because he only wanted the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.830
 teeth because we have refined the sugar 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.740
 to the point that the body does not understand 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.780
 what is can not fight it instead 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.070
 the sugar that there is of the fruit and all the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.260
 people let it take power so as not to get fat 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.540
 pp but it is a sugar that even makes you 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.000
 well it is an energy that powers you by 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.590
 a moment the room is the same the salt 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080
 that comes natural 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.270
 in the animal and it is also a product a 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.790
 conductive element of energy also 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.890
 but the salt that we added and once 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.020
 more like sugar the body does not know what 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.630
 do with it is too let's say a 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.610
 leg to the stomach and obviously the 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.500
 stomach cancer asthma out the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.210
 osteoporosis problems and so on 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.110
 etc etc pressure problems what 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.270
 first suspend the game and there is a 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.930
 common denominator between salt and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:10.000
 the sugar is that both contain acid 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.160
 both are acidic and as everything does with 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.260
 exactly in the background reason is that 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.210
 our body is not prepared to 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.890
 digesting acids was practically a 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.330
 pure when you put him was the 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.920
 sir to the food or when we consume 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.720
 sugar in excess what we are 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.130
 introducing are acids to the body 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.540
 that the walls are running 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.040
 intestinal then it is a poison 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.140
 deadly because it's not practically 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.210
 burning inside and as I said 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.770
 when it has been determined that those 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.360
 non- hereditary cancers because it 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.860
 cause that is what the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.010
 biomagnetism for example that changes the 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.880
 ph of the body is to mean the body 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.080
 more than necessary are the acids that 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.270
 I'm helping you but I'm already 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.850
 manners and throwing me salt sugar not 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.800
 I resign and start to say expand 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.240
 for everything and cancer you know where 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.130
 it's fed because soy cancer 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.690
 I have to eat the first thing goes 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.610
 sugar and the reason since it is 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.980
 food and that's why it grows unless 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.540
 has that say he did not prosper now 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.740
 is very clear that graph that 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.940
 you just showed your effectively 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.410
 because suddenly he can tell you that 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.030
 he's eating a lot he went out he says no no he 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.620
 I'm throwing so much salt into the food but 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.900
 if one takes into account and starts to see the 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.150
 label the mineral water absolutely 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.190
 everything has are then clear if one 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.560
 I was consuming many of those 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.720
 foods that come for example 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.850
 processed food is going to have 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.080
 to look for more natural foods and 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.280
 leave the processed foods for 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.530
 down a little amount of sodium in the 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.600
 organism what it says is so correct 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.460
 how amazing as society for the 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.650
 lack of time because of the haste has 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.120
 pushed to buy everything canned that 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.550
 comes with the bag and obviously because 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.440
 five seconds to eat and that 's where 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.810
 they have all the problems apart that 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.590
 the packaging of all types of toxins 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.870
 when overheated but if here 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.400
 if I the easy thing to go walking give the 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.350
 can fill a sachet of food 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.210
 for the day for the week and eat them from 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.220
 what one prepares them if they did 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.690
 problem instead of buying those cubes 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.700
 that are not zero naturally a 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.320
 specimen they give you the can and it's going to have 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.150
 more awareness of your body than it is 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.400
 acquiring that television 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.500
 Spanish made a special program 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.920
 regarding the salt issue and makes a 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.540
 recommendation of how obviously you have to 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.720
 consume this we can see some 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.430
 images from as such and obviously you 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.310
 they say you have to have a memory 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.140
 especially for the amounts is what 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.630
 we are seeing is a daily rite 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.620
 current one third of a 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.630
 flask 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.700
 one can calculate the amount of salt 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.190
 which buys monthly and is that only done to 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.780
 all the food finally what what 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.810
 what we see there is that when they 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.280
 began to take out the true salt or 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.950
 they took out the amount of sodium in their 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.570
 food immediately there was like a 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.910
 kind of cleaning purification 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.370
 awaken the first to mental clarity 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.140
 improves sleep and then with better
