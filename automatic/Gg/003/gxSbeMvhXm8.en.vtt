00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.779
 in the top sport it is always today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.069
 more important to the point of fit and in 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.230
 to be competitive 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 One-thousandth of a second can be over 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.620
 decide victory or defeat 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.839
 Training alone is far from enough 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 more the right nutrition 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 optimal regeneration and mental 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 Strengths are in the world top of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 crucial meaning 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.340
 more and more athletes therefore trust 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.330
 audiovisual perception promotion 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.830
 Sevenfighter Lilli Schwarzkopf has 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.450
 at the olympic games in london 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.129
 won the silver medal 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.140
 a performance that you too 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.620
 preparation with the vwf method 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.620
 ascribes 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 In such vwf method is the athletes 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.869
 music played at the sound waves 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.060
 using specially developed software 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 these sound waves are modulated 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.899
 penetrate through the rod videos muscle in 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.299
 belongs directly in the brain and nervous system 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.880
 before and give this a feeling 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.350
 absolute safety of the body can 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.780
 thereby also in times highest 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 Regenerate stress optimally in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.890
 Competitive situations can be the athletes 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
 focus on the point and you 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.630
 full potential unfolds a method 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.380
 those of many 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.380
 sports scientists 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:56.439
 because they make mistakes and these 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.530
 Ferrari is a class rising up 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.200
 get the stressful away under the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.310
 you can play that simply freed up 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.259
 or who on the fritz is one of the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.450
 Light figures of german handball 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.709
 in his incredible career as a 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.799
 Goalkeeper, he was European champion 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.519
 world champion and 2004 welthandballer 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.260
 chosen 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.269
 but he too had in his 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.530
 unprecedented career 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:29.140
 performance and on the ball and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.420
 had strong in my agility 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.390
 Restrictions because they are the method of 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.450
 avw- come to ears and have against 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.150
 uses and has due to the regular 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.540
 meetings it made an old one again 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.280
 performance limit the performance level approach 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.870
 to come and that's why it's for me 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.670
 i like this music as 2007 the german 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.500
 handball national team the miracle 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.239
 creates and world champion will have become 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.680
 the team through the audiovisual 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.569
 perception promotion to the tournament 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.760
 was prepared and also during the 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.139
 world championship accompanies the captain 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.700
 the team markus baur is 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.680
 Meanwhile, the German coach 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.049
 junior national team his 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.760
 experience with the avf method is yes 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.760
 even today to his players on 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.390
 very positive feeling so I have the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.390
 better sleep behavior 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.640
 that could lead to that, too 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 trainingspensum again boost old ones 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.880
 motion pattern caused by the injury 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.690
 have arisen and somewhere always me 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.610
 have hampered us, I become free 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.190
 could completely normal training 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.270
 he also has no problems 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.540
 over two workouts a day and 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.730
 I noticed that something happened 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.050
 is something secretly now photos 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.850
 Toothless people now benefit 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.400
 top athletes from all competitions 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.019
 areas of the ahr vwf method of 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.880
 probably most impressive evidence for the 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.130
 Success of audio visual perception 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.350
 This is certainly the method in top-level sport 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.720
 Austrian ski jumping team that since 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.090
 years from the developer of the vwf method 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.090
 ulrich conradi is personally looked after 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.759
 further information you get under
