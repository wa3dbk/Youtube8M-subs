00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.920 
there using the clutch in the handbrake
and<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:53.430> I'm<00:02:53.520> ready<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.000> start<00:02:54.510> coming<00:02:54.750> to

so just like I suspected high chairs
were<00:03:33.590> pretty<00:03:33.799> easy<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:34.340> like<00:03:34.459> 5050<00:03:35.269> since<00:03:35.930> I

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
were pretty easy just like 5050 since I

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.959
