victory at the Tour de France in 2011 we

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.490 
victory at the Tour de France in 2011 we
had<00:01:19.969> to<00:01:20.090> go<00:01:20.210> one<00:01:20.420> step<00:01:20.569> further<00:01:20.929> to<00:01:21.079> make<00:01:21.319> this

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
had to go one step further to make this

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.679 
had to go one step further to make this
bike<00:01:21.770> even<00:01:22.280> more<00:01:22.490> compliant<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.210> comfortable

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
bike even more compliant and comfortable

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.819 
bike even more compliant and comfortable
but<00:01:24.289> without<00:01:24.500> losing<00:01:25.159> any<00:01:25.610> lateral<00:01:26.149> stiffness

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
but without losing any lateral stiffness

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.870 
but without losing any lateral stiffness
we've<00:01:27.829> achieved<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.399> with<00:01:28.579> what<00:01:28.729> we<00:01:28.850> call

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
we've achieved that with what we call

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.669 
we've achieved that with what we call
angle<00:01:29.479> compliance<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:30.229> you'll<00:01:30.380> see<00:01:30.530> these

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
angle compliance so you'll see these

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.429 
angle compliance so you'll see these

the whole geometry has changed for the
