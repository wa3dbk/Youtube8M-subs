00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
happening for me so I was upset about

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.300 
happening for me so I was upset about
that<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.900> let<00:03:22.110> guys<00:03:22.769> let<00:03:22.980> me<00:03:23.010> know<00:03:23.100> your

experience<00:03:23.549> I've<00:03:23.850> given<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.209> seven<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.570> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
experience I've given with seven out of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.090 
experience I've given with seven out of
ten<00:03:24.870> obviously<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:25.410> awkward<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.799> get<00:03:25.980> him

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
ten obviously it's awkward to get him

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.949 
ten obviously it's awkward to get him
into<00:03:26.220> squads<00:03:26.730> with<00:03:27.090> his<00:03:27.209> national<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:27.900> if

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
into squads with his national and so if

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.740 
into squads with his national and so if
you<00:03:28.079> want<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.380> gold<00:03:29.370> team<00:03:30.180> especially<00:03:30.420> with

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
you want a gold team especially with

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.090 
you want a gold team especially with
there<00:03:30.870> being<00:03:31.019> no<00:03:31.200> single<00:03:31.560> player<00:03:31.709> matches

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
there being no single player matches

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.220 
there being no single player matches
meaning<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.640> always<00:03:33.030> up<00:03:33.180> against<00:03:33.450> break

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
meaning you always up against break

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.960
