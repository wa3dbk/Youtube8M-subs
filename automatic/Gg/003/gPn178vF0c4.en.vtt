feet and then rock up taking the
pressure<00:00:51.719> off<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> contact<00:00:52.500> points<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
pressure off the contact points make it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
pressure off the contact points make it
very<00:00:53.250> soft<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:53.910> easy<00:00:54.360> very<00:00:54.629> fun<00:00:54.989> board<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
ride and like i said from learning how

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
ride and like i said from learning how
makes<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> fun<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> learn<00:00:59.039> how<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> ride<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
makes it fun to learn how to ride on

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.119 
makes it fun to learn how to ride on
this<00:00:59.699> board<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> seasoned<00:01:01.920> vet

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this board so that to that seasoned vet

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.920 
this board so that to that seasoned vet
that<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.969> looking<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> softer<00:01:03.719> board

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that is just looking for a softer board

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
that is just looking for a softer board
so<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.680> great<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> girl<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.000> girl

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so it's great for the girl the girl

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
so it's great for the girl the girl
learning<00:01:06.720> takes<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> edges<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.590> snow<00:01:07.979> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
learning takes the edges of snow so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.940 
learning takes the edges of snow so
she's<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.610> catching<00:01:08.970> her<00:01:09.060> edges<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.570> much

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
she's not catching her edges as much

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.020 
she's not catching her edges as much
helps<00:01:10.950> her<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> progress<00:01:11.520> cuz<00:01:11.909> she's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
helps her kind of progress cuz she's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
helps her kind of progress cuz she's
getting<00:01:12.330> confident<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.380> fighting<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> most

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
getting confident not fighting the most

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
getting confident not fighting the most
of<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> ground<00:01:15.479> right

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
