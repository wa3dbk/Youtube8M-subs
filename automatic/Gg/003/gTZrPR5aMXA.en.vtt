00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.720
 Today video in today's video would like 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.059
 I show you how to deal with a few 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 tips and tricks even more 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.590
 can save battery and the e book reader 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.950
 Keep alive a little longer 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 can 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 we see the battery is empty here 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 fighting hard is almost empty 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.810
 and here I come to the first one 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.170
 point of pocketbook touch lux hd has 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.179
 an integrated foreground lighting 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.309
 which you can see well here too 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.230
 and very important if you have the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.719
 foreground lighting uses turns 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.340
 Regulator almost completely the requirement 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.579
 and lighting here in this case 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.100
 enough in any case to read in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.020
 the night out without problems otherwise 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.539
 of course, does not need to turn off 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.390
 Very important first point about battery too 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.500
 save up 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 then we go on we go to the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.050
 Settings are up here, of course 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 the foreground illuminator like me 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.629
 just mentioned then we have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.489
 here the network settings here the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.330
 access to the network so that with the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.490
 Wifi should of course be on 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380
 is clear that wlan if all that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 search only unnecessary after we networks here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 can recognize very well and that must 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 yes, not being here now 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.170
 look a bit further 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 okay too often fits in again and again 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.860
 the settings 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 Here we have additional 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.409
 Settings in the additional 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.969
 Settings you can complete the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.100
 pages update the set 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.959
 full pages update is if you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
 leaf through and let in an e book 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.850
 sometimes there is still so little text 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 rest in the e book reader are the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.909
 but I do not think stars 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 at least and that's why you should 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.439
 the full page update to the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.700
 highest value and it would be here 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.130
 follow up times 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.979
 why the full page update 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.959
 of course the battery and the less 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:17.269
 It is made the more battery saves 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:20.340
 of course we have you then 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.160
 low power mode up here you can see 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.190
 how much battery charge we currently have 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.489
 still have the led display the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.739
 LED indicator is the button down here and 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.769
 although if you turn on or off 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.609
 lit this absolutely useless need 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:44.970
 So we do not turn off the power of the battery 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:47.959
 then lock the device to here 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.269
 We take five minutes if the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.010
 in the screen saver comes save that 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.190
 Of course, battery so five minutes 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.680
 fastest time car should turn off 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.690
 Of course we also have the least amount of time 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.030
 take the faster the e book 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 reader turns off the more battery can 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.690
 we save 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.519
 yes that was it with mine 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.129
 little video and how you see it 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.379
 e-book-reader loads well here now 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.140
 I made it the battery is empty 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.810
 he is displayed but still I can 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.110
 now surely another 20 to 30 minutes 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.280
 read and then the battery should really 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.840
 be completely empty 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.440
 I hope you have the video 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.180

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.019
