previously a music hall in this shot I
was<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:08.619> impressed<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:09.429> the<00:01:10.109> accuracy<00:01:11.109> of

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
was just impressed with the accuracy of

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.319 
was just impressed with the accuracy of
the<00:01:11.499> colors<00:01:11.859> just<00:01:12.219> as<00:01:12.369> I<00:01:12.460> remember<00:01:12.880> them<00:01:13.030> there

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
the colors just as I remember them there

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.819 
the colors just as I remember them there
that<00:01:13.539> evening<00:01:13.719> when<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:13.990> shot<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.469> in<00:01:14.560> Riya

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
that evening when I shot it in Riya

rundown on the Pentax q10 camera first
thing<00:01:27.579> you'll<00:01:27.700> notice<00:01:27.880> about<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.359> camera<00:01:28.749> is

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
thing you'll notice about the camera is

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.889 
thing you'll notice about the camera is
got<00:01:29.170> an<00:01:29.350> f28<00:01:30.149> f45<00:01:31.469> lens<00:01:32.469> which<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:32.950> great<00:01:33.189> for

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
got an f28 f45 lens which is great for

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.379 
got an f28 f45 lens which is great for
dim<00:01:34.899> light<00:01:35.170> shooting<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:36.340> five<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:37.030> fifteen

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
dim light shooting the five to fifteen

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.889 
dim light shooting the five to fifteen
millimeter<00:01:37.990> focal<00:01:38.649> length<00:01:39.090> gives<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.329> a<00:01:40.359> nice

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
millimeter focal length gives you a nice

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.010 
millimeter focal length gives you a nice
wide<00:01:41.490> 18<00:01:42.490> millimeter<00:01:43.030> equivalent<00:01:43.389> at<00:01:43.899> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
wide 18 millimeter equivalent at the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.770 
wide 18 millimeter equivalent at the
five<00:01:44.259> setting<00:01:44.950> 15<00:01:45.700> setting<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.240> roughly<00:01:46.630> the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
five setting 15 setting is roughly the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.559 
five setting 15 setting is roughly the
equivalent<00:01:46.869> of<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.319> 50<00:01:47.649> millimeter<00:01:47.859> on<00:01:48.340> a

35-millimeter camera on the top we've

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.010 
35-millimeter camera on the top we've
got<00:01:53.499> our<00:01:53.649> flash<00:01:54.100> control<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.060> as<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:55.719> slide

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
got our flash control and as we slide

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.959 
got our flash control and as we slide
that<00:01:56.259> over<00:01:56.289> you'll<00:01:56.740> notice<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.130> flash<00:01:57.429> pops

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
that over you'll notice the flash pops

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.749 
that over you'll notice the flash pops
up<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.899> really<00:01:59.139> pops<00:01:59.380> up<00:01:59.590> nice<00:01:59.829> and<00:01:59.859> high<00:02:00.069> which

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
up it really pops up nice and high which

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.319 
up it really pops up nice and high which
prevents<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.509> red-eye<00:02:02.459> flash<00:02:03.459> will<00:02:03.729> fire<00:02:04.060> in

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
prevents the red-eye flash will fire in

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.169 
prevents the red-eye flash will fire in
either<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.779> upper<00:02:05.079> or<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.289> lower<00:02:05.590> position

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.630 
either the upper or a lower position
you've<00:02:07.179> got<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.990> setting<00:02:08.709> here<00:02:08.740> where<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.459> can

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
you've got a setting here where you can

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.949 
you've got a setting here where you can

preset for scene modes either 1 2 3 or 4

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.740 
preset for scene modes either 1 2 3 or 4
you<00:02:14.530> pick<00:02:14.769> them<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.939> then<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.330> can<00:02:16.480> quickly

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
you pick them and then you can quickly

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.880 
you pick them and then you can quickly
switch<00:02:17.170> from

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
switch from

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
switch from
into<00:02:18.069> another<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.550> if<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.730> want<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.970> do<00:02:19.120> maybe
