00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I most of these auto car sequences or

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.169 
I most of these auto car sequences or
post<00:00:04.560> lip-synched<00:00:05.600> but<00:00:07.400> that's<00:00:08.400> out<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
post lip-synched but that's out of the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.959 
post lip-synched but that's out of the
question<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:10.920> think<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> next<00:00:11.370> thing<00:00:11.820> you

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
question so I think the next thing you

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.530 
question so I think the next thing you
should<00:00:12.179> consider<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.049> vehicle<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
should consider is the vehicle and

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.670 
should consider is the vehicle and
probably<00:00:15.540> you're<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> want<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.350> borrow

you'll have difficulty placing cameras I
pretty<00:00:45.030> sure<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> Range<00:00:45.690> Rovers<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.320> quieter

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
pretty sure a Range Rovers a lot quieter

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.120 
pretty sure a Range Rovers a lot quieter
than<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.920 

looks<00:00:51.670> like<00:00:51.880> there's<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.180> wedding<00:00:52.330> happening

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
looks like there's a wedding happening

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:00.900 
looks like there's a wedding happening
up<00:00:53.050> here<00:00:53.080> at<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.410> castle<00:00:53.620> today

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.430 

this<00:01:01.600> is<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:03.000> typical<00:01:04.000> be<00:01:04.540> road<00:01:07.229> maybe<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.350> little

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
this is a typical be road maybe a little

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.480 
this is a typical be road maybe a little
smoother

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.499 

but<00:01:16.119> anyway<00:01:17.970> um

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
but anyway um

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.730 
but anyway um
next<00:01:21.509> test<00:01:21.750> will<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.259> DSLR<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:24.740> DSLR

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
next test will be with a DSLR a DSLR

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.510 
next test will be with a DSLR a DSLR
because<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.520> too<00:01:26.579> have<00:01:27.149> a<00:01:27.799> small<00:01:28.799> profile

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
because they too have a small profile

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
because they too have a small profile
allowing<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> mount<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:30.720> away<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.360> not<00:01:33.360> be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
allowing you to mount it away and not be

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.990 
allowing you to mount it away and not be
stuck<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.649> wide<00:01:34.860> angle<00:01:35.039> lens<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.789> the

stuck with a wide angle lens because the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
stuck with a wide angle lens because the

going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.899> be<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.409> did<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> quick

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
going to be good I did do a quick

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
going to be good I did do a quick
handheld<00:01:42.030> test<00:01:42.330> with<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> GoPro<00:01:42.929> mounted<00:01:43.409> in

the center of the windshield on normal
wide<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.429> super<00:01:47.820> wide<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.530> actually

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
wide not not super wide and it actually

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.690 
wide not not super wide and it actually
looked<00:01:50.100> pretty<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> takes<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.700> both

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
looked pretty good and it takes in both

looked pretty good and it takes in both
people<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.330> front<00:01:54.569> seat<00:01:54.860> quite<00:01:55.860> nicely

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
people in the front seat quite nicely

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.309 
people in the front seat quite nicely
it's<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.229> small<00:01:58.590> low<00:01:58.860> profile<00:01:59.340> camera

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
it's a very small low profile camera

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.389 
it's a very small low profile camera
that<00:02:01.319> one<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.830> be<00:02:02.009> set<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:03.209> 20<00:02:04.399> yeah

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
that one can be set to I think 20 yeah

that one can be set to I think 20 yeah
you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.729> set<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> 24<00:02:06.990> FPS<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.709> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
you can set that one to 24 FPS if you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.270 
you can set that one to 24 FPS if you
want<00:02:08.099> also<00:02:09.000> 25<00:02:09.780> also<00:02:10.410> 50<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.190> is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
want also 25 also 50 this one is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.539 
want also 25 also 50 this one is
currently<00:02:11.640> set<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.090> 50<00:02:12.860> this<00:02:13.860> could<00:02:14.130> be<00:02:14.160> set<00:02:14.519> to

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
currently set on 50 this could be set to

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:21.500 
currently set on 50 this could be set to
25<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.330> not<00:02:15.480> 24<00:02:19.819> well<00:02:20.819> they<00:02:21.030> might<00:02:21.209> as<00:02:21.330> well

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
25 but not 24 well they might as well

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.830 
25 but not 24 well they might as well
drive<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.319> rest<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.680> way<00:02:22.799> around

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.110 

I'm<00:02:32.410> pretty<00:02:32.739> sure<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.010> can<00:02:33.310> get<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.640> camera

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
I'm pretty sure I can get this camera

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.850 
I'm pretty sure I can get this camera
mounted<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> little<00:02:34.840> steadier<00:02:35.110> than<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.620> it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
mounted a little steadier than that it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830 
mounted a little steadier than that it
literally<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:37.030> sitting<00:02:37.450> there<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.250 
girl a tripod which the two points sort
of<00:02:40.750> wired<00:02:41.019> down<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.860> doesn't<00:02:42.190> fly<00:02:43.030> off<00:02:43.260> not

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
of wired down so it doesn't fly off not

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
of wired down so it doesn't fly off not
much<00:02:44.470> really<00:02:44.800> holding<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.340> there<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.040> who

much really holding it there and who

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.820 
much really holding it there and who
knows<00:02:51.459> there's<00:02:51.730> probably<00:02:52.060> some<00:02:52.269> sort<00:02:52.569> of
