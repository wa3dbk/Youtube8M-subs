list<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:34.020> threw<00:00:34.620> together<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:35.100> conversion

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
list I threw together this conversion

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.120 
list I threw together this conversion
before<00:00:36.240> a<00:00:36.450> model<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.900> released<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.560> and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
before a model was released for it and

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.010 
before a model was released for it and
full<00:00:38.880> disclosure<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.540> originally<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

based it off of the gray night
dreadknight<00:00:47.520> model<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:48.750> model<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dreadknight model and the model here is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.920 
dreadknight model and the model here is
actually<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.700> conversion<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.240> inspired<00:00:51.630> by

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
actually the conversion is inspired by

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130 
actually the conversion is inspired by

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
great stuff the the model has quite a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
great stuff the the model has quite a
few<00:01:01.800> bits<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.220> it<00:01:02.370> obviously<00:01:02.730> based<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
few bits in it obviously based on the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.289 
few bits in it obviously based on the
dreadknight<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.610> Valkyrie

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
dreadknight but then got the Valkyrie

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
dreadknight but then got the Valkyrie
rocket<00:01:06.659> pods<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> main<00:01:07.470> armament<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
rocket pods for the main armament on the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.390 
rocket pods for the main armament on the
on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.630> arms<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.560> arms<00:01:10.590> themselves<00:01:11.280> are

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
on the arms the arms themselves are

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.429 
on the arms the arms themselves are
actually<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.880> support<00:01:12.299> Pistons<00:01:12.689> from<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
actually the support Pistons from the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually the support Pistons from the
dreadknight<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.329> obviously<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
dreadknight that you know obviously I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.530 
dreadknight that you know obviously I
didn't<00:01:15.930> put<00:01:16.079> its<00:01:16.259> arms<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
didn't put its arms on and then the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.830 
didn't put its arms on and then the
whole<00:01:18.840> front<00:01:19.320> area<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:20.510> mostly<00:01:21.510> done<00:01:21.780> with

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
whole front area is mostly done with

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.360 
whole front area is mostly done with
plastic<00:01:22.740> art<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.180> head<00:01:24.540> itself<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:25.370> land

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
plastic art the head itself is a land

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.110 
plastic art the head itself is a land
raider<00:01:26.610> sensor<00:01:27.480> I<00:01:27.510> think<00:01:27.810> off<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> sponson

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
raider sensor I think off the sponson

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.330 
raider sensor I think off the sponson
and<00:01:30.120> then<00:01:30.300> one<00:01:30.510> part<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.560> you'll

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and then one part I really like you'll

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.040 
and then one part I really like you'll
get<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.550> see<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.850> again<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> second<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
get to see here again in a second is the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.920 
get to see here again in a second is the
little<00:01:34.890> manipulator<00:01:35.400> arms<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> front<00:01:36.870> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
little manipulator arms on the front of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.040 
little manipulator arms on the front of
the<00:01:37.020> carapace<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.890> did<00:01:38.550> those<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.390> couple

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
from the 30k mechanicus that lakhs kid

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.070 
from the 30k mechanicus that lakhs kid
cool<00:01:47.490> lots<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:48.090> bits<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.900> come

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
cool lots of little bits that all come

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.690 
cool lots of little bits that all come
together<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.650> really<00:01:49.979> cool<00:01:50.159> conversion

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
together for a really cool conversion

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.039 
together for a really cool conversion
can<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> talk<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
can you talk about some of the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.510 
can you talk about some of the
techniques<00:01:52.380> he<00:01:52.620> used<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> stuff

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
techniques he used and some of the stuff

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.890 
techniques he used and some of the stuff
she<00:01:53.549> did<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.150> actually<00:01:54.450> painted<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
she did when you actually painted a

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.820 
she did when you actually painted a
model<00:01:55.700> yeah<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.869> painted<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> model<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
model yeah I painted the model I

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.130 
model yeah I painted the model I
converted<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> fully<00:02:00.150> first<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.990> then

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
converted it fully first and then

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.550 
converted it fully first and then
painted<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.010> used<00:02:02.940> for<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.810> main<00:02:04.080> body

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
painted it I used for the main body

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.820 
painted it I used for the main body
I<00:02:04.740> used<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.430> trusty<00:02:06.270> tinny<00:02:06.960> tin<00:02:07.260> followed<00:02:07.710> up

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
I used the trusty tinny tin followed up

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.190 
I used the trusty tinny tin followed up
by<00:02:07.860> brassy<00:02:08.459> brass<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:09.629> mechanicus

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
by brassy brass good mechanicus

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.339 
by brassy brass good mechanicus
technique<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.739> picked<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.099> from<00:02:11.340> Dave<00:02:11.909> Taylor

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
technique I picked up from Dave Taylor

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.930 
technique I picked up from Dave Taylor
and<00:02:13.349> then<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> Reds<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> models<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and then the Reds on the models are the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.100
