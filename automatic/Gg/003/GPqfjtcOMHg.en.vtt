00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.330
 nice guys those sectors and welcome back 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.119
 I'll show commentaries today I 'm here 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.300
 to offer you a game of mine 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.040
 on the chosen shooter mode and for whom 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.529
 did not know that marksman chose that 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.050
 how to change every 40 seconds 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.689
 but let's say it's nothing for that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.250
 in short, he wanted to show it to you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.010
 then after making a brief summary 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.809
 of this game it immediately passes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.210
 the main argument to the argument that 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.879
 if he doesn't know me so tormented in these 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.440
 three days if you can say how 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.050
 some of you will have already understood I am 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.329
 referring he broke commander e 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.570
 today the boys are here to tell you 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.730
 definitely that I decided to stop 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.219
 I know this series to some of you 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.870
 I will also be sorry that I said that 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.149
 the majority, in short, would have won 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.670
 but unfortunately I rely on the facts myself 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.020
 I have to rely on what I see the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.869
 first episode went all in all 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.759
 quite well but then the second the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.520
 third really was a decline was 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.080
 a good sadness for me 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 few were the people you know that 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.740
 they followed this rubric then 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.050
 understand well that if I have to lose the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.849
 time to make videos 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.709
 I want this time to be 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.179
 well spent in some part there is also 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.429
 repaid 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.560
 some of you were right indeed 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.319
 right when they say that tonight 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.240
 it is made by too many youtuber unfortunately 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.009
 I didn't pay any attention to them and then 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.160
 I apologize to you all, indeed, if you do 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.899
 just to apologize and maybe it was also 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.459
 in short, these were not followed 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.369
 however, as an address book I don't want to stay here at 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.239
 find excuses evidence of this type 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.890
 as and quoted on my page 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.690
 Facebook is more than four thousand 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.239
 people and it's really impossible 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.099
 accommodate so all hope 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.509
 however you can appreciate that 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.110
 may you understand this mine 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.940
 decision and I want to clarify that i 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.679
 three episodes just from broken with mender 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.599
 that I uploaded to my channel will come 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.030
 deleted so they will be removed not 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.930
 they will be more visible on my own 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.150
 channel because it makes no sense to leave 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.030
 but one will be open like this if it is not 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.980
 ended here maybe I'll bring you some 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.200
 play on zombies live together with mine 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.549
 friends and let's say that in my opinion it could 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 be a solution also because 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.109
 something fun might come out 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.510
 then since you are you cannot see 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.280
 the videos that you just have to entertain 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.900
 let me know what you think here 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.459
 below in the comments 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.519
 naturally I will also bring you some beautiful 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.980
 unfortunately results on this game 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.349
 as you know how you got to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.569
 understand there is no charge in the mobile 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.269
 nuclear so let's say you have to do 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.669
 a bit like how it succeeds and I must say 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.189
 that in short this is my opinion then 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.090
 I don't know if that's the case for you too 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.189
 compared to the other call of duty black 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.919
 ops 2 is a little more complicated to succeed 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.810
 in short, make some good matches 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.840
 in short, quite nice of the party 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.879
 of the over 50 to understand us however in 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.859
 just with a bit of luck with with a little 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.560
 of will and with just rewards 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.180
 you can get something out of it e 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.219
 remaining on the subject of rewards I can 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.519
 tell you that today I unlocked the dogs and that 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:19.229
 I took them like three times in type 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.940
 five games if I 'm not wrong I have to say 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.459
 that boys devastate if not 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.870
 a crazy stuff in fact they are one of the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.470
 rewards that requires the most 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.930
 number of points if I'm not mistaken because how 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.359
 you can know about black ops two you go for 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.919
 then streak and not for killstreak then 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.229
 nothing when you unlocked them there 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.209
 advice and nothing short 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.239
 having said that I wanted to change 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.189
 theme is to tell you about a little problem maybe 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.680
 that is always detected in my videos or 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.120
 better you pointed out to me 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.590
 about the kids microphone like 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.569
 I know I had some time ago 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.519
 changed the microphone a bit and I have to say 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.250
 that yes this 4 now annabella quality 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.019
 only that it remains laude a little low 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.540
 I don't know how to do it because I have increased 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.400
 at most be on the computer maybe 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.310
 I will try to put the maximum volume which 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
 su sony vegas and then when you hear 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.790
 this video will be all up to and 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 let me walk if it has changed 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.840
 something or if nothing has changed 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.090
 I mean if he can't change 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.609
 I wouldn't know what to do then maybe if 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.989
 you have advice just let me know 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.370
 because you are my only source of 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.529
 salvation and no small boys 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.580
 I can tell you what maybe it will be 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.870
 in the future between some 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.050
 I'm in a few weeks now 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.479
 precisely I do not know can in fact be that 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.490
 there are two commentaries I don't know about now 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.139
 my channel on his however with a 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.719
 great youtube with a great one 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.639
 person we say I know from amber po 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.289
 of time however I don't want to anticipate you now 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.210
 nothing because there is nothing yet 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.340
 certainly there is nothing yet 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.800
 planned we must organize ourselves again 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.189
 well, in short, there is a program 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.930
 that's about commentary and I hope it's a 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.189
 nice thing also for voices could 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.169
 listen and see 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.849
 however nothing the gameplay is by now 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.889
 come to an end I hope there is 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.780
 liked I recommend you remember that 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.719

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:24.689
 said before my choices to withdraw 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.219
 broken with man guys believe me it's not 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.529
 was a deliberate majesty choice one 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.539
 forced choice so this should 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:34.819
 say everything and nothing from us we feel 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.819
 the next is nothing good
