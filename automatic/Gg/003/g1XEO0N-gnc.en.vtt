 otterndorf and one in santa michael 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.860
 Both are from schools 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.500
 Professionally the kids learn 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.630
 in a playful way skiing and at 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.070
 The children's ski races are already dominating 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.420
 Start the competition idea like this 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.420
 maybe future world champion 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.500
 the length of the departures and the soon the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.510
 Pisten also prevents them 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.660
 There are overflowing skies 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.850
 twice as much fun and if you do 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.800
 no desire to ski or has been 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.380
 even then there is a wide 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.680
 offer so with us are mainly 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.390
 Skier and the leisure sport thing 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.200
 What's the possibility with snowshoeing and 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.970
 cross-country skiing 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.040
 they are of course everything with us 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.260
 present and because we have great 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.050
 offer but are not really important 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.910
 the skiers have long since arrived at our place 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.950
 winter sports therefore core wise in suez 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.550
 Mansura prospect has as now where one 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.040
 represent 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.990
 but official karavanks and too 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.990
 this day it's just a highlight 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.590
 with its height up to 2400 meters is 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.830
 it is not the highest one 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.360
 glacier ski area in salzburg throughout 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.580
 Salzburg has no other 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.560
 possibility of too high up in style too 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.780
 drive and because of the favorable situation 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.780
 Snow reliability is always 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.580
 given 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.590
 The area is being heard from all sides 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.750
 supplied with snow and should once all 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.940
 do not tear and the weather does not 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.160
 play along then there is still enough 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.930
 snow facilities around the snow for the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.700
 winter sports to how we afford to 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.930
 Come in and relax 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060
 different ones would have one 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.560
 great offer of delicacies 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.560
 and a good service 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.459
 we have a lot of cabins on the mountain and 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.130
 have to say these cabins are very good 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.780
 guided and everyone has their ideas and 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.030
 of course brings a variety allowed the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.220
 huts live the south and I believe 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.820
 that always continues very well 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.100
 placed 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.840
 from the quality and of course 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.910
 from the whole summer with everything 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.860
 and turn 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.600
 and due to the favorable situation and 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.760
 a hundred percent snowmaking 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.850
 is there again optimal this year 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.810
 piste relationships 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.620
 So we are really in the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.320
 happy situation 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.530
 it's a real take away so far 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.910
 to fight south and also in the west 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.100
 and we have mistress in the rental 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.410
 really very much snow and have 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.810
 also good temperatures of the mine at 1300 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.140
 meters long and have done great 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.190
 that you actually best 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.650
 We have winter conditions in the middle 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.830
 in winter when the normal season is 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.139
 when the last sunbeams are big and 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.680
 the nightlife begins cumbersome 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.139
 good mood in the many huts 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.430
 is trump and the hÃ¼ttengaudi comes 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.650
 also not too short 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.539
 while outside the ski area on the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.539
 next day is prepared
