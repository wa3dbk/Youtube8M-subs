00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
Caroline's parlor

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.060 
Caroline's parlor
so<00:00:07.700> my<00:00:08.900> parlor<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:09.990> actually<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.740> three

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so my parlor is actually in three

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.100 
so my parlor is actually in three
separate<00:00:11.429> locations<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.179> don't<00:00:12.509> have<00:00:12.780> room

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
separate locations so I don't have room

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.160 
separate locations so I don't have room
in<00:00:13.469> my<00:00:13.830> bedroom<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.910> set<00:00:15.599> up<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.900> all

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
in my bedroom to have it set up with all

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.740 
in my bedroom to have it set up with all
three<00:00:16.710> pieces<00:00:17.369> together<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
three pieces together which is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.710 
three pieces together which is
unfortunate<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.250> think<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.910> still<00:00:21.240> found<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
unfortunate but I think I still found a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.920 
unfortunate but I think I still found a
way<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.930> kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> make<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.269> work<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.539> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
way to kind of make it work and it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.390 
way to kind of make it work and it
actually<00:00:25.109> looks<00:00:25.470> like<00:00:25.619> three<00:00:25.830> separate<00:00:26.189> rooms

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
actually looks like three separate rooms

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.599

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.610 
the bottom and it just has the little
light<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:16.699> it<00:05:17.150> gives<00:05:17.419> it<00:05:17.630> sort<00:05:17.870> of<00:05:17.990> like<00:05:18.199> a<00:05:18.229> faux

kind<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.870> in<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:23.990> background<00:05:24.440> so<00:05:24.740> that's<00:05:24.919> cool

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
kind of in the background so that's cool

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.610 
kind of in the background so that's cool
I<00:05:25.630> mean<00:05:26.630> it's<00:05:26.690> kind<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.139> weird<00:05:27.260> cuz<00:05:27.470> if<00:05:27.560> you

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
I mean it's kind of weird cuz if you

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.870 
I mean it's kind of weird cuz if you
look<00:05:27.740> at<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.919> from<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.099> top<00:05:28.159> it's<00:05:28.460> obviously

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
look at it from the top it's obviously

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.589 
look at it from the top it's obviously
lights<00:05:30.430> but<00:05:31.430> if<00:05:31.789> you<00:05:31.940> look<00:05:32.090> at<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.300> from<00:05:32.389> this

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
lights but if you look at it from this

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.379 
lights but if you look at it from this
this<00:05:33.199> angle<00:05:33.560> it's<00:05:33.979> a<00:05:34.190> nice<00:05:34.340> little<00:05:34.490> glow<00:05:34.789> so

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
this angle it's a nice little glow so

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.730 
this angle it's a nice little glow so
it's<00:05:35.570> pretty<00:05:35.780> cool<00:05:36.020> it<00:05:36.199> just<00:05:36.289> depends<00:05:36.680> the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
it's pretty cool it just depends the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.770 
it's pretty cool it just depends the
angle<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.190> look<00:05:37.310> at<00:05:37.460> it<00:05:37.580> from<00:05:37.820> but<00:05:38.150> it's<00:05:38.720> a

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
angle you look at it from but it's a

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.420 
angle you look at it from but it's a
nice<00:05:38.990> effect<00:05:39.199> I<00:05:39.500> wish<00:05:39.800> they<00:05:39.979> would<00:05:40.130> have<00:05:40.220> done

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
nice effect I wish they would have done

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.760 
nice effect I wish they would have done
a<00:05:40.460> crackling<00:05:41.060> fire<00:05:41.150> similar<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.139> maybe<00:05:42.260> kaya's

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.720 
color it matches sort of my room and I
just<00:06:12.320> loved<00:06:12.710> it<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.010> I<00:06:13.070> thought<00:06:13.220> I<00:06:13.280> could<00:06:13.520> use

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
just loved it and I thought I could use

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.340 
just loved it and I thought I could use
it<00:06:13.880> even<00:06:14.000> with<00:06:14.210> my<00:06:14.240> modern<00:06:14.660> girls<00:06:14.900> if<00:06:15.020> I<00:06:15.110> really

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
it even with my modern girls if I really

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.290 
it even with my modern girls if I really
wanted<00:06:15.650> to<00:06:15.890> it<00:06:16.310> gets<00:06:16.460> ridiculously<00:06:17.030> expensive

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
wanted to it gets ridiculously expensive

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.410 
wanted to it gets ridiculously expensive
I<00:06:17.840> got<00:06:18.080> it<00:06:18.170> as<00:06:18.290> a<00:06:18.320> gift<00:06:18.650> from<00:06:19.520> my<00:06:19.700> sister<00:06:19.730> if<00:06:20.270> I

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
I got it as a gift from my sister if I

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.030 
I got it as a gift from my sister if I
hadn't<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:20.900> probably<00:06:21.230> would<00:06:21.590> have<00:06:21.620> waited<00:06:21.980> a

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
hadn't I probably would have waited a

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.350 
hadn't I probably would have waited a
long<00:06:22.220> time<00:06:22.280> to<00:06:22.460> purchase<00:06:22.730> it<00:06:23.000> on<00:06:23.090> my<00:06:23.180> own<00:06:23.210> I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
long time to purchase it on my own I

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.940 
long time to purchase it on my own I
would<00:06:23.570> have<00:06:23.690> to<00:06:23.810> save<00:06:23.990> up<00:06:24.140> for<00:06:24.170> it<00:06:24.500> and<00:06:24.590> get<00:06:24.770> it

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
would have to save up for it and get it

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.340 
would have to save up for it and get it
because<00:06:25.310> it's<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.580> lot<00:06:25.730> of<00:06:25.760> money<00:06:25.970> and<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:27.110> think

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
because it's a lot of money and I think

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.840 
because it's a lot of money and I think
it's<00:06:27.470> unfortunate<00:06:28.040> for<00:06:28.070> kids<00:06:28.430> because<00:06:28.730> you

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
it's unfortunate for kids because you

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.550 
it's unfortunate for kids because you
can't<00:06:29.120> you<00:06:29.390> know<00:06:29.480> it's<00:06:29.750> expensive<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:30.410> maybe

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
can't you know it's expensive so maybe

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.440 
can't you know it's expensive so maybe
it'll<00:06:30.800> go<00:06:30.890> on<00:06:30.920> sale<00:06:31.280> one<00:06:31.490> day<00:06:31.670> or<00:06:31.970> you<00:06:32.060> can<00:06:32.240> save

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
it'll go on sale one day or you can save

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.150 
it'll go on sale one day or you can save
up<00:06:32.630> for<00:06:32.660> it<00:06:32.990> but<00:06:33.200> it<00:06:33.290> is<00:06:33.440> a<00:06:33.470> great<00:06:33.740> piece<00:06:33.950> I<00:06:34.100> do
