direct<00:01:48.690> from<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> farmer<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.010> hasn't

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
direct from the farmer so it hasn't

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.040 
direct from the farmer so it hasn't
really<00:01:50.490> been<00:01:50.640> processed<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.660> just<00:01:51.869> been

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
really been processed it's just been

much sort of natural condition just
dried<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:58.890> separated<00:01:59.400> from<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> husk<00:02:00.020> so

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
dried and separated from the husk so

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.520 
dried and separated from the husk so
this<00:02:01.350> machine<00:02:01.590> polishes<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:03.170> so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.229> can

this machine polishes it so you can

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.290 
this machine polishes it so you can
choose<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:06.470> polished<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.650> want<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:08.300> how

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
cook it so feed it in one side and then

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.420 
cook it so feed it in one side and then
take<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> bag<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:22.950> emptied<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
from and put it on the other side and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.710 
from and put it on the other side and
sort<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.340> skin<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> falling<00:02:27.510> there

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
sort of skin you see it falling there

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.229 
sort of skin you see it falling there
it's<00:02:28.590> been<00:02:28.769> hard<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.130> white<00:02:29.580> rice<00:02:29.820> falling

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
it's been hard to see white rice falling

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.900 
it's been hard to see white rice falling
against<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> white<00:02:30.840> background<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.910> it's

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
against a white background but it's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.550 
against a white background but it's
coming<00:02:33.209> out<00:02:33.480> polished

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.410 

so<00:02:39.160> here's<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.520> difference<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.240> see
