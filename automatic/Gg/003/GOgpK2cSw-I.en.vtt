expected to bring some staff snack but
for<00:00:11.280> some<00:00:11.429> reason<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.910> don't<00:00:12.360> know<00:00:12.660> what<00:00:12.870> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
for some reason I don't know what I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.299 
for some reason I don't know what I
don't<00:00:13.139> know<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.259> or<00:00:13.349> something<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.040> my

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
don't know if or something to do with my

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.369 
don't know if or something to do with my
USB<00:00:14.969> ports<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> back<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.049> it's

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
USB ports at the back but it's it's

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.740 
USB ports at the back but it's it's
freezing<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.100> my<00:00:17.250> mouse<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.789> my<00:00:17.910> PVR<00:00:18.449> up

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
freezing like my mouse in my PVR up

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.570 
freezing like my mouse in my PVR up
which<00:00:19.289> means<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> PV<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.369> stopped

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
which means that the PV I just stopped

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.359 
which means that the PV I just stopped
recording<00:00:20.880> when<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.300> slightly<00:00:21.570> legs<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.369> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
recording when it's slightly legs and so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.370 
recording when it's slightly legs and so
I'm<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> try<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> little<00:00:24.720> bit<00:00:24.900> later<00:00:25.050> see

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'm going to try a little bit later see

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
I'm going to try a little bit later see
what<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.369> probably<00:00:26.550> need<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what I can do I think I probably need to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
what I can do I think I probably need to
get<00:00:27.060> something<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.170> know<00:00:28.289> plugs<00:00:28.619> into

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
get something that you know plugs into

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.099 
get something that you know plugs into
one<00:00:29.099> USB<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> then<00:00:29.849> has<00:00:30.090> four<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.480> five<00:00:30.660> ports

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
one USB and then has four or five ports

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
one USB and then has four or five ports
leading<00:00:31.529> off<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.099> hopefully<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
leading off from it but hopefully we can

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.470 
leading off from it but hopefully we can
last<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.690> pack<00:00:33.899> company<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:35.520> tried<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
last for this pack company and I tried a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.270 
last for this pack company and I tried a
couple<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.840> times<00:00:36.960> I've<00:00:37.290> lost<00:00:37.770> pretty<00:00:38.160> much

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
couple of times I've lost pretty much

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.549 
couple of times I've lost pretty much
almost<00:00:38.850> two<00:00:39.149> full<00:00:39.360> episodestart<00:00:39.780> attacks<00:00:40.379> i'm

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
almost two full episodestart attacks i'm

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
almost two full episodestart attacks i'm
going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:40.980> i<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:42.090> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
going to see what i can do with that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.510 
going to see what i can do with that
I've<00:00:42.899> also<00:00:43.110> lost<00:00:43.410> footage<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.040> another<00:00:44.280> team

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I've also lost footage with another team

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.119 
I've also lost footage with another team
so<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.320> don't<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.440> want<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.860> trade

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so I don't really want to go and trade

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
so I don't really want to go and trade
but<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.210> we'll<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.200> happens

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
but we will see we'll see what happens

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
but we will see we'll see what happens
um<00:00:49.940> I'm<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> try<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.300> keep<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.660> short

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
um I'm going to try and keep it as short

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.750 
um I'm going to try and keep it as short
as<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.050> possibly<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.949> know<00:00:53.129> under<00:00:53.579> three

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
as I possibly can you know under three

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
as I possibly can you know under three
and<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> half<00:00:53.940> minutes<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.629> give<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and a half minutes to give it as a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
and a half minutes to give it as a
little<00:00:55.500> chance<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.890> possible<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.550> freezing<00:00:57.180> on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
little chance as possible as freezing on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
little chance as possible as freezing on
me<00:00:57.770> but<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.949> never<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.570> it<00:01:00.570> might<00:01:00.780> work<00:01:01.170> now

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
