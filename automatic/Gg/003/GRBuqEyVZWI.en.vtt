00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
much because you know we're not going to

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.069

alternate version of the game especially

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
alternate version of the game especially
because<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.569> pretty<00:01:15.840> rough<00:01:16.229> so
