00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.150
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.270
 look at the here at the new music 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 academy great that you are there for 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.230
 reward for your time with him 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 I've been wasting watching you 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.670
 a nice little phrase about g7 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.660
 brought 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.360
 take a look at the base is in the reason 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.360
 here only manager 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.660
 in the first step it becomes a g7 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.660
 Apache 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.720
 46 of the b side is installed 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 and above all, becomes a Croatian 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 ornament stone here at the b im 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.330
 fourth band of the g string so at the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.710
 Big doctors SG installed from below 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.160
 take that, that offers the be 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160
 decorate 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 There is very little like one 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.240
 little dirty bluesy 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.510
 so watch the soundtrack to it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.070
 starts with the apache plus 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.070
 Chromatic ornament stone 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.869
 now down in g 7 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.399
 now the beer is from both sides 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.770
 a grave with the nato ready is the 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.450
 cheerful chromatic neighbor gates and 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.440
 finally dream 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.970
 the terz and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.690
 the basic tone goes 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.690
 very slowly 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.090
 harmonic environment of this line is whole 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.490
 clearly g7 either in the blues context 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.170
 or if he ever plays a solo title 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.700
 after how to articulate the whole 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.560
 You can even do that a bit country 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.140
 sound moderately 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.140
 okay we bring that up to speed 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 1234 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340
 because 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.370
 it sounds a bit smoother when we do 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.250
 not to strike but with a 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.140
 horn exclude from the bee as flat beat 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:18.900
 So the b flat on third and first 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:20.940
 finger to the sound b that sounds like that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.100
 henry replaces the stop 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 but your hand must be here, of course 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.560
 change strike stay game times 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.560
 slowly 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:41.060
 also at the end of the line as a substitute for 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.319
 a regular stop 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.959
 Now let's bring the line something 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.959
 on tempo 123 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.690
 a little faster 124
