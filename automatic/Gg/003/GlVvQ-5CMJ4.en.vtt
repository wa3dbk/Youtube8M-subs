00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.340
 here is the smartphone but he plays mx3 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.870
 it's a Chinese smartphone that we 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 expected a lot in France since 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.970
 it's a manufacturer that focuses on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.100
 the design and the quality of the product 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.680
 so to offer top devices of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.699
 range on the market while trying to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.699
 reduce prices as much as possible 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.910
 this smartphone has for first quality 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
 to be very pleasant to use 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.629
 thanks to its flame system 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.760
 goes off android retouched by mesul who 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.350
 is very fluid and has some good 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.969
 ideas in terms of ergonomics 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 we think the system is not yet 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.809
 arrived quite mature that said 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.020
 he already has a very good idea 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.160
 the processor will be enough to use 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.199
 near all available apps 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.219
 on android 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.410
 despite some small jerks in 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
 video games quite insignificant 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.920
 it is largely powerful enough to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.629
 satisfy even a users 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 demanding that said the least powerful 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 that high-end smartphones 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 current second quality the device 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.310
 take very good pictures thanks to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 its sony sensor the image is sharp 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.710
 the white balance is always 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.909
 successful the problem is that in video if 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.330
 the picture is still good 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.460
 we have some problems of fluidity of the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.140
 a little bug in my opinion it will take 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.729
 solve by an update finally 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.320
 let's talk about design obviously that is a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 the main qualities of the smartphone 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.009
 in terms of its forms and its 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.720
 proportions it is very nice to 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.700
 use the particular screen that occupies 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.040
 a very large part of the facade of the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.329
 smartphone that is very nice in 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.329
 applications and on the internet 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.200
 the problem is that this smartphone 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.689
 accumulates too many weaknesses according to us 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 which actually made us against 1 rather 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 badly note it started with the hull 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.890
 back of the smartphone that is in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.520
 bright plastic that is quite sensitive to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.350
 fingerprints 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.780
 then we can draw up a list 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.299
 quick of all these handicaps he did not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.670
 microsd memory card reader there 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.910
 does not have a removable battery is not 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.619
 4g and its screen is dim and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.480
 especially a fairly high contrast ratio 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.430
 weak in relation to competition and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.290
 finally the biggest handicap of this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.510
 smartphone is its autonomy then 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.930
 if it is actually 16 hours in 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.670
 gsm voice communication screen off as soon 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.640
 to turn on the screen is something else 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.069
 it takes about 6h30 7h in 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.260
 web browsing video playback and that 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.660
 for a high-end smartphone at + 450 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.910
 euros is too low since 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.129
 today the best exceeds 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.840
 briskly the 10 hours with the screen 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:45.180
 lit up then our verdict is so a 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.739
 little cruel for this smartphone knowing 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.260
 that he is actually very pretty very 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.359
 nice to use overall that said 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.209
 all its weaknesses that accumulate 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.190
 and in particular its autonomy pushes us to 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.599
 do not recommend it to purchase for 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.209
 the moment and knowing that we still have 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.230
 noticed very very good idea 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 at miles or for smartphones 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.709
 android we think the brand a very 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.709
 high potential in the future
