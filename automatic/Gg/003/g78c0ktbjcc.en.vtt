00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
in berserk um these I'm just tested in

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.310 
in berserk um these I'm just tested in
here<00:05:57.039> it's<00:05:57.159> a<00:05:57.220> fun<00:05:57.370> deck<00:05:57.550> so<00:05:57.849> I<00:05:58.630> haven't<00:05:59.139> played

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
here it's a fun deck so I haven't played

much with them but they just came out in
primal<00:06:01.659> origins<00:06:01.930> so<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:03.699> can<00:06:03.820> read<00:06:03.940> their

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
primal origins so you can read their

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.270 
primal origins so you can read their
effect<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.509> basically<00:06:04.720> you<00:06:04.900> gains<00:06:05.280> they're

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280

should be writing another ultra but I've
got<00:07:01.060> another<00:07:01.360> decks<00:07:01.660> um<00:07:01.900> so<00:07:02.620> 320<00:07:02.980> Piett<00:07:03.220> I<00:07:03.430> ran

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
got another decks um so 320 Piett I ran

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.730 
got another decks um so 320 Piett I ran
to<00:07:04.030> but<00:07:04.330> you<00:07:04.510> know<00:07:04.540> what<00:07:04.780> sometimes<00:07:05.500> you<00:07:05.620> go

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
to but you know what sometimes you go

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.410 
to but you know what sometimes you go
through<00:07:05.980> two<00:07:06.160> and<00:07:06.370> you<00:07:06.700> can<00:07:06.820> still<00:07:06.940> make<00:07:07.210> place

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
through two and you can still make place

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.140 
through two and you can still make place
so<00:07:07.750> run<00:07:08.410> 3<00:07:08.710> is<00:07:08.800> utopia<00:07:09.070> dick<00:07:11.610> one<00:07:12.610> of<00:07:13.000> the
