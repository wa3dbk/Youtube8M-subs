00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:51.760

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:32.020
 mouth and gravy and I recorded an honor 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:53.160

00:05:32.020 --> 00:06:12.940

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.440
 As you saw at the beginning of the video. 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.380
 say that there will be video on Tuesday and 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.599

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.370
 post this sixth straight video 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.169
 similar facing 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.380
 but what happens I'm on the move 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.570
 I said I'm moving house or 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.130
 for a larger house and maybe it was good 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.630
 for me it will be good with the recordings 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.360
 etc 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.169

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.960
 you 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.720

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.180
 if you enjoy this way of editing this 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.669
 will be the kind of editing that will take 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.360
 Tuesday through Friday will have the kind of decision 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:02.139

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.240
