00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
to cover the egg around I hope you can

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790 
to cover the egg around I hope you can
see<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:49.060> black<00:02:49.390> tape<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.810> black<00:02:50.020> tape<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.500> in

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
see it's black tape to black tape but in

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.770 
see it's black tape to black tape but in
a<00:02:50.920> close-up<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.520> can<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.300> wrapping

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
a close-up you can see here I'm wrapping

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.600 
a close-up you can see here I'm wrapping
it<00:02:52.870> around<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.680> reason<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:54.190> wrapping

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
it around now the reason I'm wrapping

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.690 
it around now the reason I'm wrapping
first<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.180> egg<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.380> sides<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.890> because

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
first the egg on the sides is because

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.570 
first the egg on the sides is because
the<00:02:57.910> tape<00:02:58.209> sticks<00:02:58.690> very<00:02:59.050> good<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.370> it's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
the tape sticks very good to it and it's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.340 
the tape sticks very good to it and it's
going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.880> create<00:03:01.120> better<00:03:01.720> than<00:03:02.110> just

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
going to create better than just

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.080 
going to create better than just
sticking<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.340> start<00:03:03.580> taping<00:03:03.850> it

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
sticking it on and start taping it

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.740 
sticking it on and start taping it
around<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.890> take<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.280> slight<00:03:06.750> larger

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
around then you can take a slight larger

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.120 
around then you can take a slight larger
or<00:03:07.959> thicker<00:03:08.560> would<00:03:09.370> say<00:03:09.580> tape<00:03:10.860> again<00:03:11.860> you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
or thicker would say tape again you

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.640 
or thicker would say tape again you
don't<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> cut<00:03:12.670> too<00:03:12.940> much<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.650> because

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
don't want to cut too much of it because

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.050 
don't want to cut too much of it because
then<00:03:14.890> you're<00:03:15.040> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.220> be<00:03:15.370> folding<00:03:15.760> around

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
then you're going to be folding around

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.560 
then you're going to be folding around
