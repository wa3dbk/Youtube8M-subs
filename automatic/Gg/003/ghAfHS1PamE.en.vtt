00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
half of the deck and take a 20-metre

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the fishing line I just throw it through

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.480 
the fishing line I just throw it through
the<00:00:15.960> center<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> deck<00:00:16.770> if<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.130> use<00:00:17.160> by

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.670 
the center of the deck if you use by
school<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:17.970> should<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.990> more<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.500> just

school there should be one more we just
ate<00:00:19.800> your<00:00:19.949> theme<00:00:20.189> because<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> won't<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.760> able

through the sensor and then to cut it

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
through the sensor and then to cut it
off<00:00:26.880> once<00:00:27.269> you've<00:00:27.510> done<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.650> double

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
wouldn't be able to so just found the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.959 
wouldn't be able to so just found the
top<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:56.420> whatever<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.660> pic<00:00:57.930> say<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> was

top and then whatever the pic say it was

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.750 
top and then whatever the pic say it was
three<00:00:59.969> parts<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.379> when<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> drill<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
three parts and when you drill down to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
three parts and when you drill down to
let<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.180> pick<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.539> pick<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.290> start

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
let them pick it pick it right start

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.450 
let them pick it pick it right start
whittling<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.119> say<00:01:06.330> stop<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.619> once<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
whittling and then say stop so once so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
whittling and then say stop so once so
by<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> time<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.150> say<00:01:09.330> stop<00:01:09.600> you're<00:01:09.930> already

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
by the time they say stop you're already

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
by the time they say stop you're already
into<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.520> string<00:01:11.760> cast<00:01:12.060> by<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.900> wrong<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.880> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
into the string cast by the wrong way so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.200 
into the string cast by the wrong way so
let's<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.840> number<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> full<00:01:16.500> stop<00:01:17.210> right

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
let's do that number a full stop right

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
let's do that number a full stop right
there<00:01:18.390> push<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.280> show<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
there push it in just show it like you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
there push it in just show it like you
would<00:01:21.299> normally<00:01:21.479> fish<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:21.930> card<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.290> might

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
would normally fish your card in might

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.080 
would normally fish your card in might
take<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> bit<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> force<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.970> able

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
take a bit of force but you will be able

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.160 
take a bit of force but you will be able
to<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.479> what<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.960> on

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to do it and then what we need to do on

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.539 
to do it and then what we need to do on
letting<00:01:28.500> down<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> table<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.310> much

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
letting down the table because it's much

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
letting down the table because it's much
easier<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.270> without<00:01:30.960> doing<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> table

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
easier to see without doing on the table

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
easier to see without doing on the table
if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.610> hold<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> put

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
if you hold it down then going to put

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.620 
if you hold it down then going to put
their<00:01:34.110> finger<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.740> top<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> deck<00:01:35.630> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
their finger on the top of the deck just

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.800 
their finger on the top of the deck just
pull<00:01:36.990> sideways<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.210> deck<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> move<00:01:39.570> for

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
pull sideways and the deck we move for

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.499 
pull sideways and the deck we move for
us<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.950> once<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.250> moves<00:01:41.460> forwards<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.150> little

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
us and once it's moves forwards a little

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
us and once it's moves forwards a little
bit<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:43.920> half<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.990> stop<00:01:47.000> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
bit look what half and just stop and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.310 
bit look what half and just stop and
then<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.990> push<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.320> first

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
then you can push down on the first

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.859 
then you can push down on the first
endpoint<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> top<00:01:54.030> half<00:01:54.270> away<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
endpoint of the top half away from you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.929 
endpoint of the top half away from you
and<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.799> will<00:01:55.979> cause<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.909> bit

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and that will cause this to go up a bit

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.230 
and that will cause this to go up a bit
and<00:01:57.409> then<00:01:58.409> when<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> pull<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> show<00:01:59.240> sharply

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and then when you pull the show sharply

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480 
and then when you pull the show sharply
just<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.070> actually

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
just like that then they actually

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.539 
just like that then they actually
karbonn<00:02:02.939> come<00:02:03.150> shooting<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.549> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
karbonn come shooting out about that and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100 
karbonn come shooting out about that and
then<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:05.939> turn<00:02:06.270> revealing<00:02:06.720> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
then you can just turn revealing and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
then you can just turn revealing and
then<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.350> their<00:02:07.530> cars<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> there's<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
then it's their cars so there's the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.370 
then it's their cars so there's the
thermostat<00:02:10.229> ok<00:02:10.590> hit<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.220> it
