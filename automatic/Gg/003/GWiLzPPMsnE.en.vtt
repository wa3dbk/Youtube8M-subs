00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.409 
pieces of angle iron that I just drove
some<00:00:30.320> holes<00:00:30.529> in<00:00:30.830> that<00:00:31.580> go<00:00:31.670> on<00:00:31.820> either<00:00:32.059> side<00:00:32.390> of

what<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:27.140> now<00:02:27.260> loose

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.970 

and<00:02:40.299> we'll<00:02:40.450> let<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.689> sit<00:02:40.840> like<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.019> for<00:02:41.920> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
and we'll let it sit like that for a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.130 
and we'll let it sit like that for a
little<00:02:42.159> while<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.849> let<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.180> kind<00:02:43.719> of<00:02:43.810> adjust

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
little while and let it kind of adjust

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.530 
little while and let it kind of adjust
