thirty Seconds sixteenth of what have
you<00:00:27.050> you'll<00:00:28.050> notice<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> tempos<00:00:29.429> are

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
you you'll notice that the tempos are

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.709 
you you'll notice that the tempos are
given<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:31.109> know<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:32.239> MIDI<00:00:33.239> drum<00:00:33.510> loops

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
can get stretched as far as you want but

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
can get stretched as far as you want but
we<00:00:35.790> recorded<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.450> certain<00:00:36.630> temples<00:00:37.110> in

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
we recorded them with certain temples in

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
we recorded them with certain temples in

165<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.980> may<00:00:47.129> want<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> bump<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
165 and you may want to bump them up to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.770 
165 and you may want to bump them up to
warm<00:00:48.270> 200<00:00:49.200> ppm<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.360> it<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.539> won't<00:00:51.660> be

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
warm 200 ppm and it just won't be

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.660 
warm 200 ppm and it just won't be
humanly<00:00:52.320> possible<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> tried<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> give

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
humanly possible so we tried to give

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209 
humanly possible so we tried to give
them<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> tempo<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:55.920> were<00:00:56.010> actually

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
them the tempo that they were actually

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.729 
them the tempo that they were actually
recorded<00:00:56.879> at<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.300> would<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.559> make

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
recorded at and would actually make

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.260 
recorded at and would actually make
sense
