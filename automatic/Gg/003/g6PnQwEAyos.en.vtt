signal this is a 2 wire method as
opposed<00:00:16.449> to<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:16.720> 1<00:00:16.869> wire<00:00:17.050> method<00:00:17.289> that<00:00:17.589> I

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
opposed to the 1 wire method that I

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.950 
opposed to the 1 wire method that I
found<00:00:17.949> all<00:00:18.099> over<00:00:18.279> the<00:00:18.369> place<00:00:18.580> I<00:00:19.060> didn't<00:00:19.839> like

how<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.680> do<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:35.950> and<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:36.910> only<00:00:37.030> takes<00:00:37.270> a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
how to do that and it only takes a

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.600 
how to do that and it only takes a
couple<00:00:37.510> minutes<00:00:37.770> here's<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.950> extremely

have this wire free so once you have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800 
have this wire free so once you have
this<00:02:31.739> free<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> black<00:02:33.330> wire<00:02:33.600> and
