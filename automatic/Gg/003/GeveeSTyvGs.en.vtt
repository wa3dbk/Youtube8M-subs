00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.799 

all<00:00:08.730> right<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.000> here's<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.240> circuit<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.719> I

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
all right so here's the circuit that I

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.860 
all right so here's the circuit that I
drew<00:00:10.050> up<00:00:10.200> delay<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.280> relay<00:00:11.639> circuit<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.719> if<00:00:12.780> you

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
drew up delay on relay circuit so if you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.030 
drew up delay on relay circuit so if you
have<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> circuit<00:00:13.380> where<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> want<00:00:13.740> too<00:00:13.830> light

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
have a circuit where you want too light

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.700 
have a circuit where you want too light
to<00:00:14.250> be<00:00:14.280> delayed<00:00:14.759> before<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.509> comes<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
to be delayed before it comes on this is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
to be delayed before it comes on this is
what<00:00:16.830> you're<00:00:16.920> looking<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.359> 12

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
what you're looking for you have 12

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.019 
what you're looking for you have 12
volts<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.140> through<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> switch<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:20.730> would

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
volts going through a switch which would

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.980 
volts going through a switch which would
activate<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> circuit<00:00:22.580> going<00:00:23.580> through<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.990> 401

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
activate the circuit going through a 401

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.990 
activate the circuit going through a 401
diode<00:00:25.439> which<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.430> necessary

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
diode which is not really necessary

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
diode which is not really necessary
because<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> switch<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.500> when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
because you do have a switch and when

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
because you do have a switch and when
this<00:00:29.460> capacitor<00:00:30.210> charges<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.050> cannot<00:00:31.500> go

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this capacitor charges it cannot go

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
this capacitor charges it cannot go
backwards<00:00:32.160> once<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> switches<00:00:32.759> open<00:00:33.350> but

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
backwards once the switches open but

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
backwards once the switches open but
it's<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> hurt<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> leave<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.020> flows

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it's not going to hurt to leave it flows

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.479 
it's not going to hurt to leave it flows
through<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.410> diode<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.329> through<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> 47<00:00:40.230> K

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
through the diode in through a 47 K

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.790 
through the diode in through a 47 K
which<00:00:41.489> slowly<00:00:42.030> charges<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:42.989> capacitor<00:00:43.620> up

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
which slowly charges this capacitor up

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
which slowly charges this capacitor up
so<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.610> time<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.239> charge

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
so it's going to take time to charge

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
so it's going to take time to charge
this<00:00:45.750> capacitor<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.250> where<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> delay

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this capacitor this is where the delay

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.049 
this capacitor this is where the delay
on<00:00:47.879> comes<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.829> slowly<00:00:50.190> charges<00:00:50.940> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
on comes in so as it slowly charges this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.380 
on comes in so as it slowly charges this
capacitor<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:52.039> it<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.489> once<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> capacitor

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
capacitor up it then once the capacitor

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.420 
capacitor up it then once the capacitor
charges<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.879> go<00:00:57.180> through<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> 20<00:00:58.079> K

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
charges will will go through the 20 K

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.299 
charges will will go through the 20 K
resistor<00:00:59.430> into<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> base<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.690> transistor

you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.270> adjust<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.930> duration<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.650> how<00:01:11.220> long

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
you can adjust the duration of how long

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
you can adjust the duration of how long
it<00:01:11.520> takes<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> delay<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:13.110> increasing<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it takes the delay on by increasing the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.300 
it takes the delay on by increasing the
value<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> 1000<00:01:16.530> micro<00:01:16.799> farad<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
value you can put a 1000 micro farad in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.120 
value you can put a 1000 micro farad in
place<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> 470<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.630> you'll<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.770> little

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
place of a 470 and you'll have a little

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
place of a 470 and you'll have a little
more<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.580> double<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> time<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> takes

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
more than double the time that it takes

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
more than double the time that it takes
to<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> circuit<00:01:24.030> come<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to have the circuit come on

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.160 
to have the circuit come on
once<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.080> initially<00:01:25.560> triggered<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> say<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
once it's initially triggered so say you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.950 
once it's initially triggered so say you
get<00:01:28.439> into<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.829> car<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
get into your car and you don't want to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
get into your car and you don't want to
have<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> light<00:01:31.500> come<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.159> away<00:01:32.430> when

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
have the light come on right away when

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.200 
have the light come on right away when
the<00:01:32.700> door<00:01:32.880> opens<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.810> privacy<00:01:34.200> reasons<00:01:35.210> so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the door opens for privacy reasons so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.490 
the door opens for privacy reasons so
what<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> would<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.079> would<00:01:37.110> set<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
what you would do is you would set this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
what you would do is you would set this
for<00:01:37.710> maybe<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.979> 6<00:01:38.490> seconds<00:01:38.909> before<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.299> light

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
for maybe like 6 seconds before a light

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.200 
for maybe like 6 seconds before a light
would<00:01:39.659> come<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
would come on so if you do want the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.270 
would come on so if you do want the
light<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> come<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.619> open<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.950> car

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
light to come on you would open your car

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.700 
light to come on you would open your car
door<00:01:44.310> slowly<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> wait<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> few<00:01:45.899> extra<00:01:46.290> seconds

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
door slowly and wait a few extra seconds

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.960 
door slowly and wait a few extra seconds
and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.159> interior<00:01:47.549> light<00:01:47.790> would<00:01:47.939> come

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and then your interior light would come

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.060 
and then your interior light would come
on<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.020> could<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.380> what's<00:01:49.590> inside<00:01:49.740> your

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
on and you could see what's inside your

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.850 
on and you could see what's inside your
car<00:01:50.310> before<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> close<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> door<00:01:51.680> but<00:01:52.680> there

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
car before you close the door but there

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.170 
car before you close the door but there
are<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> lot<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.220> people<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> prefer<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
are a lot of people that prefer not to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.850 
are a lot of people that prefer not to
have<00:01:54.420> their<00:01:54.659> interior<00:01:55.140> light<00:01:55.320> come<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> when

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
have their interior light come on when

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
have their interior light come on when
they<00:01:55.950> open<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> door<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they open the door so this would be a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.010 
they open the door so this would be a
handy<00:01:57.689> circuit<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.930> would

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
handy circuit for that so what you would

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.800 
handy circuit for that so what you would
do<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.409> you'd<00:02:01.530> open<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.979> car<00:02:02.159> door<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.810> if

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
do is you'd open your car door and if

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.350 
do is you'd open your car door and if
you<00:02:03.960> open<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> car<00:02:05.130> door<00:02:05.399> quickly<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:06.270> like

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you open the car door quickly just like

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.850 
you open the car door quickly just like
you're<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> routinely<00:02:07.170> open<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
you're going to routinely open it and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.710 
you're going to routinely open it and
get<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> light<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.330> come<00:02:09.539> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
get in then the light will not come on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.930 
get in then the light will not come on
which<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> better<00:02:10.950> than<00:02:11.129> having<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.550> circuit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
which is better than having the circuit

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.550 
which is better than having the circuit
turned<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:13.020> inside

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.490 
Carr who's a lot of people will
deactivate<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.989> circuit<00:02:16.290> from<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
deactivate the circuit from the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.010 
deactivate the circuit from the
dashboard<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.270> when<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.360> open<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.690> close<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
dashboard so when you open the close the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.890 
dashboard so when you open the close the
doors<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.500> will<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.800> come<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:21.720> this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
doors it will not come on so with this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.740 
doors it will not come on so with this
circuit<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.640> come<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.060> but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
circuit you can have it not come on but

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.750

schematic to demonstrate I'm going to
use<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.630> 470<00:04:36.630> micro<00:04:36.990> farad<00:04:37.350> first<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:38.760> you'll

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
use a 470 micro farad first so you'll

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.909 
use a 470 micro farad first so you'll
see<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.330> once<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.780> circuit<00:04:40.200> is<00:04:40.320> triggered

else<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.419> want<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.690> control<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.169> activate<00:04:52.880> so

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
else you want to control to activate so

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.560 
else you want to control to activate so
I'm<00:04:53.970> going<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.150> do<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.940> this<00:04:56.940> one<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.360> set

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
I'm going to do this and this one is set

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:09.939 
I'm going to do this and this one is set
for<00:04:57.720> about<00:04:57.870> 12<00:04:58.200> seconds

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.420 

here<00:05:10.949> you<00:05:11.039> go

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
here you go

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.550 
here you go
it's<00:05:12.300> now<00:05:12.479> set<00:05:14.360> alarm<00:05:15.360> is<00:05:15.539> running<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.080> relays

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
it's now set alarm is running and relays

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.870 
it's now set alarm is running and relays
on<00:05:18.289> so<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.410> vary<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.039> time<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.729> would

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
on so to vary the time that you would

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.689 
on so to vary the time that you would
require<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:22.560> best<00:05:22.800> way<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.009> do<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.430> would<00:05:23.639> be

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
require the best way to do that would be

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.580 
require the best way to do that would be
with<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.120> value<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.080> electrolytic

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
with the value of the electrolytic

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.279 
with the value of the electrolytic
capacitor<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:27.600> I'm<00:05:27.690> going<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.840> remove<00:05:28.080> that

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
capacitor so I'm going to remove that

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.219 
capacitor so I'm going to remove that
one<00:05:29.539> now<00:05:30.539> I'm<00:05:30.630> going<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.840> put<00:05:30.990> in<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.820> 1000<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:33.229> am

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
one now I'm going to put in a 1000 I am

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.580 
one now I'm going to put in a 1000 I am
now<00:05:34.410> going<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:35.449> activate<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.600> circuit<00:05:37.020> just

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
now going to activate the circuit just

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.900 
now going to activate the circuit just
like<00:05:37.740> you're<00:05:37.949> turning<00:05:38.250> on<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.370> light<00:05:38.490> switch

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
like you're turning on a light switch

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.730 
like you're turning on a light switch
and<00:05:39.150> we're<00:05:39.750> going<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:39.900> see<00:05:40.080> how<00:05:40.199> long<00:05:40.259> it<00:05:40.440> takes

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
and we're going to see how long it takes

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.400 
and we're going to see how long it takes
the<00:05:40.889> light<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.250> actually<00:05:41.430> come<00:05:41.729> on<00:05:42.229> this<00:05:43.229> one

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
the light to actually come on this one

00:05:43.410 --> 00:06:03.170 
the light to actually come on this one
is<00:05:43.530> roughly<00:05:43.740> 30<00:05:44.070> seconds

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.490 

there<00:06:03.780> you<00:06:03.840> go<00:06:04.259> real<00:06:04.830> aegis<00:06:05.160> activated<00:06:06.500> alarms

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
there you go real aegis activated alarms

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.659 
there you go real aegis activated alarms
going<00:06:08.389> so<00:06:09.389> as<00:06:09.539> you<00:06:09.660> can<00:06:09.750> see<00:06:13.100> the<00:06:14.100> value<00:06:14.490> of<00:06:14.520> the

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
going so as you can see the value of the

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.499 
going so as you can see the value of the
capacitor<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.300> higher<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.620> value<00:06:17.130> the

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
capacitor the higher the value the

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.360 
capacitor the higher the value the
longer<00:06:18.509> it<00:06:18.630> takes<00:06:18.810> to<00:06:19.080> charge<00:06:19.350> that<00:06:19.710> capacitor

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
longer it takes to charge that capacitor

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.460 
longer it takes to charge that capacitor
before<00:06:20.789> it<00:06:20.880> dumps<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.389> charge<00:06:21.690> into<00:06:22.199> the<00:06:22.289> base

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
before it dumps the charge into the base

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.949 
before it dumps the charge into the base
of<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.770> transistor
