pair rifle we've got a target 20 yards
down<00:00:39.200> range<00:00:39.340> now<00:00:40.340> keep<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.790> mind<00:00:41.030> with<00:00:41.210> the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
down range now keep in mind with the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.569 
down range now keep in mind with the
accuracy<00:00:41.660> of<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.020> that<00:00:42.350> I'm<00:00:42.829> only<00:00:43.070> shooting

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.690 
accuracy of this that I'm only shooting
with<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:44.590> bird<00:00:45.590> barrel<00:00:45.950> it's<00:00:46.100> just<00:00:46.250> got<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.430> bead

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
with a bird barrel it's just got a bead

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.400 
with a bird barrel it's just got a bead
front<00:00:47.030> sight<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.629> don't<00:00:47.780> have<00:00:47.899> a<00:00:47.930> rear<00:00:48.170> sight

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
front sight so I don't have a rear sight

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.690 
front sight so I don't have a rear sight
to<00:00:48.620> light<00:00:48.770> them<00:00:48.890> up<00:00:48.980> on<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.309> I'm<00:00:49.399> going<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.610> do

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
to light them up on but I'm going to do

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.790 
to light them up on but I'm going to do
the<00:00:49.820> best<00:00:49.969> I<00:00:50.120> can<00:00:50.200> so<00:00:51.200> let's<00:00:51.379> go<00:00:51.559> ahead<00:00:51.680> and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
the best I can so let's go ahead and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:02.220 
the best I can so let's go ahead and
give<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.190> try<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.520> see<00:00:52.700> what<00:00:52.789> happens

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.549

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.290

so<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.800> can<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.580> fire<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> slug

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
so as you can see it will fire a slug

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:18.249 
so as you can see it will fire a slug
without<00:01:06.630> any<00:01:06.869> ramifications

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.840 

now<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> recoil<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
now the recoil on this one is a little

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
now the recoil on this one is a little
bit<00:01:21.030> stout<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.080> such<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> small<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
bit stout because it's such a small and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.870 
bit stout because it's such a small and
light<00:01:23.130> gun

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:39.610

[Music]

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.889 

there<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.640> go<00:01:52.970> five<00:01:53.180> rounds<00:01:53.540> of<00:01:53.600> slugs

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
there you go five rounds of slugs

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.929 
there you go five rounds of slugs
through<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.259> rossi<00:01:54.649> matched<00:01:54.890> pair<00:01:55.280> 20<00:01:55.759> gauge

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
through the rossi matched pair 20 gauge

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.440 
through the rossi matched pair 20 gauge
shotgun<00:01:55.970> barrel<00:01:56.869> all<00:01:57.770> right<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:58.280> we're<00:01:59.000> 20

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
shotgun barrel all right so we're 20

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.770 
shotgun barrel all right so we're 20
yards<00:01:59.750> down<00:01:59.810> range<00:01:59.960> now<00:02:00.439> these<00:02:00.680> are<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
yards down range now these are the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.929 
yards down range now these are the
rifled<00:02:02.780> slugs<00:02:03.140> out<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.799> Rossi<00:02:04.430> match<00:02:04.610> pair

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
rifled slugs out of the Rossi match pair

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.359 
rifled slugs out of the Rossi match pair
20<00:02:05.299> gauge<00:02:05.479> barrel<00:02:05.869> there's<00:02:06.590> two<00:02:06.890> in<00:02:07.039> this<00:02:07.159> hole

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
20 gauge barrel there's two in this hole

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.070 
20 gauge barrel there's two in this hole
here<00:02:07.700> then<00:02:08.060> there's<00:02:08.239> two<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.660> hole<00:02:08.810> here

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
here then there's two in this hole here

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.559 
here then there's two in this hole here
and<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:09.920> right<00:02:10.099> here<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.940> that's<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.360> bad

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
and one right here so that's not a bad

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.330 
and one right here so that's not a bad
group<00:02:11.840> with<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.440> using<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.890> front<00:02:13.130> bead

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
group with just using the front bead

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.890 
group with just using the front bead
sight<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.940> was<00:02:14.060> no<00:02:14.209> rear<00:02:14.420> sight<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.870> that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
sight there was no rear sight on that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.530 
sight there was no rear sight on that
gun<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.980> those<00:02:16.640> would<00:02:16.819> tighten<00:02:17.060> up<00:02:17.239> quite<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
gun so those would tighten up quite a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.050 
gun so those would tighten up quite a
bit<00:02:17.780> if<00:02:18.459> there<00:02:19.459> was<00:02:19.580> some<00:02:19.730> other<00:02:19.880> type<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
bit if there was some other type of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.820 
bit if there was some other type of
sighting<00:02:20.480> system<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.620> I'm<00:02:21.709> pretty

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
sighting system on there so I'm pretty

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.410 
sighting system on there so I'm pretty
happy<00:02:21.950> with<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.549> they're<00:02:22.760> lined<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.209> pretty

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
happy with that they're lined up pretty

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.770 
happy with that they're lined up pretty
much<00:02:24.400> vertically<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:26.360> couple<00:02:26.510> of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
much vertically here and a couple of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.699 
much vertically here and a couple of
them<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.049> same<00:02:27.260> hole

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
them in the same hole

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.770 
them in the same hole
