phone comeback after I'd shot a doe with
the<00:03:56.319> phone<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:57.269> think<00:03:58.269> that<00:03:58.390> does<00:03:58.690> laying<00:03:59.050> down

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
the phone I think that does laying down

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.949 
the phone I think that does laying down
not<00:03:59.530> too<00:03:59.739> far<00:04:00.010> away<00:04:00.129> so<00:04:00.660> hopefully<00:04:01.660> it'll<00:04:01.780> be

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
not too far away so hopefully it'll be

00:04:01.959 --> 00:05:07.880 
not too far away so hopefully it'll be

her about 15-20 minutes later she didn't
go<00:07:13.210> too<00:07:13.270> far<00:07:13.750> but<00:07:14.550> yeah<00:07:15.550> I<00:07:15.610> had<00:07:15.789> to<00:07:15.939> give<00:07:16.090> it

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
go too far but yeah I had to give it

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.749 
go too far but yeah I had to give it
overnight<00:07:16.629> and<00:07:16.659> I<00:07:16.960> still<00:07:17.229> was<00:07:17.349> able<00:07:17.500> to<00:07:17.729> get<00:07:18.729> a

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
overnight and I still was able to get a

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.040 
overnight and I still was able to get a
good<00:07:19.000> portion<00:07:19.389> of<00:07:19.479> the<00:07:19.569> meat<00:07:19.779> off<00:07:19.810> of<00:07:19.960> her<00:07:20.289> so<00:07:21.069> I

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
good portion of the meat off of her so I

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.379 
good portion of the meat off of her so I
guess<00:07:23.050> that<00:07:23.289> concludes<00:07:23.800> it<00:07:24.029> when<00:07:25.029> you're<00:07:25.240> not

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
guess that concludes it when you're not

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.089 
guess that concludes it when you're not
sure<00:07:25.629> about<00:07:25.779> your<00:07:26.319> deer<00:07:26.529> where<00:07:26.740> you<00:07:26.860> hit<00:07:27.069> it

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:29.379 
and you can't fault that we can't follow

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:33.119 
and you can't fault that we can't follow
the<00:07:29.589> blood<00:07:29.770> just<00:07:29.800> give<00:07:30.219> it<00:07:30.279> a<00:07:30.339> little<00:07:30.430> time<00:07:32.129> we

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.129 
the blood just give it a little time we

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:35.010
