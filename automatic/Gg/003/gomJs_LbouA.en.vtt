00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.920 
two things here
both<00:03:52.790> these<00:03:53.030> tabs<00:03:53.300> actually<00:03:53.660> have<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.840> be

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
both these tabs actually have to be

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.240 
both these tabs actually have to be
unclipped<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.380> was<00:03:54.470> trying<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.740> pull<00:03:54.890> against

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
unclipped I was trying to pull against

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.040 
unclipped I was trying to pull against
it<00:03:55.400> they<00:03:55.610> weren't<00:03:55.790> coming<00:03:55.970> out<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.870> that's

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
it they weren't coming out so that's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.420 
it they weren't coming out so that's
what<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.290> got<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.440> do<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.890> then<00:03:58.070> after<00:03:58.280> that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
what you got to do and then after that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.300 
what you got to do and then after that
it's<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.760> nice<00:03:58.940> easy<00:03:59.180> pull<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.660> and<00:04:00.650> just<00:04:01.100> comes

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's a nice easy pull out and just comes

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:15.610 
it's a nice easy pull out and just comes
out<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:13.600> still<00:04:14.600> think<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:14.870> she<00:04:15.050> does<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.290> little

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
out I still think that she does a little

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.320 
out I still think that she does a little
bit<00:04:15.920> easier<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:16.549> is<00:04:16.700> not<00:04:16.880> all<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.030> easy<00:04:17.180> to

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
bit easier this is not all that easy to

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.750 
bit easier this is not all that easy to
unbox<00:04:17.660> it<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:18.140> guess<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.190> could<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:19.340> pull<00:04:19.609> it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
unbox it I guess you could just pull it

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.240 
unbox it I guess you could just pull it
a<00:04:19.820> rip<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.090> tear<00:04:20.330> if<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:20.600> want<00:04:22.330> otherwise

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
a rip and tear if you want otherwise

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.410 
a rip and tear if you want otherwise
yeah<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.580> not<00:04:25.730> even<00:04:25.820> gonna<00:04:26.000> fit<00:04:26.210> through

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
yeah this is not even gonna fit through

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.550 
yeah this is not even gonna fit through
there<00:04:26.540> at<00:04:26.690> all<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:27.140> you're<00:04:27.230> gonna<00:04:27.320> have<00:04:27.470> to

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
there at all so you're gonna have to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.350 
there at all so you're gonna have to
actually<00:04:27.680> go<00:04:27.950> ahead<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.160> unstrap<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.090> cable

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
actually go ahead and unstrap the cable

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.450 
actually go ahead and unstrap the cable
to<00:04:29.420> pull<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.690> out<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.830> form<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.340> it

to pull it out and the form that it

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.860 
to pull it out and the form that it
comes<00:04:31.640> in<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:31.970> won't<00:04:32.120> fit<00:04:32.300> out<00:04:32.450> so<00:04:32.720> you're

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870
