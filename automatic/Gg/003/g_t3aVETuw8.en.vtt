00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
the back is a little bit different from

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.140 
the back is a little bit different from
the<00:05:43.169> actual<00:05:43.349> pup<00:05:44.189> itself<00:05:44.639> because<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:44.939> thought

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
the actual pup itself because I thought

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.820 
the actual pup itself because I thought
you'd<00:05:45.389> be<00:05:45.509> able<00:05:45.569> to<00:05:45.659> move<00:05:45.839> his<00:05:46.020> legs<00:05:46.319> and<00:05:46.650> that

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
you'd be able to move his legs and that

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.350 
you'd be able to move his legs and that
would<00:05:46.949> have<00:05:47.039> been<00:05:47.159> a<00:05:47.189> nice<00:05:47.460> add-on<00:05:47.759> but

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
would have been a nice add-on but

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.239 
would have been a nice add-on but
unfortunately<00:05:48.990> you<00:05:49.169> can't<00:05:49.409> do<00:05:49.589> that<00:05:49.740> but<00:05:50.159> the

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 
unfortunately you can't do that but the

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.010 
unfortunately you can't do that but the
overall<00:05:50.520> detail<00:05:50.939> is<00:05:51.060> really<00:05:51.300> nice<00:05:51.479> if<00:05:51.719> you<00:05:51.839> get

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
overall detail is really nice if you get

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.170 
overall detail is really nice if you get
a<00:05:52.050> little<00:05:52.409> one<00:05:52.529> that<00:05:52.589> law's<00:05:53.069> paw<00:05:53.610> Patrol
