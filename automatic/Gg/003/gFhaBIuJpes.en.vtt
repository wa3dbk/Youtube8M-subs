00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.870
 which is a project 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.070

 it's the resources to produce it 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.010
 in that case the resource and the unit is a poplar plantation of eja art 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.259
 table is practically built on site 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.020
