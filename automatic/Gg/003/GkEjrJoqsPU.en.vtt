00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.170
 150 seater German airline crash 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:20.150
 Spain's Barcelona Normal Germany Western Dusseldorf Dusseldorf's German cheap airline 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:26.270
 Well then the national sport of wings crashed in the mountainous area of ​​southeastern France 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:33.050
 It seems that 150 people were on board in the same period, and there was no manufacturer information and all were sacrificed. 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.890
 That's what fear is two Japanese tatami room, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also that there has been 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 What 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.140
 I wish this I this cheap Ii' softening problem 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.250
 This plane itself is already 14 years 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.980
 Flying Is So not a corresponding old I Nde say Rutte 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.290
 But I do not know in detail It was, but I how much sucking of that airplane to the corresponding 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.070
 While Well so-called cockpit after Well optimization to rapidly that maneuver from it 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 School 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.120
 Ikunda I Well teacher of that essay Department put out cat of aircraft I mean Oo and manufacturers 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.320
 According to something 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:13.390
 For it and mass are not familiar very this 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.580
 When and leak say and do anything in the mower Rutteyuu root it such that the panic state that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.860
 10,000 meters this 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.070
 Sudden descent in a few minutes This is why this seems to be increasing such accidents 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.580
 Recently 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.740
 This is good 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:34.270
 For example , I think that a personal computer that uses amniotic fluid, such as Nemuri, is one 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.980
 I'm going to be a Zhou junior, I just have to buy new ones 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:44.570
 Some kind of display comes out, but a little different 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:50.479
 If this operation is done, it is high-tech but it detects a virus 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.990
 I Then to Toka or stuck that in response to a variety that 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.210
 Also, I'm trying to fix that in various ways. 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.630
 Early the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.490
 Well Soso that with that operation is also funny 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.030
 There are also many instructions coming out, so I'm kind of that kind of student 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.780
 I have a part-time job, so I can not get drunk on the laboratory 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.380
 Then I wonder if this will lock up on that vegetarian diet 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.230
 I would like to go back here and release this and then do this 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.019
 I will do it 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:26.000
 For example , if you fly into a drool, why not why? 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:30.769
 When the lamp comes out that the neighbor is overheated , this is because it did a different operation 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.220
 Even if you believe it, the engine may melt and you 're heated 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:41.490
 And that engine has stopped for a while and descents 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:47.010
 I guess it's on the 2nd floor so it 's a group to get used to it properly 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.590
 Even when called or cheap aircraft company is not we do not take enough time to reduce costs 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.930
 It was a photo because it was cutting something 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.260
 I agree 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 I'm this 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:04.360
 But it is those who say 1% for those standing was 5000 yen standing giving me Hey good 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:07.659
 I've come here, but it's great, I'm in light clothes and I belong, so it's cheap and I already have my hands safe 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.460
 Though there is no need to pull it out 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:15.780
 After all this kind of accident happens a little 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.130
 Although not what both I do not know that I think you'll ne me I really still full story and a wonder if outrageous 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.380
 Though 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.350
 It seems that this is not going to be with Kyoro. 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.830
 It is so when the case is second round I'm so I thought 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.830
 true 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.769
 me 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.690
 me 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.730
 me
