00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.010
 my name is 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.480
 I am the group with economists and 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.410
 I want to talk about the topic today 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.960
 account regulation introduce the term 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.939
 the temperature regulation covers all 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.699
 mechanisms of our body the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.860
 core temperature constant upright 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.199
 especially when changing 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.489
 ambient temperatures and 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.870
 Environmental conditions 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.960
 we have an optimal 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.000
 operating temperature of 37 degrees celsius 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.649
 In this area can metabolism 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.430
 reactions such as the extreme 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.469
 work or the binding affinity of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.200
 oxygen-hemoglobin to the best 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.660
 work is why the body strives 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.180
 to take all possible measures 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.809
 this body temperature upright 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:09.520
 receive 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:16.850
 our hypothalamus tax center for 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:19.909
 the temperature regulation of the thalamus 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.570
 has a couple of receptors in check 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.549
 the check whether that is the will that is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.049
 If not, this is the case 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.700
 Take measures to adjust 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:39.920
 The heat production in peace happens so 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.670
 more than 70 percent in our inner 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.670
 organs 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:57.759
 and only about 18 percent in the engines in 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:01.280
 the skin during physical activity 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:06.709
 This relationship changes when 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.610
 physical activity becomes the 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:15.110
 Temperature over more than 90 percent of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.230
 Musculature also produces tremors 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.810
 a possibility temperatures in cooking 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.629
 to produce by the muscles 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.230
 working is important to know 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.879
 if the body shakes then the must 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.790
 muscle be supplied with blood 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.650
 if I withdraw blood from the chapel and 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.220
 lose it in the extremities 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.530
 I thereby only once body heat and 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.709
 the body core known motor rises 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.190
 only user-muscle also is warm 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.470
 with a reason why especially infants 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.040
 also have older free heat production 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.389
 the own increased brown fat tissue 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.680
 respectively 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.060
 This down effect has lived one 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.010
 greater proportion of treat the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.210
 work harder and strengthen fat 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.050
 burn and therefore strengthen 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.300
 three sentences without such trembling 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.670
 transport learning in the body success 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.520
 through the blood the blood with the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.040
 body heat up and through 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.490
 narrow and white position of the vessels becomes 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.900
 is blood on the kv surface 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.790
 This is what you call yours 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.790
 heat electricity when the heat from the body 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.510
 core is distributed via the blood in 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.520
 the periphery 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 that usually happens to be the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.610
 Temporary skin is one of many skater kerns 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.520
 it continues so that our body always 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.700
 Heat to the environment gives over 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.710
 radiation or heat conduction, the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.400
 is also about providing the 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.380
 vessels bring warm blood to the outside and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.810
 this over the body surface to the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.320
 gives environment to cool the body 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.650
 these measures are no longer sufficient 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 it comes to a process of protection 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.930
 Protecting is always a method of 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.490
 body around the core body temperature 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.210
 to cool down and to keep the body in front 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.530
 To protect overheating and just that 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.770
 Body above this evaporative cold 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.820
 cool 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.320
 Thank you for your attention 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 and wish you all a nice day
