00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.980
 new dofus times devoted a point 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.929
 major update 2 points 29 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.929
 the evolution of the critical strike system 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.260
 small visual modification for 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.759
 start the probability of performing a 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.009
 critical hit is now displayed in 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.860
 percentage then concretely what is this 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.290
 that it changes by is one that you are 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.829
 one in two cc or you have 50% of 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.960
 stop strictly the same thing from 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.090
 blow why are you telling us and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530
 this is where the second change 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.120
 intervenes on the one hand blow rates 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.860
 basic review have been reviewed and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.660
 on the other hand, the increase in the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.249
 critical hit becomes linear for 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.809
 recall the basic criticism rates 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.640
 match the chances of doing a 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.019
 critical hit with a spell without holding 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.269
 account of the bonuses provided by 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.070
 equipment or others without you we 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.109
 always follow super because it's 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.489
 now it gets complicated new 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.170
 basic criticism rates have done is 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.850
 established according to the old ones while 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.079
 maintaining a certain coherence and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.110
 to calculate them a little bit of 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.240
 mathematics is needed 6 mt equal 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.490
 new base rate remained equal 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.510
 old base rate the formula has operated 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.450
 is mt equal percentage 55 - blind 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.420
 missed ok ok it's not very talk like 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.159
 so that's a small example to come out 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.180
 currently at one-thirtieth of 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.490
 base is the equivalent of 3 33% nt equal 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.340
 55 - 1 out of 1 30th 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.860
 so between is equivalent to 25% 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.140
 in other words without additional bonuses you 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.509
 automatically move from 3 elsewhere 33% 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.079
 at 25 % chance to make a move 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.000
 criticism rather colin well let's move on to 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.189
 present at these famous additional bonuses 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.840
 for a critical hit obtained via a 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.369
 equipment or comes out that gives 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.869
 directly 1% chance 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.630
 additional to make a hit 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.670
 addictively critical for example 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.590
 for a spell at 5% base rate 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 the addition of 10 trials will pass this same 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.179
 at 15% chance to perform 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 a critical hit and as I see you 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.130
 come I anticipate if before he was 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.850
 impossible to exceed 1 in 2 cc is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.860
 50% 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.509
 it is now well past and your 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.120
 optimization will allow you to overtake 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.709
 the 50% or even to reach 100% 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.150
 of chance made a critical hit 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.459
 the best for the end the dofus 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.709
 turquoise his bonus now stands at 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.120
 10 sfx and it becomes definitely 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.799
 accessible to all players they 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.989
 will complete the initiated quest series 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.510
 by the witch meriane has an appointment in 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.250
 game more explanations are waiting for you 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.569
 in the devblog and as for us we get 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.610
 will find again very soon for a 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.599
 new fustal explanatory of the 2.29
