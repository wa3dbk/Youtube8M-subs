00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.750
 a little brush 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.730
 it's not easy but it's really the only 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.080
 true and equal of workman and the sand the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.780
 clams always be on the surface 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 but now it's accurate in the sand so 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.539
 the surface of the sea and they are there to live 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 ltd times of course you have very 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.890
 stuck the sand in these parts and you're 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 what are these little streaks so 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 So much has to be washed one by one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 thousands of mesh this as they say do not put 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 to the flour dinner and with that same arrive 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.500
 to leave it for a long time in water and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 we are moving not everything works but 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 it works more really we see it a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.160
 for one with a brush that are 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 species a sense can be bought in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 the little market can buy the bullet 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 benja for something do not do it now another 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.829
 very important thing the mix that is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.740
 closed clam that helps us sometimes 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.740
 they are closed means like this 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.390
 they do serve those that are closed 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.550
 that are completely you know that no 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.220
 we can not open them 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.410
 patterns cartels from the beginning 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.340
 because they are dead see since you were 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.340
 fishing in córdoba 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.170
 there are times when clams are birds like 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.869
 in this house in this case this table goes to 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 open with the heat goes to bridge 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.950
 ok but if you still have the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.869
 suspects and is so little like that close to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.270
 this medium closed and does not open during the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.810
 cooking please discard the also 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.960
 there is death that death does not go 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.030
 exactly very easy to do I'm going to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 put oil I will put butter is 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.890
 the best way that butter does not 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.190
 burn , however, I'm taking oil 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.580
 and I'm going to put garlic 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.910
 with the garlic and nothing else I will perfume my 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.140
 butter I do not want to be given more 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.420
 then yes I already know very well what to put 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.770
 the butter and I also put the garlic not 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.470
 I want them to be browned for no reason 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.150
 to lower the temperature quickly 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.550
 I'm going to put jalapeño pepper can be 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.080
 fresh or the vinegar I suffered it 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.340
 immigrant environment because the taste 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.959
 I think Rich has put 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.959
 let's add tomato 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.500
 we lower the temperature to half 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.590
 if I have to go here I would start to smell 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.780
 so to the court but the horn 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.879
 burnt is totally white as 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.890
 we can see and it's so I want 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.129
 that conserves me and I consume a lot 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.040
 temperature first thing is burning it the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.700
 I'm going to put the clam grater on

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.030
 between them that mix that some 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.030
 of touch a pinch of tomato is 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.780
