00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.690 

also<00:01:55.040> another<00:01:55.580> problem<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:57.700> nike

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
also another problem is the nike

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.940 
also another problem is the nike
applique<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.570> they<00:01:59.689> did<00:01:59.840> on<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.080> tongue<00:02:00.320> it

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
kind of cracks and peels so it's kind of

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.539 
kind of cracks and peels so it's kind of
understandable<00:02:06.140> why<00:02:06.590> these<00:02:06.649> ended<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
understandable why these ended up in the
