00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:02.170
 and good 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.530
 in lisbon the friend of youtube 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.110
 well my name is cristian this doctor and to whom I dedicate it to amc this friend 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.529
 from here 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.919
 by ander mongen 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.259
 This one who has asked him to go in for theft and how to do or fluids with 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.720
 cinema 4d 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.230
 instead of with reflections for queen 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.100
 we see here chicken cinema 4d is very good but instead with fluids 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.550
 best inflated 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.060
 because you can use here 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.740
 in this event in cinema 4d mccann and they are going to be harder 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 i'm not going to mahoma to see also how it is like that makes one 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 the one of knowing another type of fluids 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.840
 well then 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.040
 then we can also do treading 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.400
 client had disappointed I'm going to leave on him in the description of 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.050
 video so that you go to 100 thousand 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.240
 the 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.350
 the impossible in case they want but I'm not going to use not in nor do I have turin 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.980
 but 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.350
 I'm going to leave you and for the one who leaves 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650
 as long as we're going let's start 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.010
 let's create a sphere 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 to that we're going to give a radius of 20 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.600
 the payroll of 25 of 27 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080
 of 31 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 Okay now let's create a TV 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.230
 let's put it is under the emitter 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.470
 let's aim 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.830
 let's put the dreams more or less 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.280
 about 250 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 we were going to go up was rita 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.070
 we are going to fight and take to observe some 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.170
 these particles that are traveling do not 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.860
 in the form of root 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630
 so that we desist to learn we will find the spheres there 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.790
 but to avoid that to be not to give up all the time 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.410
 health and the issuer we were going to activate the option that says show objects 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.430
 here 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.500
 and let's see the spheres 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.250
 we are going again referenced 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 and then let's say lawsuit 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 and we will observe how travel 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.949
 then now we are going to be the following 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.309
 let's create and ibm 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.309
 if we want our rush 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.189
 fall on some bone plan obrador some object 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.669
 and yesterday abc to be fulfilled or not 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.269
 I'm going to put a plane in the hills of the least three hundred indie 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.299
 and the size object I'm going to give the width ten thousand 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.389
 is the size of the grid 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 and in the high also 10 thousand 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 that is also fine from the grid 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.519
 then ischia we put a plan does not mean that 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.419
 that they were crossed that is to say that the sphere is good 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.330
 untill there 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
 but they are going to cross they were going to fall to expiration 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.799
 sales what we are going to do is insert there was a defect 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.129
 because here the dakar deflector 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.529
 nester here 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.869
 where they did coordinated 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.929
 and send pointed perez we will give 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.499
 We are going to give him to look alsea I spent 90no 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.919
 i and in the legs coordinated to work 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.269
 let's put minus 300 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.869
 we give to apply 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:30.829
 now you object does not tell me size and menkes we carry 10 thousand 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 as in the plane and and I also ten thousand 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.459
 we already have doubts 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 Now let's create a 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.569
 no serious 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.840
 this severity we are going to scale a fairly normal modem 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.159
 pretty and without 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.479
 more or less 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.729
 as not as we astutely say we have 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.729
 and in this case I'm going to be a little over a year 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.849
 a little more than a month that the plan 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.179
 the hands of today 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:06.269
 so 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.929
 now we are fighting 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:11.129
 the only thing we have observed a lot of balls dripping not 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.439
 but 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.120
 but they explain but that gift 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.569
 that sphere is do not seem to flow 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.349
 so let's use there was a modeling tool and it's called 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.370
 burriana 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.610
 not the government but her 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.460
 percent 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.469
 the goal to return because there 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.469
 then we put the transmitter below 100 meters bolt 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.129
 and we are going to give you play 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.610
 to the goal goal where it says 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.960
 your editor's division 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.610
 we are going to decrease 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.009
 up to 20 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 although we were going to see that the liquid is bouncing 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.210
 but to which we were to be slaves of the issuer 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.330
 and they say 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.560
 sorry to the effector and he tells me the hobby and we will see 5 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 2nd, let's do a lawsuit 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 if we want we can diminish the ray of waiting 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.309
 or decrease in that says corase value in the metabolism 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.129
 ok then let's see what 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.770
 has crossed the plan not 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.099
 that is, the effect is not 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.099
 that is, the defect is not enough to 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.020
 Holds the weight of the volcanic goal 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.470
 then what we are going to do is lower the plane 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.779
 more or less where is 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.779
 more or less where they are deserted or less here 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.599
 then we are going to 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.839
 let's go up the emitter mos def confinement new 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.080
 namus to upload it 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.080
 and let's give it lee 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:08.460
 victor moses 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.750
 we help more or less a world a kind of frog in the spell 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.509
 plus many curds 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.499
 desire for those spills 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.379
 we can achieve it although 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.709
 It's not so good with a rifle attack that it's much better 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.469
 but 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.469
 lion the park let go or not 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.869
 So I'm going to put a cylinder and so it does not look 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.699
 mckee dynamite look alike 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:43.309
 The spill 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:47.449
 in common it is fecund and syndrome and then they start 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.099
 I'm going to delete the polygons and camps 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.759
 and in fact inner exclusion 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.550
 a month ago by aida and Latvia study 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:04.439
 the more or less around here we see like this 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.080
 I'm going to look at the syndrome a little bit 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.180
 It depends on how you have done it 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.860
 It is still a bad price that has enough 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.659
 but then, that's all 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.259
 and good thank you friends for this one for your attention 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.349
 in the sternum some other cinema tutorial 4d 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.960
 and I hope it serves you 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.809
 rating 

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:37.689
 of the northern monk 

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:40.189
 Jaime subscribed 

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:41.210
 then see you
