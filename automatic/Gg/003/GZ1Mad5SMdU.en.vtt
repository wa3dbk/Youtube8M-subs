 not too hard to get out of your head 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.560
 this is a new year 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.510

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.840
 find you to establish the ones that will 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.399
 to be a sewing tutorial and well 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.829
 obviously the sewing machine will 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.450
 the main element of this video I 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.530
 bought a leggins not long ago 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.000
 it turns out that it's the guides that I'm going 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 very well at the waist level it's up to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.629
 to say that around the waist it's okay 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.860
 in length is perfect but I 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.360
 realized in the story where he 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.070
 must at home that leggins bike 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 a lot at the knees and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 behind the thighs so that's why 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 today I realize this tutorial for 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 show how to readjust to stack leggins 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 at your height 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.579
 I will show you the very good 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.210
 accessory that we will need in addition 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.920
 of the sewing machine leggins that I 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 I'm adjusted for imitation 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.189
 valve is obviously no matter the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.960
 matter in which it does your 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.790
 leggins fit the size of his 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 notebook will be the same whatever happens 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.670
 I'll start right away 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.409
 present the first steps of this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.330
 tutorial to be able to adjust your 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.400
 leggins the first step is to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.990
 put on it for me as I 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.880
 wanted to clarify the leggings I'm going very 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.330
 well at the waist but it's at the level 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 knees so behind that the vegetable 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 let go of them go so we have to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.740
 take your pin and spot where 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 find the seam on your leggings 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 for me the sewing is at 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.110
 inside my leggins it's here that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.479
 the needles will come to position themselves 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 I will take several needle I 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.600
 will position on my leggins in 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.399
 depending on the part that there will be at 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.079
 cut our do not you plan anyway 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.189
 the hymn this too tight because otherwise 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.420
 you may not be able to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.420
 return your leg after 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.780
 once the needles are 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.149
 positioned we will be able to remove our 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.409
 liggins to then go to powder the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.560
 everything at first we're going 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.709
 to take care of cutting along the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 sewing that lies between the legs 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.300
 all along our needle 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.969
 once sewing 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.860
 to recut on each side we can 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.540
 return our tastes 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.970
 the pins are always inside 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.860
 that's what will serve us as a benchmark 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.860
 to then go to sewing 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.000
 once the whole thing is sewn you can 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.920
 cut next to them 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.930
 sewing to be able to remove the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.310
 surplus of fabrics remains 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.079
 guides is finally or react 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.939
 Normally adapted to my size 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.560

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.079
 your calf thighs or knees you have 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.519
