dot you can looks in it as far as the
dot<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> even

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
dot if you want but just know that even

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.490 
dot if you want but just know that even
the<00:02:02.130> short<00:02:02.399> lines<00:02:02.640> she's<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.659> invisibly

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the short lines she's kind of invisibly

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.119 
the short lines she's kind of invisibly
connect<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> green<00:02:05.579> dot<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
connect to the green dot up here and you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.990 
connect to the green dot up here and you
also<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.209> one

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
also don't have to have this one

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500 
also don't have to have this one
point<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.130> two<00:02:13.520> or<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.270> put<00:02:14.420> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
point you can have two or you can put it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.720 
point you can have two or you can put it
on<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.750> side<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.770> I've<00:02:19.460> also

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
on the side like this one so I've also

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.720 
on the side like this one so I've also
marked<00:02:20.120> where<00:02:20.570> if<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.080> turn<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.040> head<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
marked where if you turn the head the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.040 
marked where if you turn the head the
growth<00:02:23.000> point<00:02:23.330> also<00:02:23.810> turns<00:02:25.480> over<00:02:26.480> here<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
growth point also turns over here I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.230 
growth point also turns over here I
marked<00:02:27.560> where<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.010> could<00:02:28.190> possibly<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.970> a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
marked where you could possibly have a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.720 
marked where you could possibly have a
ponytail<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.830> ponytail<00:02:31.160> your<00:02:31.520> head

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
ponytail like the ponytail your head

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.270 
ponytail like the ponytail your head
hair<00:02:32.150> would<00:02:32.330> be<00:02:32.360> gathered<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.560> it'll<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:34.040> this

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
hair would be gathered so it'll be this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.100 
hair would be gathered so it'll be this
kind<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> growth<00:02:35.209> point<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.630> sorts

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
kind of like a growth point of sorts

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.320 
kind of like a growth point of sorts
so<00:02:36.530> here's<00:02:36.740> from<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.980> side<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.580> here's<00:02:38.240> from

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
so here's from the side and here's from

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.370 
so here's from the side and here's from
the<00:02:38.480> back<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.550> also<00:02:40.700> do<00:02:41.300> like<00:02:42.020> fun

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the back and you can also do like fun

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.860 
the back and you can also do like fun
things<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.950> we'll<00:02:43.100> try<00:02:43.489> like<00:02:43.730> out<00:02:44.209> different

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
things and we'll try like out different

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.050 
things and we'll try like out different
kind<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.170> points<00:02:46.010> if<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.250> want<00:02:46.459> like<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.880> did

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
kind of points if you want like I did

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.780 
kind of points if you want like I did
here<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:47.989> all<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:49.340> these<00:02:49.489> lines

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
here and then all of these lines

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.090 
here and then all of these lines
converge<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.360> dot<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.500> side<00:02:51.739> this

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
converge to that dot on this side this

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.140 
converge to that dot on this side this
dot<00:02:53.950> okay<00:02:54.980> now<00:02:55.250> I'll<00:02:55.400> actually<00:02:55.610> go<00:02:55.970> into

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
dot okay now I'll actually go into

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.570 
dot okay now I'll actually go into
drawing<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.810> bangs<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.410> usually<00:02:58.280> don't<00:02:58.370> do

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
drawing the bangs I usually don't do

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.370 
drawing the bangs I usually don't do
this<00:02:58.640> but<00:02:58.820> for<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.390> sake<00:02:59.570> of<00:02:59.600> this<00:02:59.780> tutorial

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
this but for the sake of this tutorial

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.229 
this but for the sake of this tutorial
I'll<00:03:00.560> draw<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.880> hair<00:03:02.120> line<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:04.239> there's

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
I'll draw in the hair line and there's

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.420 
I'll draw in the hair line and there's
no<00:03:05.390> one<00:03:05.750> way<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:05.959> draw<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.530> hair<00:03:06.890> line<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:07.370> is

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
no one way to draw the hair line this is

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.150 
no one way to draw the hair line this is
just<00:03:07.640> like<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> simplified<00:03:08.540> version<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:09.160> guess

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
just like a simplified version I guess

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.460 
just like a simplified version I guess
and<00:03:10.459> if<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:10.970> put<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.239> higher<00:03:11.450> you'll<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.140> a

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
and if you put it higher you'll have a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.220 
and if you put it higher you'll have a
larger<00:03:13.220> forehead<00:03:13.640> put<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.420> lower<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.959> have<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
larger forehead put it lower you have a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.910 
larger forehead put it lower you have a
smaller<00:03:15.560> forehead<00:03:16.750> okay<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.350> there's<00:03:18.650> my

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
smaller forehead okay so there's my

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.460 
smaller forehead okay so there's my
rough<00:03:19.190> hair<00:03:19.430> line<00:03:19.720> I'm<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.959> draw<00:03:21.170> my

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
rough hair line I'm going to draw my

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.150 
rough hair line I'm going to draw my
growth<00:03:21.799> point<00:03:23.410> here<00:03:26.590> okay<00:03:27.590> now<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:27.830> start

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
growth point here okay now I start

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.729 
growth point here okay now I start
drawing<00:03:28.400> bangs<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.840> usually<00:03:30.320> start<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.680> the

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
drawing bangs I usually start in the

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.680 
drawing bangs I usually start in the
center<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.230> kind<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.350> Tim<00:03:34.209> draw<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:35.480> big

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
center so I kind of Tim draw one big

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.930 
center so I kind of Tim draw one big
line<00:03:35.870> down<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.230> center<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.640> start

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
line down the center and I start

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.420 
line down the center and I start
clumping<00:03:38.239> my<00:03:38.600> hair<00:03:38.900> into<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.350> general<00:03:39.769> M<00:03:39.980> shape

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
clumping my hair into a general M shape

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.490 
clumping my hair into a general M shape
or<00:03:41.030> I'll<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.269> big<00:03:41.630> clump<00:03:41.900> in<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.200> center

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
or I'll have a big clump in the center

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.750 
or I'll have a big clump in the center
and<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.790> kind<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.150> smaller<00:03:44.450> clump<00:03:44.750> on<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.959> side

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
and to kind of smaller clump on the side

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.229 
and to kind of smaller clump on the side
I<00:03:47.290> also<00:03:48.290> put<00:03:48.709> hair<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.010> between<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.850> clumps

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
I also put hair in between the clumps

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.680 
I also put hair in between the clumps
this<00:03:50.630> would<00:03:50.810> make<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.019> look<00:03:51.110> natural<00:03:52.690> clumping

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
this would make it look natural clumping

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.630 
this would make it look natural clumping
the<00:03:53.870> hair<00:03:54.110> makes<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.980> little<00:03:55.220> bit<00:03:55.400> more

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
the hair makes it a little bit more

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.819 
the hair makes it a little bit more
organized<00:03:56.269> where<00:03:57.019> if<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.230> have<00:03:57.380> lots<00:03:57.680> and

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
organized where if you have lots and

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.370 
organized where if you have lots and
lots<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.250> tiny<00:03:58.519> stringy<00:03:59.090> hairs<00:03:59.420> come<00:04:00.200> looks

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
lots of tiny stringy hairs come looks

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.080 
lots of tiny stringy hairs come looks
like<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.530> mess<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.070> really<00:04:01.280> jumbled<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.790> messy

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
like a mess and really jumbled the messy

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.210 
like a mess and really jumbled the messy
but<00:04:02.900> if<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.019> put<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.320> clumps<00:04:03.680> even<00:04:04.070> though

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
but if you put the clumps even though

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.280 
but if you put the clumps even though
you<00:04:04.280> have<00:04:04.640> thin<00:04:05.090> lines<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.720> looks<00:04:05.989> kind<00:04:06.200> of

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
you have thin lines it looks kind of
