ice<00:03:08.590> cream<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.070> recipe<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.910> think<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
ice cream in this recipe I just think it

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.850 
ice cream in this recipe I just think it
goes<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.570> well<00:03:10.600> with<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.959> flavor<00:03:11.230> combination

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
goes so well with the flavor combination

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.009 
goes so well with the flavor combination
of<00:03:11.980> caramel<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.550> chocolate<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.000> fruit<00:03:13.360> so

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
of caramel and chocolate and fruit so

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.870 
of caramel and chocolate and fruit so
take<00:03:14.230> one<00:03:14.260> perfect<00:03:15.040> scoop<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.459> vanilla<00:03:15.519> ice
