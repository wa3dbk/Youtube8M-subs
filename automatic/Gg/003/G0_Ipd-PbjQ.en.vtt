00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
put four on the door I tried it without

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.130 
put four on the door I tried it without
the<00:01:14.450> Alpine<00:01:14.869> KTP<00:01:16.210> for<00:01:17.210> four<00:01:17.420> or<00:01:17.479> five<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.869> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.959 
the Alpine KTP for four or five you and
it<00:01:18.469> didn't<00:01:18.770> work<00:01:18.890> out<00:01:19.039> fine<00:01:19.399> because<00:01:19.640> it

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
it didn't work out fine because it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:44.830 
it didn't work out fine because it
doesn't<00:01:20.630> sound<00:01:20.780> good<00:01:38.229> but<00:01:40.149> everything<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.780> I

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840
