time<00:02:50.099> for<00:02:50.130> me<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:52.049> know<00:02:52.079> I<00:02:52.200> do<00:02:52.380> find<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
time for me I you know I do find it a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.890 
time for me I you know I do find it a
bit<00:02:53.099> hard<00:02:53.489> having<00:02:53.910> three<00:02:54.209> watches<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.870> i

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
bit hard having three watches out i

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.110 
bit hard having three watches out i
think<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> perfect<00:02:55.920> number<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.849> is

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
to two watches so I'm thinking maybe the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.100 
to two watches so I'm thinking maybe the
