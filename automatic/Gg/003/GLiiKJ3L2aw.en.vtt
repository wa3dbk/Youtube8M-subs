00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 colonial salami as an aperitif is a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.330
 true delight is not really 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.910
 now you imagine using it as 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 ingredient of a salty pie is this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.250
 recipe that we came to learn from 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.930
 mass marjoram to start will not flour 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.510
 It's a different recipe that you use in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.970
 place of flour and rice leftovers 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 rice that we keep varying for the week 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 the weekend is already saved in 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 the refrigerator you end up using instead of the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.980
 then write down the ingredients for 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 mass you will use five eggs 4 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 tablespoons two tablespoons lard 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 of bacon stock a cup and a half 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 milk 3 cups cooked rice and two 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.000
 Coffee spoons of baking powder 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 for the filling separate a pound of salami 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.800
 smoked colonial four large tomatoes 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.339
 two medium onions chopped 200 grams 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 of colonial cheese and parsley August the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.119
 What do I do at a pace? 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 We already talked well on the little thing in 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.280
 very small pieces and place close 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.300
 big time to cut pie is not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.740
 good 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.630
 Place the chopped tomato is well 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.970
 optional you can not put both 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.300
 parsley as chives 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.570
 But I like the positive with the little baby. 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.970
 One more thing is that there are people going 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:44.660
 get more off and onion finely chopped 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:46.040
 Mix it up again, I 'll finish it. 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.509
 the filling 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.100
 I'm going to put a colonial cheese 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.160
 Who does not like a salon with cheese, right? 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.670
 so the two together in the pie stays very 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.670
 tasty 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.570
 I finished the stuffing well, right? 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:18.280
 stir before hitting the blender 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.280
 the games in five games 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.459
 now I'm going to take a shower and put the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.360
 four colleagues of bath nor slow 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.840
 Then I put the two broth tablets 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.840
 of bacon 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.070
 now I'll put the milk 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.630
 had a bit of ingredient 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.250
 it was mixed 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 Now I put the voice in a few, but it 's 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.730
 cooked rice gradually puts new 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.130
 to finish mass I put the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.130
 yeast 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.170
 I finished the dough well and I put 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 I will not put it in the way I'll put it on 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:25.329
 but this stuffing is ready now 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.000
 is well- mixed dough is mixed and 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.000
 You get there, you go to the already crowded way. 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.329
 goes to the pre-psychic oven to 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.829
 temperature in the 250 years how long 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.659
 there are 50 thousand 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.659
 the relationship is good 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.579
 Good how we see a recipe well 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.220
 simple even easy quick to do 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.260
 mass and gives a lot of people studied 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.909
 a big family does not give a snack 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.909
 12 15 people quietly
