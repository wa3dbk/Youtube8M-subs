00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.430
 bein is currently one of the 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.769
 most popular characters in the code 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.410
 There are many bits for her 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.179
 etcetera critical attack speed 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.980
 in the next video we will learn 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.440
 what objects we have to buy to carry 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.330
 the damage of bail to the maximum in terms of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.160
 the assumptions we are going to study which 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.320
 are the first two items best for 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.720
 dance at level 14 facing a 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.400
 1800 current life goal since 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.720
 this is the average life of the objectives 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.599
 that stick to beige during inks 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.099
 around the minute 28 we will imagine a 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.930
 hypothetical case that once in this 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.300
 auto attacking for 100 seconds to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.559
 minimize the rounding error 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.660
 we will explore the water damage as it is 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.129
 an empowered and light basic and the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.890
 we will focus exclusively on 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 basic and the w all assumptions not 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.310
 they affect the original problem 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 let's examine the damage of the items 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.660
 spectral dancer of the stalin filo 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.570
 infinity and leaf of the ruined king in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.370
 all possible combinations 2 to 2 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 first of all let's define a type 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 of different area this type of bird 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.650
 includes the critic and is simply a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 weighting in probabilities with the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.810
 critical for example if we had 100 of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.610
 bird and a 20% critical 80 percent 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 of the times we will make 100 of the year and the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.320
 another 20 we will do 200 translated into 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.090
 weights the new to 20 would be 100 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.250
 by 0.8 plus 200 by 0.2 equal to 120 a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 pod at level 14 has 93 of ago by 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 known defect is today as yesterday the area 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.060
 real we have the following items 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 a of true in this case over that of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.130
 The highest is the one that includes the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.750
 king 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.850
 I differ infinitely because we remember that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.649
 we squeeze an 1800's enemy of life 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.509
 and the passive of the king's blade makes him 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.540
 enough damage in terms of speed 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.090
 of attack by ni at level 14 you will have 0.97 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.750
 in 64 and each item will provide you with 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.750
 following values 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.160
 we will proceed then to see the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.630
 different dancer combinations more 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.270
 static 139.5 true day of 1.56 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 8 attack speed this allows 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 20 one hundred and fifty six attacks 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.500
 basic and 52 sub stable more dancer 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.630
 edge for 315 725 of a of true 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.860
 1305 attack speed 130 attacks 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.130
 and 40 and www dancer plus leaf is 340 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.040
 points 6 days of true 1,568 of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.450
 attack speed 156 basic and 52 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.510
 remaining stapes edge of 289 point 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.530
 775 of a of true 1,239 of speed 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.989
 of attack 123 basic and 41 double vves 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.709
 this same soy the 300 bird 14.4 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.010
 true 1,502 attack speed 150 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.310
 basic and 50 euros double 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.670
 if the most leaf at 470 point 25 day of 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.950
 true 1,239 attack speed 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.950
 123 basic and 41 double vouchers 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.930
 taking into account these values and that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 the state will approximately give about 10 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.459
 charges per basic we will have the following 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.290
 total damage table this table says that 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.060
 the edge + blade combination is the one that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.550
 damage provides followed closely by 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.739
 dance and more sheet the problem is the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.510
 cost of gold edge plus blade costs 1000 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.730
 more gold with what to be carving 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.440
 total of both very close deserve more 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.720
 it's worth buying the king's blade first 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.360
 and then dance and it's ventral if after 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.310
 we just spent 875 to buy a 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.940
 peak we would do more damage than with the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.460
 filo combination more ok 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.170
 summarizing the red combination of the king 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.970
 more spectral dancer is the most optimal 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.490
 for bein as far as damage is concerned 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.440
 this time he will do more damage he endured his life 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.090
 current has the objective and will give little 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.200
 damage in the game but will provide the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.300
 sustenance necessary to endure 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.140
 passively online until you have the sheet 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.140
 of the king completed 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.340
