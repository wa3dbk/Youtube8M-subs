you definitely don't want to flip the
unit<00:02:35.450> backwards<00:02:36.079> because<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.189> doesn't<00:02:37.549> have

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
the front one comb in the back which I

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.960 
the front one comb in the back which I
do<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.650> place<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.639> has<00:02:46.819> adjustable

straps I find that this unit fits my
head<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.389> snug<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.560> only<00:02:51.980> use<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.549> comb

in<00:02:52.939> the<00:02:53.060> back<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.540> don't<00:02:53.870> have<00:02:54.049> any<00:02:54.319> combs<00:02:54.650> in

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
in the back I don't have any combs in

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.220 
in the back I don't have any combs in
the<00:02:55.040> front<00:02:55.340> end<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:55.849> sometimes<00:02:56.389> those<00:02:56.870> do

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the front end and sometimes those do

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.860 
the front end and sometimes those do
pull<00:02:57.919> my<00:02:58.189> hair<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.579> little<00:02:58.879> bit<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.389> I<00:02:59.419> try<00:02:59.689> not

to<00:02:59.930> use<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.470> combs<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.069> front<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.970> hair

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
to use the combs in the front this hair

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.179 
to use the combs in the front this hair
feels<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:03.109> nice<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.680> touch<00:03:03.709> it's

this<00:03:12.500> unit<00:03:12.889> I<00:03:13.069> think<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.549> it's<00:03:13.700> perfect<00:03:14.150> for

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
this unit I think that it's perfect for

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.000 
this unit I think that it's perfect for
summertime<00:03:14.599> it's<00:03:14.989> very<00:03:15.199> short

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
summertime it's very short

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.219 
summertime it's very short
so<00:03:16.400> you're<00:03:16.940> not<00:03:17.150> going<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.419> really<00:03:17.690> sweat<00:03:17.989> all

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:18.229 
so you're not going to really sweat all

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.800 
so you're not going to really sweat all
that<00:03:18.500> much<00:03:18.739> with<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.760> not<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> thin<00:03:20.479> unit

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
that much with it it's not a thin unit

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.559 
that much with it it's not a thin unit
but<00:03:21.019> it's<00:03:21.139> also<00:03:21.379> not<00:03:21.889> very<00:03:21.949> thick<00:03:22.579> so<00:03:23.150> if<00:03:23.419> you

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
but it's also not very thick so if you

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.110 
but it's also not very thick so if you
guys<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:24.109> a<00:03:24.139> more<00:03:24.409> natural<00:03:25.069> looking<00:03:25.459> unit<00:03:25.909> I

great<00:03:28.549> for<00:03:28.879> protective<00:03:29.419> styling<00:03:29.959> if<00:03:30.169> you<00:03:30.379> have

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
great for protective styling if you have

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.670 
I think that's the key to keeping your
hair<00:03:37.099> healthy<00:03:37.609> is<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:38.239> have<00:03:38.419> low<00:03:38.780> nipple<00:03:39.349> ation

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
hair healthy is to have low nipple ation

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.939 
hair healthy is to have low nipple ation
styles<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.669> wearing<00:03:41.419> wigs<00:03:41.690> definitely<00:03:42.470> helps

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
styles and wearing wigs definitely helps

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.509 
styles and wearing wigs definitely helps
