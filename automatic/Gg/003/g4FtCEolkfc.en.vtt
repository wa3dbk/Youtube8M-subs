now the brig is incapacitated so we can
board<00:02:56.570> him<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.960> we<00:02:57.200> choose<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:58.520> since<00:02:58.760> we

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
board him if we choose to but since we

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.640 
board him if we choose to but since we
still<00:02:59.120> have<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> tower<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.720> deal<00:02:59.870> with<00:03:00.110> we'll

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
still have a tower to deal with we'll

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.200 
still have a tower to deal with we'll
take<00:03:00.800> them<00:03:00.980> down<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.430> go<00:03:01.580> finish<00:03:01.880> off<00:03:02.030> this

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
take them down and go finish off this

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.820 
take them down and go finish off this

even<00:03:08.550> though<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.030> can<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.300> port<00:03:09.600> these<00:03:09.960> towers

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
even though we can the port these towers

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.290 
even though we can the port these towers
still<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.890> lot<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.220> damage<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.000> we<00:03:12.120> still

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
still do a lot of damage so we still

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:27.100 
still do a lot of damage so we still
have<00:03:12.360> two<00:03:12.570> braids<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.020> defend<00:03:13.290> ourselves
