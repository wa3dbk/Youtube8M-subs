00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
associate thoughts with that but we're

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.209

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200

the cursor doesn't do what I want it to

the cursor doesn't do what I want it to

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
do but it's just a matter of trying

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.490 
do but it's just a matter of trying
again<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.729> eventually<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.899> works<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.380> it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
again and eventually it works so it's

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.249 
again and eventually it works so it's
less<00:01:56.979> reliable<00:01:57.429> than<00:01:57.729> moving<00:01:58.420> my<00:01:58.689> arm<00:01:58.869> which<00:01:59.110> I
