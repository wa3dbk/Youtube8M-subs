00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.029
 in our jargon not only of students but 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.260
 also of the whole school community 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.349
 we see these buildings as a 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.089
 chicken coop in the true sense of the word 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.589
 chicken coop they call each other one 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.509
 definition that leaves little space 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.670
 to the imagination should 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.180
 attend it in up to 500 students 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.280
 instead there are more than 800 in 33 classes 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.350
 this is the situation in which they find themselves 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.270
 in the branch in via montello del 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.190
 high school duke of the abruzzes 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.470
 we are 30 and we are all 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.850
 crushed with desks for example us 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.410
 we are 31 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 and also the fact that there are too many people 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.339
 in the class it can cause problems either 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 in education that dries out in the mind 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.710
 legambiente the classific mo that loses 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.510
 attention maybe they can so then 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.769
 now we enter to see concretely 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.319
 what are the problems 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.510
 right now we will open the doors of the 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.479
 our school if we want to define it this way 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.879
 we even go to Treviso people 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.699
 of classes of just 20 square meters 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.219
 with 15 banks as you can see these 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.170
 are the conditions in which the boys 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:10.170
 we study about this school we have about 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 3 4 square meters per student when 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 instead there are other school realities 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.110
 who even have five times as much 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.719
 other larger ones come to have them 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 also this class also 31 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.950
 also acts as a locker room since 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.899
 men's locker rooms are missing we are 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.460
 force yourself to change us in here 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.770
 for talks with parents have 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.289
 proceeds of the separates along the corridor 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.140
 overall there are laboratories outside 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.329
 standard and inadequate bathrooms 6 Turkish for i 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.310
 males and a dozen for women are 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.009
 long and expectations for needs and needs 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.140
 file during recreation 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.329
 interminable then where 800 students 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.820
 they come to do their needs 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.859
 the province had marked this site 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.929
 to give a temporary solution in 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.060
 waiting for new accommodation 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.250
 in the last three years the institute has 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.380
 rejected 60 entries because not 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.299
 we really have the space to host them 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.219
 therefore local institutions must 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.439
 really understand that this is a problem 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.369
 very serious structural that is going 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.369
 for too long
