bow<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> arrow<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.910> much<00:00:36.360> much<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:36.809> reliable

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
bow and arrow is much much more reliable

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
bow and arrow is much much more reliable
and<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.100> can't<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.820> much<00:00:39.030> quicker<00:00:39.300> for

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and it can't it was much quicker for

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
and it can't it was much quicker for
them<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.899> reload<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.920> were<00:00:40.980> super

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
them to reload with this they were super

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
them to reload with this they were super
super<00:00:42.000> effective<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.110> want<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> bring

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
super effective and so we want to bring

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.869 
super effective and so we want to bring

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
uniqueness comes in the form that has

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.380 
uniqueness comes in the form that has
much<00:00:51.989> less<00:00:52.230> arc<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> better<00:00:53.670> control<00:00:54.239> at

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
much less arc and better control at

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
much less arc and better control at
long-range<00:00:54.600> accuracy<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.739> those<00:00:56.550> also

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
long-range accuracy but then those also

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
long-range accuracy but then those also
took<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.300> time<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.629> reload<00:00:57.960> foot<00:00:58.680> looks<00:00:58.949> are

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.670 
took more time to reload foot looks are
very<00:00:59.309> unique<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.050> inaccurate

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
very unique and kind of inaccurate

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.299 
very unique and kind of inaccurate
they're<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.760> unreliable<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.070> when<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> hit

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
they're very unreliable and when you hit

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.640 
they're very unreliable and when you hit
somebody<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.820> almost<00:01:06.030> feel<00:01:06.450> like

opponent<00:01:14.400> Gears<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> War<00:01:15.060> 3<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.840> had<00:01:15.960> this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
opponent Gears of War 3 they had this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.719 
opponent Gears of War 3 they had this
really<00:01:16.350> awesome<00:01:16.530> system<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.250> active

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
really awesome system that's active

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.240 
really awesome system that's active
reload<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.360> we've<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.380> done<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.830> for

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
reload and we've actually done that for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
reload and we've actually done that for
all<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.520> our<00:01:20.610> ranged<00:01:20.939> weapons<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.420> well<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
all of our ranged weapons as well and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
all of our ranged weapons as well and
each<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.830> unique<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> weapon<00:01:23.850> type

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
each one is unique to that weapon type

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
each one is unique to that weapon type
so<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> makes<00:01:25.320> sense<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so you know it makes sense to that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.300 
so you know it makes sense to that
weapon<00:01:26.369> how<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> could<00:01:27.390> improve<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.530> shaved<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
weapon how you could improve or shaved a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
weapon how you could improve or shaved a
you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.119> small<00:01:30.600> amount<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.200> off<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you know a small amount of time off of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
you know a small amount of time off of
your<00:01:31.740> reload<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.729> fraction<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
your reload and that fraction of a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.300 
your reload and that fraction of a
second<00:01:33.840> could<00:01:33.990> mean<00:01:34.409> life<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.650> death<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
second could mean life or death just

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
second could mean life or death just
like<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.640> did<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
like it did back then and we have a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
like it did back then and we have a
squad<00:01:37.590> system<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.250> squat<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.700> with

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
squad system so you can squat up with

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:39.800 
squad system so you can squat up with
some<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.180> friends<00:01:39.390> you're<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> be

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.920 
to have really smart static spawn
placements<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.189> pick<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.880> archer<00:01:48.360> when

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
placements so if you pick an archer when

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.929 
placements so if you pick an archer when

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you select where you want to spawn on

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.260 
you select where you want to spawn on
the<00:01:51.720> map<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.770> first<00:01:53.040> options<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:54.030> where

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the map it the first options or where

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.569 
the map it the first options or where
we're<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> try<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.840> put<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.229> first<00:01:56.159> so

systems that we think of ahead of time
that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
