moments<00:00:02.639> in<00:00:03.090> which<00:00:03.149> we<00:00:03.570> know<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.140> malicious

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
moments in which we know of malicious

know of malicious features now some of

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.440 
know of malicious features now some of
them<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.860> malicious<00:00:11.490> features<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.150> others

them have malicious features and others

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.910 
them have malicious features and others
don't<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:13.610> we<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.820> never<00:00:15.059> identity<00:00:15.929> identify

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
don't but we can never identity identify

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
but I'm sure there are some so what can

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.999 
but I'm sure there are some so what can
we<00:00:28.650> say<00:00:28.980> about<00:00:29.630> without<00:00:30.830> knowing<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we say about without knowing the

software are human too we also make

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
mistakes the code of our programs also

mistakes the code of our programs also
has<00:01:13.920> errors<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> find<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.049> error<00:01:16.259> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
don't like you are free to change it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.160 
don't like you are free to change it
we<00:01:24.360> can't<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.990> perfect<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.550> can<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.690> do

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
we can't be perfect if we can how we do

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.290 
we can't be perfect if we can how we do
respect<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.340> you

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.950 

thus<00:01:35.930> freedom<00:01:36.710> one<00:01:37.040> is<00:01:37.490> essential<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:38.780> it's

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
thus freedom one is essential but it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.680 
thus freedom one is essential but it's
not<00:01:39.170> enough<00:01:39.460> because<00:01:40.460> that's<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.210> freedoms

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
not enough because that's the freedoms

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.670 
not enough because that's the freedoms
of<00:01:41.750> personally<00:01:42.440> studying<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.100> change<00:01:44.680> dislike

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
of personally studying a change dislike

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.190 
of personally studying a change dislike
go<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.160> program<00:01:46.670> that's<00:01:47.510> not<00:01:47.840> enough

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
go to the program that's not enough

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.320 
go to the program that's not enough
because<00:01:48.980> there<00:01:49.190> are<00:01:49.340> millions<00:01:49.760> of<00:01:49.910> users<00:01:50.120> that

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
because there are millions of users that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.050 
because there are millions of users that
don't<00:01:50.870> know<00:01:51.050> how<00:01:51.230> to<00:01:51.290> program<00:01:51.800> they<00:01:52.640> can't

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
don't know how to program they can't

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.280 
don't know how to program they can't
personally<00:01:53.750> exercise<00:01:54.410> 3<00:01:54.830> 2<00:01:54.950> 1<00:01:55.720> but<00:01:56.720> even<00:01:56.930> for<00:01:57.230> a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
personally exercise 3 2 1 but even for a

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.560 
personally exercise 3 2 1 but even for a
programmer<00:01:57.770> like<00:01:58.100> me<00:01:58.310> freedom<00:01:58.730> one<00:01:59.150> is<00:01:59.360> not

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
programmer like me freedom one is not

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.350 
programmer like me freedom one is not
enough<00:01:59.980> because<00:02:00.980> there's<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:01.700> too<00:02:02.150> much

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
enough because there's just too much

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.660 
enough because there's just too much
software<00:02:02.870> in<00:02:03.800> fact<00:02:05.950> there's<00:02:06.950> too<00:02:07.190> much<00:02:07.340> free

somebody else takes that and makes

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.580 
somebody else takes that and makes
another<00:02:51.940> change<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.600> coastal<00:02:52.960> river<00:02:53.200> in<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.690 
direction and releases use modified
version<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.710> someone<00:02:57.040> else<00:02:57.160> starts<00:02:57.550> with

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
version and someone else starts with

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970 
version and someone else starts with
that<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.090> makes<00:02:58.240> another<00:02:58.600> change<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.350> reduces

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that it makes another change and reduces

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.090 
that it makes another change and reduces
his<00:03:00.160> modified<00:03:00.730> version<00:03:01.680> afterwards<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.950> will

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
his modified version afterwards we will

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.330 
his modified version afterwards we will
say<00:03:03.400> they<00:03:04.300> will<00:03:04.720> work<00:03:05.140> together<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.950> produce

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
say they will work together to produce

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.550 
say they will work together to produce
the<00:03:07.330> feature<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:08.020> we<00:03:08.200> hold<00:03:08.380> dear<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.740> God

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the feature that we hold dear to God

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.380 
the feature that we hold dear to God
which<00:03:11.560> doesn't<00:03:12.040> mean<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.400> they<00:03:12.580> planted<00:03:13.240> in

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
which doesn't mean that they planted in

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.140 
which doesn't mean that they planted in
advance<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.200> way<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:15.010> first<00:03:15.340> one<00:03:15.730> may<00:03:16.030> have

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
advance that way the first one may have

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.020 
advance that way the first one may have
had<00:03:16.360> no<00:03:16.630> plans<00:03:17.020> beyond<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.190> feature<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.790> she

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
had no plans beyond the feature that she

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.950 
had no plans beyond the feature that she
personally<00:03:19.690> made<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:21.310> nonetheless<00:03:21.960> because

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
personally made but nonetheless because

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.110 
personally made but nonetheless because
the<00:03:23.200> program<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.650> agreed<00:03:24.160> they<00:03:24.340> were<00:03:24.400> able<00:03:24.790> to

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
the program is agreed they were able to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.950 
the program is agreed they were able to
cooperate

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.430
