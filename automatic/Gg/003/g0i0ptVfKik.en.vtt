one because of the background noise on
the<00:05:49.150> video<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.750> also<00:05:50.170> we've<00:05:50.410> got<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.650> fixed

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
the video and also we've got a fixed

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.370 
the video and also we've got a fixed
screen<00:05:51.760> there's<00:05:52.120> no<00:05:52.270> way<00:05:52.420> of<00:05:52.540> rotating<00:05:53.230> this

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.820 
screen there's no way of rotating this
screen<00:05:53.740> round<00:05:53.980> to<00:05:54.700> a<00:05:54.730> different<00:05:55.120> angle

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
screen round to a different angle

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.690 
screen round to a different angle
