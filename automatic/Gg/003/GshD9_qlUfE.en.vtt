that this these are my end of round

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.890 
that this these are my end of round
areas<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.890> see<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.689> end

areas and you can see here that the end
of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.170> stripe<00:01:31.530> doesn't<00:01:32.250> match<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850

beginning of the stripe and the reason

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
beginning of the stripe and the reason
for<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.570> knitting<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
for that is because knitting in the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
for that is because knitting in the
round<00:01:36.780> isn't<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.680> knitting<00:01:38.040> rounds<00:01:38.820> of

round isn't really knitting rounds of
knitting<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.420> stacked<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.020> top<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
knitting that are stacked up on top of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
knitting that are stacked up on top of
each<00:01:40.530> other<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.520> working<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.060> an

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
each other it's really working in an

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
each other it's really working in an
endless<00:01:42.420> spiral<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.530> while<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
endless spiral so while this is the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.639 
endless spiral so while this is the
beginning<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> round<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.509> while<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
beginning of the round here while this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.170 
beginning of the round here while this
stitch<00:01:47.040> maybe<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> beginning<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> round

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
stitch maybe the beginning of the round

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880 
stitch maybe the beginning of the round
and<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.689> stitch<00:01:48.990> maybe<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> end<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and this stitch maybe the end of the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.520 
and this stitch maybe the end of the
round<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> end<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> round<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.689> always<00:01:52.020> one

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
round the end of the round is always one

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
round the end of the round is always one
higher<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.310> you're<00:01:53.490> working<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
higher because you're working in a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
higher because you're working in a
spiral<00:01:54.390> around<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.110> around<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.470> around<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
spiral around and around and around so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.350 
spiral around and around and around so
you're<00:01:56.430> always<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.090> problem

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
you're always going to have a problem

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
you're always going to have a problem
whenever<00:01:57.960> you're<00:01:58.259> working<00:01:58.380> stripes<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
whenever you're working stripes in the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
whenever you're working stripes in the
round<00:01:59.159> where<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.310> don't<00:01:59.610> quite<00:02:00.119> meet<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.689> at

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
round where they don't quite meet up at

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.950 
round where they don't quite meet up at
the<00:02:00.899> edges<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:03.180> row<00:02:03.360> stripes<00:02:03.750> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the edges now with one row stripes this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.319 
the edges now with one row stripes this
is<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.439> obvious<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.520> larger<00:02:05.909> stripes<00:02:06.180> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
is very obvious with larger stripes it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
is very obvious with larger stripes it
can<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.600> less<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.960> an<00:02:07.049> issue<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.530> may<00:02:07.649> not

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
can be less of an issue and it may not

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
can be less of an issue and it may not
even<00:02:07.860> bother<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.520> much<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.539> this

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
even bother you that much to have this

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.029 
even bother you that much to have this
kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.020> thing<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.379> will<00:02:10.560> block<00:02:10.860> out

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
kind of thing this will block out

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.730 
kind of thing this will block out
somewhat<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.810> want<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.200> really

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
somewhat but if you want to have really

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
somewhat but if you want to have really
perfect<00:02:14.010> stripes<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.520> meet<00:02:14.850> perfectly

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
perfect stripes that meet perfectly

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.150 
perfect stripes that meet perfectly
together<00:02:15.570> at<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> ends<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.320> rounds<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.770> have

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
together at the ends of rounds and have

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160 
together at the ends of rounds and have
an<00:02:17.400> almost<00:02:17.760> seamless<00:02:17.970> look<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.570> them<00:02:18.720> there

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
an almost seamless look to them there

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.330 
an almost seamless look to them there
are<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.320> couple<00:02:19.530> different<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:20.160> cool

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
are a couple different really cool

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.640 
are a couple different really cool
techniques<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.090> use<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.990> I'll<00:02:22.320> show

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
techniques that you can use so I'll show

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.120 
techniques that you can use so I'll show
you<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.860> first<00:02:23.040> one<00:02:23.310> here<00:02:23.390> if<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.680> want<00:02:25.950> to

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you the first one here if you want to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.270 
you the first one here if you want to
work<00:02:26.370> stripes<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.210> more<00:02:27.480> than<00:02:27.660> one<00:02:28.280> stripes

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
work stripes of more than one stripes

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
work stripes of more than one stripes
where<00:02:29.490> each<00:02:29.700> color<00:02:30.060> or<00:02:30.630> each<00:02:30.780> stripe<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.320> more

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
where each color or each stripe is more

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.320 
where each color or each stripe is more
than<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.890> row<00:02:32.100> high<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.790> probably<00:02:33.150> your

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
than one row high this is probably your

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.010 
than one row high this is probably your
best<00:02:33.390> option<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.740> you've<00:02:35.130> got<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
best option so you've got here this is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020 
best option so you've got here this is
what's<00:02:37.230> known<00:02:37.380> as<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> slip<00:02:37.980> stitch<00:02:38.190> dogless

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
what's known as a slip stitch dogless

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.850 
what's known as a slip stitch dogless
join<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.860> see<00:02:41.070> here<00:02:41.490> that<00:02:42.710> here's<00:02:43.710> my

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
join so you can see here that here's my

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.180 
join so you can see here that here's my
end<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> round<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:45.200> there's<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.620> barely

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
end of the round and there's just barely

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.520 
end of the round and there's just barely
a<00:02:47.640> noticeable<00:02:48.480> jog<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.140> will<00:02:49.350> almost

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
a noticeable jog and this will almost

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.260 
a noticeable jog and this will almost
completely<00:02:50.160> block<00:02:50.400> out<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> point<00:02:51.030> where

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
completely block out to the point where

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.510 
completely block out to the point where
it's<00:02:51.510> almost<00:02:51.690> unnoticeable<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.340> look

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
it's almost unnoticeable now if you look

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.460 
it's almost unnoticeable now if you look
even<00:02:53.820> more<00:02:53.850> closely<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.170> while

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
even more closely you can see that while

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.320 
even more closely you can see that while
my<00:02:55.620> stripes<00:02:56.070> are<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.610> three<00:02:56.910> rows<00:02:57.090> high

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
my stripes are really three rows high

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.630 
my stripes are really three rows high
you've<00:02:57.750> got<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.110> two<00:02:58.440> three<00:02:58.470> stitches<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.370> any

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you've got one two three stitches in any

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.630 
you've got one two three stitches in any
given<00:02:59.970> stripe<00:03:00.210> one<00:03:00.480> two<00:03:00.750> three<00:03:01.080> stitches

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
given stripe one two three stitches

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.370 
given stripe one two three stitches
right<00:03:02.640> here<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.390> first<00:03:03.720> stitch<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.350> round

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
right here the first stitch of my round

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.990 
right here the first stitch of my round
the<00:03:04.770> first<00:03:04.950> stitch<00:03:05.250> after<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.640> end<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the first stitch after the end of the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.270 
the first stitch after the end of the
round<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.600> are<00:03:06.720> only<00:03:06.930> two<00:03:07.320> stitches<00:03:07.590> one

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
round there are only two stitches one

round there are only two stitches one
and<00:03:08.550> two<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.780> bottom<00:03:10.200> stitch<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.680> really

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
and two and this bottom stitch is really

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.210 
and two and this bottom stitch is really
pulled<00:03:11.340> up<00:03:11.610> quite<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> lot<00:03:12.890> what<00:03:13.890> happened

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
pulled up quite a lot what happened

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.650 
pulled up quite a lot what happened
there<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:14.760> slip<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.420> stitch

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
there is that we just slip that stitch

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.380 
there is that we just slip that stitch
it<00:03:16.050> pulls<00:03:16.710> up<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.280> what<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.760> does<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.120> pull

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390

that<00:05:11.300> entire<00:05:11.569> column<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:12.110> stitches<00:05:12.289> and

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
that entire column of stitches and

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.459 
that entire column of stitches and
evening<00:05:13.009> out<00:05:13.159> the<00:05:13.310> joins<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.930> this<00:05:15.080> is<00:05:15.229> a<00:05:15.259> good

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
evening out the joins so this is a good

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.680 
evening out the joins so this is a good
technique<00:05:15.650> for<00:05:16.039> when<00:05:16.219> you<00:05:16.400> want<00:05:17.240> stitches

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
technique for when you want stitches

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.300 
technique for when you want stitches
that<00:05:17.870> are<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.020> little<00:05:18.199> bit<00:05:18.409> thicker<00:05:18.680> what<00:05:19.219> it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
that are a little bit thicker what it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.159 
that are a little bit thicker what it
does<00:05:19.490> do<00:05:19.699> is<00:05:19.819> shorten<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.300> fabric<00:05:20.690> along<00:05:20.930> that

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
does do is shorten the fabric along that

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.480 
does do is shorten the fabric along that
line<00:05:21.409> of<00:05:21.590> course<00:05:21.800> because<00:05:22.129> there<00:05:22.250> are<00:05:22.340> just

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
line of course because there are just

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.369 
line of course because there are just
fewer<00:05:22.729> stitches<00:05:23.060> so<00:05:23.750> there<00:05:23.960> may<00:05:24.080> be<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.229> little

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
fewer stitches so there may be a little

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.830 
fewer stitches so there may be a little
bit<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.650> pulling<00:05:25.090> one<00:05:26.090> other<00:05:26.270> really<00:05:26.659> cool

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
bit of pulling one other really cool

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.119 
bit of pulling one other really cool
technique<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:27.379> you<00:05:27.469> can<00:05:27.500> use<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:28.099> just

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
technique that you can use is just

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.459 
technique that you can use is just
called<00:05:28.490> barber<00:05:28.909> pole<00:05:29.150> knitting<00:05:29.479> and<00:05:29.629> this<00:05:30.229> is

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
called barber pole knitting and this is

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.070 
called barber pole knitting and this is
really<00:05:30.770> simple<00:05:31.069> it's<00:05:31.490> kind<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.240> different

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
really simple it's kind of different

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.709 
really simple it's kind of different
here<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.319> don't<00:05:33.919> have<00:05:34.069> a<00:05:34.099> join<00:05:34.400> because<00:05:34.729> there

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
here you don't have a join because there

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.290 
here you don't have a join because there
is<00:05:35.990> no<00:05:36.560> place<00:05:36.860> where<00:05:37.129> a<00:05:37.190> stripe<00:05:37.610> meets<00:05:37.879> itself

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
is no place where a stripe meets itself

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.309 
is no place where a stripe meets itself
that<00:05:38.690> makes<00:05:38.870> sense

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
that makes sense

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.990 
that makes sense
think<00:05:39.919> of<00:05:40.039> the<00:05:40.159> stripes<00:05:40.430> as<00:05:40.639> though<00:05:40.789> they're

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
think of the stripes as though they're

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.820 
think of the stripes as though they're
stacked<00:05:41.330> up<00:05:41.539> as<00:05:41.750> though<00:05:42.020> they're<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.469> colors

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
stacked up as though they're the colors

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.409 
stacked up as though they're the colors
stacked<00:05:43.129> up<00:05:43.310> on<00:05:43.400> an<00:05:43.550> old-fashioned<00:05:44.089> barber

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
stacked up on an old-fashioned barber

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.700 
stacked up on an old-fashioned barber
pole<00:05:44.629> they're<00:05:44.810> just<00:05:44.960> kind<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.199> chasing<00:05:45.469> each

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
pole they're just kind of chasing each

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.390 
pole they're just kind of chasing each
other<00:05:45.889> around<00:05:46.060> they<00:05:47.060> never<00:05:47.330> meet<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.289> you<00:05:49.250> can

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
other around they never meet so you can

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.610 
other around they never meet so you can
see<00:05:49.610> here<00:05:49.909> that<00:05:50.029> the<00:05:50.389> pink<00:05:50.659> stripe<00:05:51.020> starts

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
see here that the pink stripe starts

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.390 
see here that the pink stripe starts
here<00:05:54.279> and<00:05:55.279> then<00:05:55.430> continues<00:05:56.029> and<00:05:57.400> then

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
here and then continues and then

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.550 
here and then continues and then
continues<00:05:58.969> and<00:05:59.210> just<00:05:59.389> keeps<00:05:59.599> going<00:05:59.719> up<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.379> up

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
continues and just keeps going up and up

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.800 
continues and just keeps going up and up
and<00:06:00.740> up<00:06:00.919> all<00:06:01.190> the<00:06:01.339> way<00:06:01.430> around<00:06:01.699> the<00:06:01.789> fabric<00:06:02.210> so

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
and up all the way around the fabric so

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.390 
and up all the way around the fabric so
the<00:06:02.900> way<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.050> do<00:06:03.289> this<00:06:03.440> is<00:06:03.710> as<00:06:04.069> you<00:06:04.219> can<00:06:04.250> see

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
the way to do this is as you can see

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.309 
the way to do this is as you can see
here<00:06:04.789> to<00:06:04.940> just<00:06:05.150> start<00:06:05.479> each<00:06:05.750> color<00:06:06.080> on<00:06:06.289> a

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
here to just start each color on a

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.760 
here to just start each color on a
separate<00:06:06.740> needle<00:06:07.039> blue<00:06:07.520> purple<00:06:08.409> green<00:06:09.409> pink

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
separate needle blue purple green pink

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.820 
separate needle blue purple green pink
and<00:06:10.120> green<00:06:11.120> just<00:06:11.990> start<00:06:12.229> each<00:06:12.379> color<00:06:12.620> on<00:06:12.740> a

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
and green just start each color on a

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.909 
and green just start each color on a
separate<00:06:13.159> needle<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:13.610> then<00:06:14.180> -<00:06:14.479> as<00:06:14.919> you're

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
separate needle and then - as you're

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.800 
separate needle and then - as you're
working<00:06:16.039> just<00:06:18.490> work<00:06:19.490> to<00:06:19.849> the<00:06:19.969> end<00:06:20.000> of<00:06:20.449> a<00:06:20.690> given

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
working just work to the end of a given

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.029 
working just work to the end of a given
needle<00:06:21.259> with<00:06:21.979> the<00:06:22.099> right<00:06:22.279> color<00:06:25.930> drop<00:06:26.930> it

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
needle with the right color drop it

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.010 
needle with the right color drop it
and<00:06:28.129> then<00:06:28.669> just<00:06:28.849> pick<00:06:28.969> up<00:06:29.119> the<00:06:29.419> next<00:06:29.749> color

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
and then just pick up the next color

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.959 
and then just pick up the next color
that's<00:06:30.499> hanging<00:06:30.740> there<00:06:31.039> you<00:06:31.520> can<00:06:31.639> see<00:06:31.819> what

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
that's hanging there you can see what

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.909 
that's hanging there you can see what
one<00:06:32.089> of<00:06:32.119> the<00:06:32.270> problems<00:06:32.719> of<00:06:32.960> this<00:06:33.289> met<00:06:33.529> of<00:06:33.740> this

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
one of the problems of this met of this

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.619 
one of the problems of this met of this
method<00:06:34.279> is<00:06:34.430> that<00:06:34.639> your<00:06:34.759> yarns<00:06:35.089> do<00:06:35.270> tend<00:06:35.479> to<00:06:35.509> get

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
method is that your yarns do tend to get

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.629 
method is that your yarns do tend to get
tangled<00:06:36.050> really<00:06:36.289> quickly<00:06:36.680> so<00:06:37.279> you<00:06:37.339> need<00:06:37.550> to

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
tangled really quickly so you need to

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.540 
tangled really quickly so you need to
stop<00:06:37.909> and<00:06:38.059> untangle<00:06:38.740> frequently<00:06:39.740> so<00:06:40.339> just

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
stop and untangle frequently so just

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.999 
stop and untangle frequently so just
pick<00:06:40.699> up<00:06:40.729> the<00:06:40.909> next<00:06:41.119> color<00:06:41.419> and<00:06:41.830> just<00:06:42.830> keep

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
pick up the next color and just keep

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.359 
pick up the next color and just keep
working<00:06:43.839> now<00:06:44.839> for<00:06:45.289> this<00:06:45.409> method<00:06:45.619> you<00:06:45.919> can<00:06:45.949> only

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:46.369 
working now for this method you can only

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.429 
working now for this method you can only
have<00:06:46.610> wipes<00:06:47.089> that<00:06:47.240> are<00:06:47.360> one<00:06:47.509> row<00:06:47.719> high<00:06:47.930> but

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:48.439
