00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.110
 good in this part I proposed you 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.969
 a method to apply to learn 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.469
 a chord grid avoiding all 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.160
 traps and the classic mistakes of 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.480
 beginners the very first things to 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.380
 to do when you're facing a 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.270
 chord grid of a piece you 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.520
 do not know it's already to look 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.289
 which agreements you do not know 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.789
 in the piece if the disagreements that 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.260
 you do not know how to get 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.520
 the chord diagrams learn them 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.200
 parker 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.280
 do not try to play the song if 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.780
 chords we did not leave by heart 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.390
 you are going to crash and lose 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.249
 time once again you know that 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.579
 you are sure to know all the 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:41.569
 parker agreements and well you will play 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.249
 simply the chord grid of the 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:44.870
 start at the end we play on once 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.489
 every deal you do not take the lead 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.550
 on the beat or other things like 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.539
 it just play once every chord of 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.699
 start to finish 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.170
 no need to be regular no pace 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.170
 no fuss 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.489
 when you do that note what 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.229
 chord changes are difficult 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.780
 write down what you have fingers 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.250
 pivot note all the information that 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.990
 you want kind attention to small 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.220
 fingers at that place that will help you to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.960
 work all that afterwards 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.729
 it's a scouting job for 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.820
 try to see where that's stuck 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.869
 or does it go well etc etc a 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.119
 once you've done this work of 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.829
 tracking and well you're going to isolate the 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.909
 difficulties that is to say that you are going 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.899
 take the chords that puts you 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.640
 problem or chord changes 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.869
 that are problematic and you are going 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.149
 work alone 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.369
 on their side without working the rest of the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.350
 piece do not attack you a piece 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.820
 complete if there is a day of agreement on 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.009
 which you really can not 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.240
 all this will be useless you will be 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.280
 unable to play the complete piece 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 correctly so take each of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.920
 difficulties everyone agree we are in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.829
 path of agreement that you have problem 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.630
 and work alone once 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.390
 it's done it will have to be interested in 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.920
 pace and therefore to know the number of 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.259
 time that you will play for each 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.609
 okay so for that you can you 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.710
 refer to what I have what I talked about 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.119
 in the short how to find the rhythm 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.109
 of a piece you can base yourself on 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.490
 what is written on tablatures 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.170
 whatever 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.640
 the goal of the game is simply to know 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.229
 how long will you play by 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.880
 accor and not to tempt you to 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.499
 level there so do not hesitate to note them 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 also for example could write to 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.380
 tobacco kills red or print it yourself 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.280
 indicate in parentheses who expects from 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 tone anything for you as a souvenir 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.300
 once it's done and well you 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.000
 will you tackle the fact of playing the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
 life okay 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.990
 in rhythm but with the most rhythm 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.360
 simple that is to say that you 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.490
 go black, that means that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.070
 on each time you will play a 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.510
 blow down point bar so 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.950
 when you're going to have an agreement that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.960
 will last four times you will play 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.850
 four strokes down simply 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.080
 and you move on to the next race that 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.430
 will be played during two times by 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.110
 example someone you will play two 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.100
 shots down then after you have 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.620
 another four-year deal including 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.690
 four shots down etc etc 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.520
 the goal of the game this step is to be 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.680
 able to play the whole piece of 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.570
 beginning to end without bearing in the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.670
 agreements without counting in the 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.980
 chord sequences without slowing down in 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.709
 staying steady from start to finish 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.260
 if you do not succeed and well again 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.340
 once isolated the difficulties find 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.930
 chord changes that puts you 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.450
 problem or passages a little bit 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.010
 difficult and work the thoroughly done 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.930
 it's been a lot of times played really 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.610
 complete piece without stopping with 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.890
 that discovered the bottom perfectly 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 regular increase little by little the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.440
 speed up to the tempo of the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.480
 original piece 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.640
 do not hesitate to go beyond 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.690
 original even if you manage to play 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.700
 faster perfectly well you there 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.310
 will get even better at the good 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.110
 speed and if you get to play this 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.390
 piece from beginning to end without us 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.989
 to plant with that discovered the bottom but 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.030
 I want to say congratulations 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.470
 because you already know how to play the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.790
 piece 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.560
 certainly rhythmic is not evolved from 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.150
 everything but you are able 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.530
 to accompany anyone 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.900
 sing on this piece yourself or 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.320
 someone else will be enough to play 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.940
 the piece 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.590
 you can even get invited on 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.540
 scene by a group to play it with 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.730
 them if you want you are able to 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.970
 play this piece all the rest we're going 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.040
 see 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.660
 after that it's more stuff for the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.640
 make it even more interesting but the 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.200
 base is that once you have 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.930
 successful this step you know how to play the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.180
 piece so then to go over 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.799
 far you have two possibilities 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.079
 if you want to sing at the same time as 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.250
 you play the piece eh ben do not hesitate 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.840
 not to begin to work singing 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.280
 right away while you're 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.430
 yet to make blacks to make 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.109
 shots down with your right hand 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.459
 since you will not have too much to take you 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.660
 the head on the guitar you will be able to 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.410
 focus on singing and do it 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.720
 correctly 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.640
 just make sure you're always 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.800
 regular on the guitar and do not you 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.599
 enter the agreements do not stay 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.220
 singing at the expense of agreements otherwise 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.140
 you will try afterwards 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.270
 if you do not want to sing or if you 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.080
 want to work that later and well 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.030
 you can start doing some 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.060
 more evolved rhythmic at the right hand 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.620
 so for that and ben I still refer 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.540
 once in the course how to find the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.830
 replica of a piece that will tell you 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.600
 how to know which rhythm you 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.530
 can play on this piece so is 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.390
 you can start making 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.860
 more and more advanced replicas of 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.120
 more and more complex while 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.820
 always respecting the right number of 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.310
 time by accor the regularity the days 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.690
 okay and all that is very careful 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.770
 not to grill steps 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.630
 if I tell you to do all that in 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.850
 order is to avoid losing 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.650
 time to have to go back if at 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.880
 any step you have trouble 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.860
 do not hesitate to go back to step 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.900
 Previous and do their good 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 worked well spent time on everything 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.950
 that the more you will go fast it's in 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.360
 this learning more you will lose 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.770
 of time before being already a very good 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.580
 guitarist but technically if you 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.400
 watch this video is that you are 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.450
 beginner so do not blame me for 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.620
 people on a guitarist and you find 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.110
 that it does not apply to you it's 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.380
 normal that's all I have to you 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.660
 say 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.360
 take your time do it step by 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.650
 step take the time to write everything 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.120
 what you can to help you in 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.290
 your learning the fingers he 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.720
 must pay attention to the number of times 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.250
 and it is always always respect the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.020
 rhythmic structure the good end of time 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.450
 I beg you it's unbearable 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.500
 to see guitarists slaughtering 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.729
 pieces because they take away time 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.030
 left to right just because it 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.740
 fun it's not good at all and

 next to approach during 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.280
 guitar I went back to do the dishes 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.729
 and I will try to survive 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.729
 ciao
