00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.940 

let's<00:01:29.969> look<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.360> part<00:01:30.719> one<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.320> song<00:01:31.619> nice

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
let's look at part one of this song nice

00:01:31.950 --> 00:02:02.839 
let's look at part one of this song nice
and<00:01:32.189> slow<00:02:00.890> behind<00:02:01.890> bars<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.459> key<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.700> E

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
and slow behind bars is in the key of E

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.839 
and slow behind bars is in the key of E
minor<00:02:03.209> there<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.140> two<00:02:04.289> parts<00:02:04.679> this<00:02:05.310> lesson<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
minor there are two parts this lesson is

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.479 
minor there are two parts this lesson is
about<00:02:05.909> part<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.750> we've<00:02:07.470> got<00:02:07.500> two<00:02:07.860> goals<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
about part one we've got two goals the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.969 
about part one we've got two goals the
first<00:02:09.390> goal<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:10.259> our<00:02:10.380> pages<00:02:10.739> are

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
first goal is to see how our pages are

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.800 
first goal is to see how our pages are
used<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.400> song<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.000> we're<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> relate

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
used in a song and we're going to relate

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
used in a song and we're going to relate
it<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.470> form<00:02:13.830> theory<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> chords

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it to the to form theory of chords

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.780 
it to the to form theory of chords
scales<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.239> arpeggios<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.860> second<00:02:17.190> goal<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
scales and arpeggios the second goal is

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.720 
scales and arpeggios the second goal is
to<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.239> how<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.450> pentatonic<00:02:19.019> works<00:02:19.920> great

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
to see how the pentatonic works great

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.460 
to see how the pentatonic works great
for<00:02:20.760> building<00:02:21.239> tension<00:02:21.480> over<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> five<00:02:22.230> seven

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
for building tension over a five seven

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.670 
for building tension over a five seven
chord<00:02:23.390> let's<00:02:24.390> walk<00:02:24.599> through<00:02:24.630> each<00:02:24.989> chord<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
chord let's walk through each chord and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.400 
chord let's walk through each chord and
then<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.220> arpeggio<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.910> unravels<00:02:27.299> we<00:02:28.140> start

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
then the arpeggio that unravels we start

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.800 
then the arpeggio that unravels we start
on<00:02:28.620> an<00:02:28.739> E<00:02:28.920> minor<00:02:29.160> chord<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.790> actually<00:02:30.269> for

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
on an E minor chord and actually for

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.770 
on an E minor chord and actually for
these<00:02:30.930> two<00:02:31.170> chords<00:02:31.530> e<00:02:31.650> minor<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.400> B<00:02:33.120> we're

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
these two chords e minor and B we're

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.900 
these two chords e minor and B we're
going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.319> focus<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.190> minor<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.760> we're

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
going to just focus on a minor so we're

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.449 
going to just focus on a minor so we're
thinking<00:02:36.209> globally<00:02:36.660> over<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:36.989> measure<00:02:37.459> we

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
thinking globally over this measure we

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.840 
thinking globally over this measure we
have<00:02:38.489> an<00:02:38.670> E<00:02:38.790> minor<00:02:39.030> chord<00:02:39.799> arpeggio<00:02:40.799> from<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
have an E minor chord arpeggio from the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.120 
have an E minor chord arpeggio from the
form<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.480> shape<00:02:43.019> minor<00:02:43.380> chord<00:02:43.739> looks<00:02:43.980> like

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
form one a shape minor chord looks like

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.009 
form one a shape minor chord looks like
this<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:48.060> course<00:02:48.299> we<00:02:48.450> learned<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> our

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
this of course we learned that in our

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.449 
this of course we learned that in our
lessons<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:49.709> gonna<00:02:49.799> add<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.220> note

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
lessons and we're gonna add this note

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.050 
lessons and we're gonna add this note
it's<00:02:50.940> actually<00:02:51.150> right<00:02:51.630> from<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> minor<00:02:52.170> scale

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it's actually right from the minor scale

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.819 
it's actually right from the minor scale
here's<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> arpeggio<00:02:57.109> here's<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.290> lick<00:02:59.329> and

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
here's the arpeggio here's the lick and

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.789 
here's the arpeggio here's the lick and
then<00:03:01.829> we<00:03:01.920> add<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.250> note<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:04.290> next<00:03:04.530> chord

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
then we add that note the next chord

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.379 
then we add that note the next chord
that<00:03:04.889> we're<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.280> highlight<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.970> going

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
that we're going to highlight is going

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.900 
that we're going to highlight is going
to<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> D<00:03:06.900> chord<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.019> chord<00:03:10.910> the
