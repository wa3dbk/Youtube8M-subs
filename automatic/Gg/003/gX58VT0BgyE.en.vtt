the<00:02:25.970> ideal<00:02:26.060> situation<00:02:26.450> back<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
the ideal situation back then and it

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.770 
the ideal situation back then and it
wasn't<00:02:28.340> even<00:02:28.370> acted<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.910> wasn't<00:02:29.180> even<00:02:29.330> half<00:02:29.569> of
