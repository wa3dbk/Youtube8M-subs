we pre tell oven at about 350 degree

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.910 
we pre tell oven at about 350 degree
fahrenheit<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:48.140> we're<00:03:48.320> going<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.470> we're

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
fahrenheit then we're going to we're

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.110 
fahrenheit then we're going to we're
going<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.100> bake<00:03:49.220> them<00:03:49.400> now

i<00:03:57.260> would<00:03:58.260> say<00:03:58.440> we'll<00:03:58.620> start<00:03:58.890> with<00:03:59.150> 12<00:04:00.150> minutes

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
i would say we'll start with 12 minutes

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.059 
i would say we'll start with 12 minutes
and<00:04:00.870> see<00:04:01.140> where<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.349> takes<00:04:01.409> us<00:04:06.739> okay<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.799> it's

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
and see where that takes us okay so it's

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.289 
and see where that takes us okay so it's
been<00:04:08.220> about<00:04:08.250> 20<00:04:08.700> minutes<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:10.519> water<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:12.120> olive
