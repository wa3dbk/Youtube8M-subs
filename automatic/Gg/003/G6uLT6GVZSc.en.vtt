00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.190 

every<00:00:03.030> time<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.330> group<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.600> guys<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> ride

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
every time the group of guys that a ride

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.050 
every time the group of guys that a ride
would<00:00:04.410> stop<00:00:04.650> at<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.830> fuel<00:00:05.100> station<00:00:05.370> we've<00:00:05.879> all

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
would stop at a fuel station we've all

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.430 
would stop at a fuel station we've all
got<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.270> compare<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.810> see<00:00:06.960> who<00:00:07.080> bought<00:00:07.290> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
got to compare to see who bought the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.259 
got to compare to see who bought the
most<00:00:07.620> amount<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.919> gas<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.370> fill<00:00:08.519> up<00:00:08.639> their<00:00:08.760> sled

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
most amount of gas to fill up their sled

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.180 
most amount of gas to fill up their sled
I<00:00:09.300> think<00:00:09.719> it's<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.900> snowmobiler<00:00:10.440> thing<00:00:10.679> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
I think it's a snowmobiler thing to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.950 
I think it's a snowmobiler thing to
compare<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.849> buddy<00:00:12.090> sled<00:00:12.389> against<00:00:12.719> another

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
compare one buddy sled against another

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.390 
compare one buddy sled against another
to<00:00:13.170> see<00:00:13.349> if<00:00:13.440> they've<00:00:13.590> done<00:00:13.620> something<00:00:13.799> better

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
to see if they've done something better

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.609 
to see if they've done something better
or<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> only<00:00:16.020> thing<00:00:16.379> worse<00:00:16.590> than

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
or not now but the only thing worse than

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.349 
or not now but the only thing worse than
being<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> guy<00:00:17.310> who<00:00:17.340> had<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> buy<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> most

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
being the guy who had to buy the most

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
being the guy who had to buy the most
fuel<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.690> fill<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:18.960> their<00:00:19.080> sled<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.800> I'm

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
fuel to fill up their sled and I'm

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.880 
fuel to fill up their sled and I'm
usually<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.880> guy<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.230> guy<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.380> ran<00:00:22.859> out

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
usually that guy is the guy that ran out

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
usually that guy is the guy that ran out
of<00:00:23.070> gas<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> way<00:00:23.789> into<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> station<00:00:24.539> and

of gas on the way into the station and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.140 
of gas on the way into the station and
I've<00:00:25.380> been<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.830> guy<00:00:26.010> too<00:00:28.609> to<00:00:29.609> help<00:00:29.730> solve<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I've been that guy too to help solve the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
I've been that guy too to help solve the
problem<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.689> running<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.769> everybody<00:00:31.949> has

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
problem of running out to everybody has

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
problem of running out to everybody has
been<00:00:32.399> producing<00:00:32.820> these<00:00:32.940> auxilary<00:00:33.390> fuel<00:00:33.780> tanks

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
been producing these auxilary fuel tanks

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.360 
been producing these auxilary fuel tanks
for<00:00:34.290> snowmobiles<00:00:34.770> since<00:00:35.340> 1996<00:00:37.129> let<00:00:38.129> me<00:00:38.219> show

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
for snowmobiles since 1996 let me show

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.170 
for snowmobiles since 1996 let me show
you<00:00:38.430> how<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> works

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you how it works

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.819 
you how it works
think<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.870> jar<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.350> main<00:00:40.530> fuel<00:00:40.800> tank

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
think of this jar is your main fuel tank

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.500 
think of this jar is your main fuel tank
and<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.760> over<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.210> your<00:00:42.390> tour

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and this one over here is your tour

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.630 
and this one over here is your tour
buddy<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> engine<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
buddy now I'm going to be the engine and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.459 
buddy now I'm going to be the engine and
pull<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> vacuum<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> main<00:00:45.960> fuel<00:00:46.200> line

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
pull a vacuum out of the main fuel line

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.810 
pull a vacuum out of the main fuel line
here<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.710> would<00:00:46.950> normally<00:00:47.100> feed<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> engine

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
here that would normally feed the engine

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.100 
here that would normally feed the engine
as<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.969> vacuum<00:00:51.239> created<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
as I do there's a vacuum created in the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.869 
as I do there's a vacuum created in the
tank<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.440> begins<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> draw<00:00:53.160> fuel<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> the

tank that begins to draw fuel out of the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.410 
tank that begins to draw fuel out of the
auxilary

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
auxilary

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
auxilary
you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> fuel<00:00:55.829> being<00:00:56.039> drawn<00:00:56.370> into

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you can see the fuel being drawn into

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
you can see the fuel being drawn into
the<00:00:56.789> main<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> second<00:00:58.050> tank<00:00:58.230> even

the main from the second tank even

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
the main from the second tank even
though<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.250> pulling<00:00:59.609> fuel<00:00:59.850> directly

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
