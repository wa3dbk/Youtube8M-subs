00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.570
 hi hello my loves I hope you are well and 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.000
 I am excellent the day is beautiful and 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.890
 I wanted to do this tuto in Spanish 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.830
 to be using a striped tape to 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.619
 do this design I love I hope them 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.449
 like remember signing handyman 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.750
 up and leave your comments we are going to 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.119
 start before applying my enamel 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.340
 I always start by applying two layers of 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.190
 first because my nails are a bit 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.769
 greasy you can also use alcohol 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.950
 to dry the nail very well and so our 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.510
 enamel is more durable 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.390
 now I'm going to take a colored glaze 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.810
 cinnamon a light coffee and I'm going to apply two 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.059
 thin layers to all my fingers with the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.680
 exception of my ring finger and make sure 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.790
 that each layer is that before applying 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.470
 other 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.830
 only to my ring finger I will apply 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.870
 a purple or reddish color like this that 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.170
 it has enough brightness and I'm going to apply 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.479
 two thin layers and make sure each 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.400
 layer dries before applying another one 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:15.490
 layer if you're not going to make a mess leave 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.250
 that the enamels dry completely 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.800
 now I will take my inÃ©s and henar value 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.470
 that makes matt glazes 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.460
 nothing else I'm going to apply a layer but it 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.320
 generous this matte glaze is very 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.800
 fashion and it's going to be perfect for 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.330
 autumn-winter is super fun super 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.330
 easy and you will love them 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.540
 let the polish dry completely 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 now I will continue with my part 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.800
 favorite I'm going to apply a tape of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.860
 stripes to create different designs in 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.410
 my nails take their time if you take a 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.960
 little bit of practice but it 's a way 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.020
 very father to make different designs in 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.540
 the nails do not have to be perfect just 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.940
 you have to be creative and each nail can 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.100
 have a different design does not have to 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.000
 be all the same or all perfect because 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.459
 they will see that with errors they create very 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.459
 pretty so have fun with this 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 when it is about to finish the application of 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.410
 the ribbon you can now apply the color 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.930
 purple all the nails that here and I'm going to 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.050
 be applying a generous layer and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.420
 just one layer take your time and 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.280
 be careful because the tape makes 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.280
 this work is a little bit more difficult 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.750
 before the enamel starts to dry 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 begin to remove the tape that we apply 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.780
 and be very careful, do it with 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.450
 patience and they'll see what they're going to see 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.620
 beautiful look nothing else the result to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.620
 I love it 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.329
 now if we can continue with the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.700
 next one for me a dwelling I'm going to 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.980
 be applying the khaki color and with this 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.469
 color since it is a little bit less this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.159
 concentrate I'm going to apply two coats or 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:21.450
 a generous layer and it starts to be the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:24.780
 Same step with the other nails too 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.239
 continue with the others this gives 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.819
