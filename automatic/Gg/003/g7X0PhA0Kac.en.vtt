00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 ok if perhaps today I come with 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:28.599
 you with this video about these nails 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.000
 let's make a little has is 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.110
 rather, I think that I'm going to teach 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.900
 to do is super super super happy and I 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.360
 they asked for them a lot, I do not know why 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.159
 what I wear is the chrome bit 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.579
 whenever I put them on 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.890
 Chile do not like them much then 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.300
 another day I did a tutorial brought all 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.059
 the nails was like that 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 and they liked it and they asked me to tell them 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.190
 what enamel was so why do not you 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.160
 I show better how it's done so this 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.000
 is the video is super super simple 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.190
 true 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.590
 are you going to make a video teach us 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.869
 this but super simple and I wanted 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.909
 leave them because you asked for it 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.700
 so leave me in comments what 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.600
 videos want to see and thank you very much for 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.800
 watch the video 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.110
 I hope you like it and I'll leave it with him 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.420
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.570
 Mars of the color you want 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.730
 this one that I'm using from miguelÃ­n and the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.890
 color is called forever war green 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.770
 what I like this glaze is that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.480
 has a very broad brush that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.530
 past reaches cover the entire nail 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.950
 leave the ring finger free 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.440
 and in that we're going to apply the leader in 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.570
 this case I'm going to use golden leader 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.150
 that's why I'm going to be using this 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.770
 visu enamel in golden color that 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.120
 call 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.760
 18 carats 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.160
 I'm going to cover the nail with all the enamel 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.260
 and it does not matter if it's a thin layer 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.310
 you can only get it to stick 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.310
 the bright 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.569
 since I have it ready 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.579
 I'm going to take my glitter, this is a 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.630
 tooth in the kitchen I'm going to introduce 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:25.350
 your wrist with the enamel is still wet 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.420
 and once I did 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.420
 can shake off any excess 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.299
 and with this kind of brush or any 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:43.040
 type of brush you have 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.400
 shake off the excess 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.750
 with a transparent glaze I will cover 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.319
 the entire nail so that it is protected and ready 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.879
 that's how our leader is 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.459
 I recommend you give him two or three 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.859
 layers of transparent color so that it 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.230
 be more fixed to do so let's do 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.230
 the same with the other nail reminds 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.780
 First put the enamel the color that 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.910
 are you going to put the glitter i chose the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.480
 golden and that's why I'm using this 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.580
 but if you have chosen a face 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.520
 I would put the pink enamel 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.790
 I can serve as a base for any 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.170
 space that we left without brightness and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.550
 same time will help us stick 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.480
 then as a disk 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.480
 note 1 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.670
 and it happens to them 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.670
 we eliminate the excess where tapping 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.900
 and then with a brush 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.070
 we shake everything that does not stay and ready 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.070
 this is how it is
