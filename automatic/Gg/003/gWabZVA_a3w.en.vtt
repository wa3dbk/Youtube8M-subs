00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.640 
this one it just brings the weight down
right<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.590> keeps<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.070> centrally<00:00:23.789> located

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
right it keeps it centrally located

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
right it keeps it centrally located
center<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.740> gravity<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> lower<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.720> feels

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
center of gravity is lower and it feels

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.839 
center of gravity is lower and it feels
great<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> big<00:00:29.099> fan<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> this

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
great I'm a big fan of this

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.339 
great I'm a big fan of this
the<00:00:30.029> other<00:00:30.150> cool<00:00:30.330> thing<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.019> that

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the other cool thing is you can see that

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410 
the other cool thing is you can see that
there's<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:31.679> braised<00:00:32.070> ons<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
there's these braised ons here where you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
there's these braised ons here where you
can<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:34.219> actually<00:00:35.219> they're<00:00:35.370> threaded

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
can actually actually they're threaded

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.639 
can actually actually they're threaded
shredded<00:00:36.570> eyelets<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.020> guess<00:00:37.200> where<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> can

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
shredded eyelets I guess where you can

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.680 
shredded eyelets I guess where you can
add<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.070> own<00:00:38.129> rack<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.820> fenders<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.300> kind

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
add your own rack or fenders that kind

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
add your own rack or fenders that kind
of<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:41.000> that<00:00:42.000> means<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> can

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
of thing and that means that you can

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
of thing and that means that you can
actually<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.670> portage

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
actually use this to you know portage

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.080 
actually use this to you know portage
things<00:00:45.510> around<00:00:46.160> again<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.489> older<00:00:47.760> battery

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
things around again the older battery

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
things around again the older battery
packs<00:00:48.300> didn't<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> rack<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> top

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
packs didn't really have a rack on top

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
packs didn't really have a rack on top
so<00:00:50.219> let<00:00:50.460> me<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.670> hit<00:00:50.820> some<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> specs

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
so let me just hit some of the specs

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.430 
so let me just hit some of the specs
here<00:00:52.309> we've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.550> three<00:00:54.329> speeds<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.230> left

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
here we've got three speeds on the left

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.490 
here we've got three speeds on the left
that's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.739> grip<00:00:55.980> shifter<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.109> then<00:00:58.109> we've<00:00:58.260> got

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that's a grip shifter and then we've got

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.369 
that's a grip shifter and then we've got
nine<00:00:58.829> speeds<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.300> 27<00:01:00.930> speed

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
nine speeds on the right so 27 speed

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799 
nine speeds on the right so 27 speed
this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.520> pedelec<00:01:03.180> bike<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this is only a pedelec bike and so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.050 
this is only a pedelec bike and so
having<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.040> those<00:01:05.400> speeds<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.030> choose

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
having all of those speeds to choose

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
having all of those speeds to choose
from<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> make<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.860> more

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
from is really going to make this more

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
from is really going to make this more
enjoyable<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.119> ride<00:01:09.390> right<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.990> climb

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
enjoyable to ride right you can climb

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
enjoyable to ride right you can climb
with<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.159> basically<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
with this thing it's basically a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.140 
with this thing it's basically a
hardtail<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.350> almost<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.880> call

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
hardtail it would almost you know call

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
hardtail it would almost you know call
it<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> mountain<00:01:15.840> bike<00:01:15.990> except<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it like a mountain bike except for that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
it like a mountain bike except for that
it's<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.729> these<00:01:17.880> slick<00:01:18.240> tires<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it's got these slick tires on in this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
it's got these slick tires on in this
case<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.610> course<00:01:20.820> it'll<00:01:20.970> work<00:01:21.030> great

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
case and of course it'll work great

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
case and of course it'll work great
cruising<00:01:21.750> around<00:01:21.840> town<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
cruising around town that's going to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
cruising around town that's going to
dampen<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> vibration<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.580> everything<00:01:23.909> it's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
dampen the vibration and everything it's

actually<00:01:24.960> got<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> little<00:01:25.290> display<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.610> here

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
actually got a little display up here

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
actually got a little display up here
and<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.840> integrated<00:01:28.290> these

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and it's not really integrated these

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
and it's not really integrated these
things<00:01:28.650> aren't<00:01:28.829> combined<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> display

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
things aren't combined but the display

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.399 
things aren't combined but the display
works<00:01:30.180> well<00:01:30.570> enough<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.110> gives<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
works well enough and it gives you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
works well enough and it gives you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
really good this back here at first it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.469 
really good this back here at first it
you<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.439> looks<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.479> don't

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you know kind of looks like a I don't

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
you know kind of looks like a I don't
know<00:01:54.570> almost<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.990> an<00:01:55.200> internally<00:01:55.710> geared

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
know almost like an internally geared

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.980 
know almost like an internally geared
hub<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
hub but as you can see there's a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.450 
hub but as you can see there's a
cassette<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.560> next<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.219> not

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
cassette right next to it so that's not

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
cassette right next to it so that's not
the<00:01:59.579> case<00:01:59.759> that's<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.090> 250<00:02:01.049> watt<00:02:01.259> geared<00:02:01.710> motor

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the case that's a 250 watt geared motor

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.450 
the case that's a 250 watt geared motor
it<00:02:02.340> almost<00:02:02.520> uses<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> clutch<00:02:03.619> right<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.340> way

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it almost uses a clutch right so the way

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.280 
it almost uses a clutch right so the way
it<00:02:05.579> works<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> motor<00:02:06.299> spins<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.990> speed

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it works is the motor spins up to speed

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.930 
it works is the motor spins up to speed
and<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.590> kind<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.979> silent

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and it's kind of this silent

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.060 
and it's kind of this silent
electronic<00:02:10.720> sound<00:02:10.960> and<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.740> spinning

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
electronic sound and as it's spinning

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.740 
electronic sound and as it's spinning
that<00:02:12.160> any<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.640> engages<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.540> there's<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
that any it engages and so there's a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.050 
that any it engages and so there's a
really<00:02:14.080> smooth<00:02:14.380> takeoff<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.700> uses<00:02:15.880> a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
really smooth takeoff and it uses a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.490 
really smooth takeoff and it uses a
torque<00:02:16.480> sensor<00:02:16.870> back<00:02:17.020> here

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
torque sensor back here

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.380 
torque sensor back here
so<00:02:17.830> as<00:02:18.100> you're<00:02:18.280> pedaling<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.000> bike<00:02:19.030> just

propels<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.330> up<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.750> speed<00:02:23.020> it's<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.260> great

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
propels you up to speed it's a great

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.790 
propels you up to speed it's a great
