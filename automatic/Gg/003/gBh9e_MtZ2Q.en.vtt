giving us a post release height or flare
we'll<00:00:40.880> watch<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.329> again<00:00:41.450> here<00:00:42.130> after<00:00:43.130> the

we'll watch it again here after the

we'll watch it again here after the
actual<00:00:43.820> CM<00:00:44.300> e<00:00:44.450> release<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.380> see<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:45.829> bright

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
actual CM e release you see the bright

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.370 
actual CM e release you see the bright
flare<00:00:46.579> afterwards<00:00:47.510> that's<00:00:47.899> how<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:48.140> works

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
flare afterwards that's how it works

flare afterwards that's how it works
with<00:00:48.620> filaments<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.340> flare<00:00:49.640> if<00:00:49.880> any<00:00:50.300> comes

after<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.710> CME<00:00:52.340> what's<00:00:53.120> most<00:00:53.390> interesting<00:00:53.600> is

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
after the CME what's most interesting is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.200 
after the CME what's most interesting is
that<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:54.620> may<00:00:54.860> just<00:00:54.890> be<00:00:55.190> half<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.940> chain

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210
