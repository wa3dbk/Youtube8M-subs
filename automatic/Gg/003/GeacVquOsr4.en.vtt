 to work the videos to the class itself 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 instagram photos like on twitter and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969
 Well the truth is that it is not

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.960

 what I room before anything 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 I want to clarify that I do this because 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.300
 you are not asking and I do not have 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.329
 intention to brag about anything 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.969
 It fell and I leave you watching it and good 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.350
 Well, I'm going to start 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.539
 teaching is a bit like that over like 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 more in detail so good 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 I'm going to focus a little bit on being 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.810
 I teach I can not take much for 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.460
 forgive me if I do not record it very well 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.380
 because I'm not used to wearing the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 good camera, what most calls the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 attention of my room is the mural 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.909
 that I have there and good this mural is what 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220

 English court I do not know how to say exactly 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.799
 where I do not know exactly how to say 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.810
 many model you have asked me 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.240
 but surely if you search the internet 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.030
 you can find it good then according to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.429

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.360

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.200
 There are some outside that I share with my 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.819
 sister but good this is the first thing 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 what's here on the right and good if 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.939
 You want me to teach you that will have to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.190
 be in another video already entering more 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.859
 detail the first thing I have is this 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.109
 mannequin that good is not mine is borrowed 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.710
 but meanwhile I have it here put 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.600
 in the corner 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.520
 this dress that the truth that is super 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.010
 nice it looks more orange than in 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.190
 reality is it's more pink and it's more of the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.040
 color of flowers but well that's what 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.530
 that I have there and then here I have my 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 side table 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.040
 and well you know that I keep the most 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.110
 part of my makeup here but also 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.459
 I tell you that if you want to see my collection 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.010
 of makeup also tell me 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.830
 in the comments and good here in the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.870
 What I have is a lamp from the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.420
 ikea a vanilla candle because i 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.600
 love how an old photo smells and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.730
 this series of small yes and then I have 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
 this picture day as well if 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.670
 you want to see how I did it I'm going to put the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.250
 link there so you can see it 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.110
 well then the next thing that there is my 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.760
 bed and well this is my bed now what 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.250
 you have seen is a pretty big bed 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.959
 and I have to say that normally 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180
 these sheets that you see are on 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.770
 as with turquoise tones but I have 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.569
 some white then the bed is white 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.840
 and pink but well these were a gift 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.520
 in life so they are here and 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.840
 the truth that I like the touch that 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.819
 gives a more bluish touch to the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.730
 room but usually only lanka and 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.950
 pink and you go the sheets are zara home 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.989
 and then this part of pink from here below 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.840
 that goes to the foot of the bed is 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.819
 ikea and that's it and then the cushions 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.350
 they are all working well 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.510
 on the back wall of my room 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.650
 I have some windows that give a 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.970
 sort of garden so that's why I 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.530
 I like it a lot because it's pretty bright 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.420
 I do not have any building that covers the light 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.010
 or whatever it is and good now I teach you 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.780
 this seems a little and good in this 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.100
 wall I have absolutely nothing alone 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.880
 I have three paintings that are good 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.630
 with the lights although it is crooked but 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.970
 they go as illuminated with the lights and 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.980
 good are those three pictures then 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.200
 I show what I have on top of the dresser 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.510
 the truth that the comfortable the only thing that 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.290
 I keep the pajamas and a short 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.580
 what I have here is this huge thing 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.310
 that you are going to ask me for sure and it is 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.989
 a modifier and well what I do is what 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.910
 I put before going to sleep and the truth 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.250
 amending atmosphere makes is 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.990
 I breathe and sleep much better and also 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.640
 he has added a few droplets of 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.260
 essential oils then all the 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.960
 Room smells super good and is super 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.360
 relaxing the truth that I like a lot and 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.610
 well then I have here a hydrangea and 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.950
 well I have them put in the tin of 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.200
 harris and sand that are the tests that already 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.380
 you know I like it very much then this 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.950
 What I have here is a candle that I finish 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.860
 to turn off and I burned it but it's white 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.540
 and good here then I have here my cactus 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.160
 how good I think it is the only thing alive 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.720
 I have in my room comes out a 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.950
 pretty roses flowers from now on 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.530
 winter 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.810
 nothing there and what I have as above also 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.750
 is the good one because it is my dressing table and 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.280
 You have seen it all but it's good 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.140
 changed a little bit since the last one 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.240
 because on this side what I have is the 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.950
 someone's cologne along with the creams 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.600
 that have been a gift and I've put them 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.700
 there because I love the color that it has 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 and the boat seems super nice and then 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.000
 the colonies that I use the most is 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.460
 lady million and then the abercrombie 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.840
 boy I love how it smells then 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.960
 in this case below 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.050
 I do not open it because in a mess and in the 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.230
 half what I have is a perfume bottle 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.530
 old that rescue from my grandmother's house 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.540
 then I have a snowball that I have put 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.490
 good for contribution is Christmas then 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.740
 this team is in the middle and then there 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.380
 I have an air freshener of these that smell 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.300
 ok but this will be done kits 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.910
 for children because it is definitely better than 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.460
 the one that smells better and good already on the side 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.540
 left and colony I have that is the one 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.430
 I'm using now every day 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.350
 then I have it put then I have 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.840
 this pompom that came with a sheath of 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.760
 mobile that I lost but the pompom 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.740
 I found with time and then I have my 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.550
 mirror that came with the plants of 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.490
 hair 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.520
 in this tin of tea for a change I have 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.140
 times more and 6 use is not 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.460
 ok to have them there because they are filled with 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.190
 dust and whatever but good here in the 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.530
 side a little like hiding I have this 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.350
 this little bottle of water that filled me 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.440
 at night because I'm always thirsty 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.730
 at night and then I have my the ones from 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.020
 another stories that I have done in my 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.889
 room so it smells good because 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.639
 same is super super good and teach 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.090

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:35.039
 so well, this is not my 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.020
 makeup collection practically the 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.879
 makeup here more by hand and then from 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.259
 This way is much easier when 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:42.240
 I have the brushes and the 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.409

 they gave away this kitchen towel and 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.909
