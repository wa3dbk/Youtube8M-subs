00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
woods up there it's like you expect

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.530 
woods up there it's like you expect
obviously<00:03:11.470> off<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.700> then<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:12.970> last<00:03:13.180> River

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
obviously off and then one last River

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:22.400 
obviously off and then one last River
across<00:03:13.840> right<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:18.840> quite<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.870> hole<00:03:20.400> in

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
across right so it's a quite a hole in

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.440 
across right so it's a quite a hole in
seventeen<00:03:23.410> tunes<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:27.090> Allies<00:03:28.090> that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
seventeen tunes for the Allies that

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.050 
seventeen tunes for the Allies that
could<00:03:28.780> crank<00:03:29.019> along<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.430> there<00:03:30.970> are

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
could crank along that and there are

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.640 
could crank along that and there are
also<00:03:31.209> some<00:03:31.450> blue<00:03:31.630> my<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:31.870> I'm<00:03:32.230> not<00:03:32.350> going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> go

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
also some blue my so I'm not going to go

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.759 
also some blue my so I'm not going to go
through<00:03:32.799> all<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:34.230> accounts<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.320> stuff<00:03:35.410> now

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
through all the accounts and stuff now

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.340 
through all the accounts and stuff now
but<00:03:36.340> we'll<00:03:36.580> do<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.150> separately<00:03:37.480> but<00:03:38.200> there

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
but we'll do that separately but there

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.680 
but we'll do that separately but there
are<00:03:38.410> these<00:03:38.500> nice<00:03:39.040> play<00:03:39.370> aids<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:40.090> actually

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
are these nice play aids that actually

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.789 
are these nice play aids that actually
outline<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.480> keep<00:03:43.660> track<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.900> your<00:03:44.080> the

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
outline you keep track of your the

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.160 
outline you keep track of your the
gliders<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.430> draughts<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.000> demos

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
gliders and draughts the demos

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.930 
gliders and draughts the demos
yeah<00:03:49.740> it's<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.830> reinforcement<00:03:51.310> shot<00:03:51.670> with<00:03:51.850> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
yeah it's a reinforcement shot with the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.330 
yeah it's a reinforcement shot with the
actual<00:03:52.240> images<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.020> counters<00:03:53.410> on<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.740> and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
actual images of the counters on it and

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.010 
actual images of the counters on it and
one<00:03:54.490> thing<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.670> struck<00:03:54.940> me<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.510> saying<00:03:55.720> for

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
one thing that struck me and saying for

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.860 
one thing that struck me and saying for
the<00:03:56.140> L<00:03:56.440> Idol<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.860> chats<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.940> keep<00:03:58.090> keep

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the L Idol of chats so you can keep keep

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.840 
the L Idol of chats so you can keep keep
track<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.200> your<00:03:59.319> salmon<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.950> mean<00:04:00.670> you're

with account as I will highlight one

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.250 
with account as I will highlight one
thing<00:04:10.590> as<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.740> know<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:12.459> battle<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.870> defense

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
thing as you know the battle the defense

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.360 
thing as you know the battle the defense
was<00:04:14.739> particularly<00:04:16.410> ad<00:04:17.410> hoc<00:04:17.739> in<00:04:17.980> terms<00:04:18.250> of

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
was particularly ad hoc in terms of

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.099 
was particularly ad hoc in terms of
number<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.609> Congress<00:04:19.030> will<00:04:19.180> put<00:04:19.329> together<00:04:19.419> on

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
number of Congress will put together on

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
number of Congress will put together on
that<00:04:20.410> ad<00:04:20.470> hoc<00:04:20.650> basis<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.280> they<00:04:21.340> changed<00:04:21.700> so

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
that ad hoc basis and they changed so

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.550 
that ad hoc basis and they changed so
many<00:04:21.970> different<00:04:22.390> occasions<00:04:22.600> will<00:04:23.350> note<00:04:23.530> that

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
many different occasions will note that

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.280 
many different occasions will note that
the<00:04:24.130> unit<00:04:25.090> designate<00:04:25.570> not<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.870> designation

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
the unit designate not that designation

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.070 
the unit designate not that designation
sorry<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.390> formations<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.780> unit

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
sorry the formations and the unit

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.320 
sorry the formations and the unit
strengths<00:04:29.590> they're<00:04:30.400> all<00:04:30.520> pretty<00:04:30.760> light<00:04:31.060> you

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
strengths they're all pretty light you

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.780 
strengths they're all pretty light you
know<00:04:31.450> there's<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.660> lot<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.900> ones<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:33.040> don't

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
know there's a lot of ones so I don't

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.180 
know there's a lot of ones so I don't
remember<00:04:34.240> seeing<00:04:34.630> any<00:04:34.919> changes<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:36.070> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
remember seeing any changes to the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.650 
remember seeing any changes to the
stacking<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:36.970> couldn't<00:04:37.180> interesting<00:04:37.570> to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
stacking so it couldn't interesting to

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.320 
stacking so it couldn't interesting to
see<00:04:37.840> if<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:42.280> Germans<00:04:42.669> can<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:43.060> know<00:04:43.120> pull

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
see if the the Germans can you know pull

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.909 
see if the the Germans can you know pull
together<00:04:43.450> some<00:04:43.840> decent<00:04:44.200> force<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.770> there

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
together some decent force and there

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.090 
together some decent force and there
that<00:04:45.160> some<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.700> SS<00:04:46.620> forces<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> little<00:04:47.950> bit

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
that some of the SS forces a little bit

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.010 
that some of the SS forces a little bit
stronger<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.030> more<00:04:49.419> complete<00:04:49.780> that's

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
stronger and a more complete that's

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.680 
stronger and a more complete that's
still<00:04:50.169> pretty<00:04:50.350> light<00:04:50.790> whereas<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:52.150> know<00:04:52.270> our

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
still pretty light whereas you know our

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.300 
still pretty light whereas you know our
exploit<00:04:53.500> capable<00:04:53.979> guys<00:04:55.320> yeah<00:04:56.320> have<00:04:56.919> more

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
exploit capable guys yeah have more

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.219 
exploit capable guys yeah have more
traditional<00:04:58.030> strength<00:04:58.390> ratios<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:58.960> we

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
traditional strength ratios that we

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.469 
traditional strength ratios that we
would<00:04:59.380> expect<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.860> see<00:05:00.180> maybe<00:05:01.180> there's<00:05:01.360> some

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
would expect to see maybe there's some

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.850 
would expect to see maybe there's some
light<00:05:01.660> paratroopers<00:05:02.260> new<00:05:02.380> stuff<00:05:02.620> there<00:05:02.740> as

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
light paratroopers new stuff there as

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.080 
light paratroopers new stuff there as
well<00:05:03.040> but<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:08.890> know<00:05:09.010> there's<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.340> 500<00:05:09.700> second

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
well but you know there's the 500 second

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.430 
well but you know there's the 500 second
there<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:11.820> you've<00:05:12.820> got<00:05:12.850> fourth<00:05:13.270> power<00:05:13.600> there

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
there and you've got fourth power there

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.500 
there and you've got fourth power there
first<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.280> all<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.580> good<00:05:15.790> stuff<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:16.150> they've

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
first and all that good stuff so they've

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.250 
first and all that good stuff so they've
got<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.810> all<00:05:16.900> here<00:05:17.970> pretty<00:05:18.970> significant<00:05:19.870> level

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
got it all here pretty significant level

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.219 
got it all here pretty significant level
of<00:05:20.350> detail<00:05:20.740> which<00:05:21.130> is<00:05:21.160> cool<00:05:22.090> for<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.840> SES

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
of detail which is cool for the SES

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.080 
of detail which is cool for the SES
system<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:24.160> like<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.400> said<00:05:24.460> it's<00:05:24.729> a<00:05:24.790> big<00:05:24.940> ass

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
system and like I said it's a big ass

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.850 
system and like I said it's a big ass
map<00:05:25.390> so<00:05:25.630> we'll<00:05:25.840> have<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.020> bit<00:05:26.530> of<00:05:26.560> fun<00:05:26.710> with<00:05:26.830> that

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860
