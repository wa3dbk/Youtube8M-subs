00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.350
 Today I will show you such a cool 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.130
 anti-afk system and that is built on 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.769
 attack first tell you its application 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 you play on the server let's say built 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 farm experience 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.650
 you need to stand turnout stand cost time 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 exclaimed go to the server and could 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.059
 all disappeared separate cry want 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.590
 when the authorities were at home everywhere you 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.469
 left the computer on 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.180
 get a bunch a bunch a bunch of experience okay 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 let's build this design set 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.539
 time two three 4 5 blocks here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.039
 spread four times one two three here and 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 one-two-three-four here we can do 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 of course the edge is full of any blocks 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.910
 for example separated but that is no difference 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.539
 the main thing that you did not kill the floor and on it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.840
 did not leak through this floor so on 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.630
 street multi someone barks at some 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.280
 Cats okay, then we put this way 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.840
 any absolutely any step that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780
 a little decorative this thing can 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.110
 put put it in a cave and long 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.180
 will be a little beautiful and advice 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.590
 nobody killed you for example like a skeleton 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.500
