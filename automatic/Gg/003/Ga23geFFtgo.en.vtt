00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.530
 what's up 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.139
 here is a mohawk and this is the skal and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.400
 modes by bringing the best modes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.949
 until disco 5 spit and I start today 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 with hatred that comes to complement other 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 molds that improve the quality of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.920
 women here on a scale and I already showed 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.040
 for you a happy customer mode that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 improves the textures showed catwalk that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.020
 she was walking more feminine, wiggling and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.540
 one to exclude that it adds new 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.030
 hair now to complement as 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.250
 You can see I'm there. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.090
 using a hotter owner this is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.360
 A normal tough of the game is the armor of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 crystal is what this template does is with 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.850
 he cut off several parts of the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 and made them more feminine, right? 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.649
 leaving much more sensual 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.070
 covers that you will use as 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.900
 common clothes and also obvious that you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 is seeing here for example scn 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.409
 surveys are wearing much more clothes 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.590
 short nÃ© 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.020
 already with those cuts that improve 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.330
 enough to immerse yourself in the game because it leaves 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.040
 women much more beautiful right 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.759
 I will show that now some 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.650
 reinforcement of the forced ferrer is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 usually called the skycar cover 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.720
 whole body and ends up not getting legal 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 for the female characters, right? 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 a negative point is that the old ladies 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.020
 right here 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.290
 I'm going to be sexy there, huh? 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 Look, lady, that old man is not wearing it anymore. 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.500
 a low-cut outfit does not stay there much 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.980
 cool, right? 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.440
 but at least your character here is going 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.390
 to be staying this way just look at this 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.530
 that neither the clothes of the coiner nor the brotherhood 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 silly dark clothing cutting and Fuck 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.149
 also has robes right here and look at this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.670
 so it leaves the attributes right. 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.390
 well more samples that improve 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.190
 much is the game in the immersion and leaves the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 women more beautiful and complements 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 other molds from which I brought another 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.630
 Nice motto that I like is the high in 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
 team and we have this template is when you 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.580
 is using for example a bow 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 whenever you change here for a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.620
 sword the arrows will continue in this 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.640
 if here as you are seeing them 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.250
 they will not continue they can see there, right? 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.320
 when I take the equipment off 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.930
 arrows man the whole sword 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.760
 just to stay with spells then this is it 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220
 that motto does it will say that it will do 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.560
 automatically arms the back here 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.820
 of the character thus leaving a visual 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.160
 more beautiful, huh? 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.110
 lots of people do this manually is not 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.070
 that come here shoot the arrow that manual 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.310
 then this mode already does it and I like it 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.190
 much because it facilitates is enough and the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.470
 work or avoid there you have stayed 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.110
 nor in the menu all the time having to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.310
 remove the machine manually then 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.200
 he already does this in another way that I 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.350
 taste good for archers is a reason 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.480
 only good this template here will do with 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.030
 that a new animation is when you are 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.000
 running with the leaving and the character 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.980
 more feminine is much more beautiful and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.430
 who aside instead of that coarse thing 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.329
 and natural sputum is the tumor can 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.760
 complementary is a template but for whom 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.190
 young archer even for those who do not play 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.230
 it will not make much difference to who 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.150
 plays the cast very well and does not play a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.640
 female archer character like me 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.850
 because it will improve the animation a little 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.250
 and making her more feminine and more real 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.220
 then to our last mode to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.310
 guys 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.980
 dies of childbirth in the ccee the look with this 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.140
 You guys are not going to need more 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.960
 choose one side between the sides of the 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.600
 blazers and the gray and 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.420
 of the dragon part max as you already know 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.820
 or imagine that you already know is in the game 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.860
 you will have to choose one 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.709
 you can not kill the harbor. 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.440
 in xxix and with that it is good to have the lawsuits 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.810
 as allies but you will lose it 's the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.960
 and who can help you 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.860
 find words that power is your 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.270
 screams 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.000
 if you choose it 's the bar side 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.010
 So you lost help from the players. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.960
 however with that motto guys goes 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:43.030
 selecting a new dialog is adept 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.680
 about max 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.890
 with that you will compel her to understand 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.450
 which is you decided to save his life and 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.330
 that they will have to obey their 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.130
 orders after all you are the dragon and Cute 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.260
 send it here in the blazers 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.880
 from then on you will have new 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.950
 of water that are added by this 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.080
 There is no speech since they were only 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.280
 added captions as you can 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.760
 see is everything translated and the link is not 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.770
 in the video description and you're going 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.110
 I can then convince dell that the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.080
 best option is that your choice of 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.300
 to save punk nacs the right choice and 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.200
 she was obliged to obey 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.070
 you are there seeing the dialogues right this 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.190
 mode 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.140
 He is very good , people who do not want 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.840
 choose one side or some 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.780
 people may find that the pee but I 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.210
 I disagree after all is milks or serve 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.780
 dragon dragon good dragon is that the leader 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.720
 says then your will must be heard 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.510
 and respected then this commodity will 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.070
 I do here think the last line 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.320
 from then on the milk will 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.660
 to agree with your decision the quest 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.300
 has been completed normally and you will 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.700
 have both the sanctions and their allies 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.500
 with the blazers 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.240
 So that's it folks this was the skal 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.120
 molds of today 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.490
