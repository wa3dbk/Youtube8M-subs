00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
gonna need to do and then you also have

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.549 
gonna need to do and then you also have
to<00:00:32.559> you<00:00:33.519> have<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:33.820> reverse<00:00:33.970> those<00:00:34.449> so<00:00:34.960> he's<00:00:35.379> got

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
to you have to reverse those so he's got

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.610 
to you have to reverse those so he's got
to<00:00:35.680> build<00:00:35.799> it<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.580> explode<00:00:37.120> in<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.559> the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
to build it to explode in the and the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
patterns that he does but also be strong

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.509

enough<00:00:40.900> to<00:00:41.019> disable<00:00:41.199> enough<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:42.220> slow<00:00:42.430> his

enough to disable enough to to slow his
body<00:00:42.699> down<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:43.540> move<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.839> opposite

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
body down and move the opposite

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.079 
body down and move the opposite
direction<00:00:44.620> that's<00:00:45.159> one<00:00:45.430> benefit<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.970> other

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
direction that's one benefit the other

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.270 
direction that's one benefit the other
is<00:00:46.330> all<00:00:46.750> functional<00:00:47.350> movements<00:00:47.680> if<00:00:47.830> you<00:00:48.070> watch

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
is all functional movements if you watch

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.430 
is all functional movements if you watch
his<00:00:48.460> feet<00:00:48.699> he's<00:00:49.089> he's<00:00:49.449> gonna<00:00:49.629> be<00:00:49.809> on<00:00:49.930> one<00:00:50.170> fit<00:00:50.409> a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
his feet he's he's gonna be on one fit a

his feet he's he's gonna be on one fit a
lot<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.949> these<00:00:51.610> drills<00:00:51.970> so<00:00:52.780> this<00:00:53.140> also<00:00:53.440> turns

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
lot in these drills so this also turns

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.490 
lot in these drills so this also turns
into<00:00:54.040> a<00:00:54.159> rehab<00:00:54.729> or<00:00:54.909> app<00:00:55.000> rehab<00:00:55.330> to<00:00:56.080> his<00:00:56.199> ankles

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
into a rehab or app rehab to his ankles

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.289 
into a rehab or app rehab to his ankles
hips<00:00:56.650> in<00:00:56.830> these<00:00:56.979> the<00:00:57.430> last<00:00:57.580> part<00:00:57.909> is<00:00:58.030> the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
hips in these the last part is the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.149 
hips in these the last part is the
explosive<00:00:59.049> nature<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.470> always<00:00:59.949> try<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
explosive nature is always try to

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.160 
explosive nature is always try to
increase<00:01:00.369> the<00:01:00.460> explosion<00:01:01.030> if<00:01:01.629> we<00:01:01.839> need<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.019> add

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
increase the explosion if we need to add

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.770 
increase the explosion if we need to add
extra<00:01:02.439> resistance<00:01:02.739> or<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.390> know<00:01:04.449> throw<00:01:04.720> a

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
extra resistance or you know throw a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.420 
extra resistance or you know throw a
band<00:01:05.019> under<00:01:05.320> his<00:01:05.409> arms<00:01:05.740> for<00:01:05.979> extra<00:01:06.220> resistance

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
band under his arms for extra resistance

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.370 
band under his arms for extra resistance
on<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.940> upper<00:01:07.120> body<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.450> can<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> straight

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
on the upper body we can so the straight

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.410 
on the upper body we can so the straight
lights<00:01:08.590> straight<00:01:09.100> left<00:01:09.370> essentially<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.240> is

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
lights straight left essentially this is

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.690 
lights straight left essentially this is
trying<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:10.960> get<00:01:11.050> his<00:01:11.200> hips<00:01:11.410> down<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.010> duck

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
trying to get his hips down and duck

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.630 
trying to get his hips down and duck
under<00:01:12.880> an<00:01:13.240> oncoming<00:01:13.690> blocker<00:01:14.290> five<00:01:15.070> reps<00:01:15.340> each

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
under an oncoming blocker five reps each

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.090 
under an oncoming blocker five reps each
arm<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.180> then<00:01:16.750> rest<00:01:17.140> recover<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:17.890> again

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
arm and then rest recover and again

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.560 
arm and then rest recover and again
we're<00:01:18.310> more<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.760> one<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.060> two<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.390> he's<00:01:19.480> gonna

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
we're more of a one to two so he's gonna

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.180 
we're more of a one to two so he's gonna
be<00:01:19.720> out<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.840> breath<00:01:19.960> so<00:01:20.290> in<00:01:20.710> time<00:01:20.860> he<00:01:20.950> gets<00:01:21.070> that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
be out of breath so in time he gets that

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.310 
be out of breath so in time he gets that
fourth<00:01:21.460> fourth<00:01:22.000> fifth<00:01:22.240> set<00:01:22.480> you<00:01:23.050> know<00:01:23.140> he's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
fourth fourth fifth set you know he's

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.840 
fourth fourth fifth set you know he's
pretty<00:01:23.470> much<00:01:23.710> toast<00:01:23.980> then<00:01:24.250> we<00:01:24.340> got<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> recovery

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
pretty much toast then we got a recovery

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.730 
pretty much toast then we got a recovery
before<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.270> do<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.780> leg<00:01:25.960> portion<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
before you do the leg portion the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.710 
before you do the leg portion the
shuffling<00:01:27.160> kicks<00:01:27.460> that's<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.910> five<00:01:28.090> yard<00:01:28.240> block

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
shuffling kicks that's a five yard block

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.800 
shuffling kicks that's a five yard block
and<00:01:29.580> essentially<00:01:30.580> it's<00:01:30.700> two<00:01:30.940> two<00:01:31.360> shuffles

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
and essentially it's two two shuffles

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020 
and essentially it's two two shuffles
kick<00:01:32.020> two<00:01:32.260> shuffles<00:01:32.650> kick<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.790> then<00:01:33.909> we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
kick two shuffles kick and then we

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.850 
kick two shuffles kick and then we
started<00:01:34.330> mixing<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.840> some<00:01:35.290> of<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.500> punches

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
started mixing in some of the punches

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.220 
started mixing in some of the punches
straight<00:01:36.159> right<00:01:36.430> straight<00:01:37.240> left<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.780> then<00:01:38.200> a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
straight right straight left and then a

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.050 
straight right straight left and then a
hook<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:39.159> there's<00:01:39.400> a<00:01:39.640> hundred<00:01:40.000> different

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
hook and there's a hundred different

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.880 
hook and there's a hundred different
patterns<00:01:40.570> he'll<00:01:40.750> do<00:01:40.870> different<00:01:41.200> ones<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.590> lot

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
patterns he'll do different ones a lot

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.890 
patterns he'll do different ones a lot
of<00:01:42.040> this<00:01:42.159> is<00:01:42.310> just<00:01:42.340> keep<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.909> very<00:01:43.120> variation

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
of this is just keep the very variation

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.200 
of this is just keep the very variation
up<00:01:44.050> will<00:01:44.470> double<00:01:44.830> up<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.159> left<00:01:45.430> double<00:01:46.150> up

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210
