00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.840
Hello! My name is Kat and today I wanna talk about my completed series!

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.300
So back in 2013, I made a video kind of like this, where I talk about all of the series I had read completely.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.720
And I think it's about time for an update!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.880
However, for this video I want to discuss not only the completed series I have read,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.600
but also the completed series that I own but have not yet finished.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.380
Right here, in this moment, I own...

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.800
SIXTY EIGHT complete series.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.460
Of these 68 series, I have read 32 of them completely

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.840
which means there are 36 series that I can complete, but I have not yet done that.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.040
But yeah, for now, I just wanted to show you guys the completed series that I own

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.460
and because there are so many of them, I should just get started already!

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.200
I'm gonna start with the series that I've already finished, and just a note, these are only series that I own

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.195
and have finished. There are some series like The Chronicles of Narnia and Animorphs that I have

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:21.575
read completely, but I don't own those books, so they're not gonna be in this video.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.720
Aside from this mention of them in this video.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.660
LET'S GO!

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.540
