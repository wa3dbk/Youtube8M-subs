you show us what what you guys are
working<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.730> ok<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:16.379> design<00:00:16.710> design<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
working on ok so we design design the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.269 
working on ok so we design design the
fly<00:00:18.060> fly<00:00:18.359> smart<00:00:18.690> wheel<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.619> only<00:00:20.010> one

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
fly fly smart wheel which is only one

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.509 
fly fly smart wheel which is only one
design<00:00:20.760> pedal<00:00:21.330> assist<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:22.320> means<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.980> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
design pedal assist that means that we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.820 
design pedal assist that means that we
have<00:00:23.550> everything<00:00:24.539> inside<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.560> motor

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
have everything inside with motor

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.800 
have everything inside with motor
battery<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> electronics<00:00:27.660> are

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
battery and all the electronics are

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
battery and all the electronics are
inside<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> rear<00:00:28.529> wheel<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.670> take

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
inside the rear wheel and you just take

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
inside the rear wheel and you just take
all<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.510> whole<00:00:30.750> wheel<00:00:30.960> off<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.830> actually

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
all the whole wheel off and it actually

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
all the whole wheel off and it actually
comes<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> whole<00:00:33.300> wheel<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.290> put<00:00:34.530> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
comes with a whole wheel and just put it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
comes with a whole wheel and just put it
on<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.610> whenever<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.180> start<00:00:36.450> pedaling

right nice ok and then also what we
designed<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> smart<00:00:46.050> light<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.980> actually

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
designed is a smart light it's actually

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.930 
designed is a smart light it's actually
analyte<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.649> phone<00:00:49.649> holder<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.579> comes<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
analyte a phone holder here comes a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
analyte a phone holder here comes a
sticky<00:00:51.270> pad<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.840> put<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.350> new

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
sticky pad you just put it like this new

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
sticky pad you just put it like this new
holes<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> bottom<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
holes and then on the bottom here you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.369 
holes and then on the bottom here you
also<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.039> USB<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.809> can
