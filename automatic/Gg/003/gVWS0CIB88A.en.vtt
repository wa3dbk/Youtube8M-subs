00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:19.560
 ironman to the doubt of the heartbreaker 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:22.270
 good is like the normals this is like 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.320
 the sea 42 can pull 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.320
 a king of fire 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.040
 like all 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.660
 it flies as everything is known 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.960
 I'm not going to have a rack and down like 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 and well we're going to mess it up I'm going to teach 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 the more or less the attacks of this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.870
 character that is very similar to iron or 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 normal 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.729

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.729
 speed of this one 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.790
 I'm in cars that go with one hand 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.190
 since the prettiest and two I think that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 burned with the chest 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.990

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.300

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.110
 and good here I leave the guide of 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.720
 characters since they are very short in 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.690
 sir the character and there are many 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.920
 well here I show you all those who 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.500
 I have now to make them 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 reviews of the characters but when 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 go get the others 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.710
 side tries to make all the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 characters that there are and good the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.170
