00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.160
 saved all the spaces rim I am doctor 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 wise we're here today with a new video 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.590
 dedicated to fifa last 15 videos a video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 particular because it is not a review 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.579
 but it's kind of a challenge we already had 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.860
 seen a duet up against put tiff 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.590
 duel learns given the cost of 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.439
 players also ok quality and here 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.090
 instead we do a duel in a bit more 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.510
 interesting because why many have 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.340
 this doubt among the wings of the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.110
 bundesliga in particular on the left a 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.960
 right we know that there is robben that a little 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.060
 the top and there is no such a player 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.370
 near robben to be able to worry him 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.990
 left instead we have two excellent 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.110
 players we have franck ribery of 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.079
 bayern monaco with evaluation 88 e 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.360
 marco reus del borussia dortmund with 86 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.070
 of evaluations so you see values 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.050
 on the card very close two players 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.540
 very strong in my opinion I was of 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.790
 reus party i was one who advised 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.200
 always royce though tried free and I have to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.820
 say that it amazed me 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.990
 start to see how you do anyway 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.930
 involve these two players 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.870
 surely year by speed like 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.630
 strong point both apparently 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.670
 ribery would seem faster but in 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.360
 reality on paper the fastest roy 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 however it certainly affects the height 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.500
 of the ribery players is lower then 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.500
 and as for me, yes it seems to run more 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.260
 fast but not so maybe it also helps 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.440
 a little bit the extra point rather two 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.890
 extra points of acceleration he has 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.390
 compared to us 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.510
 in any case, two players are very much 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.690
 very fast that put in difficulty i 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.330
 adversary fullbacks are both very 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.210
 agile this yes because they have both 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.850
 the excellent values ​​of ribery agility is 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.820
 something absurd because why 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.460
 combines control with this agility 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 ball out of the ordinary 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.200
 even 91 and ball control 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.380
 you understand a top value 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 92 trading with five steel stars 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.720
 so if you like the skill 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.330
 choice is obvious 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.970
 you have to go to franck ribery royce 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.420
 however it does not defend itself badly because 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.450
 because it has excellent agility as we have 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.910
 visa yes has a non ball control 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.130
 so exceptional because only 83 respect 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.459
 at 91 of ribery so there are as many as 8 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.430
 points of difference but a 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.140
 four star skill so you can do it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.209
 quietly all the skills you have 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.519
 serve and then to 86 of dribbling on 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.880
 card therefore not a value e 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.560
 poor indeed with regards to shooting 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.070
 here is something to say 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.870
 reus didn't score so many goals 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.880
 because he had some problems 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 maybe people didn't close it though it is 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.180
 a great hero finalizer on this 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.370
 we cannot say practically a tip 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.890
 added because with 85 of finalization 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.730
 understand that it is difficult to get under the door 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.670
 wrong 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.290
 ribery has a little less than 79 though 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.299
 I must say that it is fairly constant too 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.170
 he under the goal you see how many goals I have 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.970
 done 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.010
 and then I would like to make a small difference 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.840
 ribery I found myself better with the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.450
 precision shot then the spin shot 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.970
 maybe on the far pole 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.209
 while for royce I have to say that the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.420
 shooting power is extraordinary 85 of 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.410
 shooting power also a launch of 89 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.630
 where ribery stops at 73 so well 16 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.370
 points of difference I have to say yes 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.680
 feel if you want to entrust yourself with 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.950
 a few shots from the royce distance is the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.570
 player for you 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.489
 as far as the passage is concerned 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.630
 all two excellent players are in 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.940
 able to pass the ball very well 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.720
 so there really isn't a player who 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.820
 I prefer between the two are practically 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.130
 very similar if you need a man 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.480
 assists can do it both can 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.930
 go cross with enough 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.130
 ease year 82 royce and 83 ribery 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.400
 so you see very similar players 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.890
 the only difference over is fine we have 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.450
 given the rigors it can be a difference 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.800
 because ribery I didn't find myself that 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.790
 also good at pulling penalties to 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.140
 contrary to reus and an important thing 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.360
 in the punishments are two players 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.920
 fantastic have two types of editions 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.080
 different because I don't like the so much 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.090
 movement that makes ribery and I prefer 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.850
 what marco reus does, however, are two 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.950
 players that really from the punishment 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.660
 therefore they can be a sentence 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.420
 learn to take punishment because with 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.550
 these players can enjoy you 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.460
 the only substantial difference is really 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.410
 what is very noticeable is one that 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.140
 it is not a card statistic but 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.410
 but at the price because royce I speak of 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.250
 xbox prices cost around 70,000 credits 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.160
 when ribery costs 320,000 click 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.510
 so understand that there is a very big one 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.390
 difference more than 200,000 credits of 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.540
 difference and I think it is a bit 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:11.090
 unjustified for what I think 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.970
 are two players that if we don't watch 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.890
 the price is very very similar 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.940
 preference for free because you love 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.070
 very agile low players good at doing 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.380
 the skins a bit like neymar to make us a 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.620
 example royce a player in a bit more 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.470
 physical with much more physical strength than 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.600
 what is shown on paper though 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.430
 are two very valid players however with 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.430
 this price difference is 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.260
 really really high I recommend to 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.440
 one hundred percent marco reus and therefore it is 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.470
 he the winner of this challenge between two 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.360
 incredible stars and the only two 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.720
 level name choices for 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.270
 external claims in a bundesliga 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.770
 you can use them both as well 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.169
 external yes maybe 4 4 2 a lot 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.180
 offensive damage 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.620
 better in my opinion in 4 2 3 1 than later 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.300
 in the position where they play in the 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.509
 actually they are sinister 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.249
 or as or as or ats tell me a little then 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.680
 which other players we have to put in 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:11.310
 compare we will see you soon 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.310
 Hi everyone
