significant drop off and you'll start to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.249 
significant drop off and you'll start to
notice<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.390> quickly<00:01:48.689> actually

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
notice it really quickly actually

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.109 
notice it really quickly actually
probably<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:49.770> 200<00:01:50.670> meter<00:01:50.820> plus

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
engagements so you'll start half you'll

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.510

start<00:01:53.790> having<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.720> try<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> compensate<00:01:56.130> for

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
zeroing of the scope system which a lot

zeroing of the scope system which a lot
of<00:02:00.149> people<00:02:00.450> I've<00:02:00.619> noticed<00:02:01.619> tend<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
of people I've noticed tend to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.520 
of people I've noticed tend to
completely<00:02:02.700> skip<00:02:03.090> over<00:02:03.509> except<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.409> they're

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
completely skip over except if they're

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
completely skip over except if they're
going<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.890> longer<00:02:05.250> shots

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
going for longer shots

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.070 
going for longer shots
but<00:02:07.260> yeah<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:08.399> should<00:02:09.300> immediately<00:02:09.840> tell

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
but yeah that should immediately tell

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.660 
but yeah that should immediately tell
you<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.500> guns<00:02:10.740> probably<00:02:11.160> more

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
you that this guns probably more

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.630 
you that this guns probably more
favorable<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.170> pretty<00:02:13.530> good<00:02:13.800> fire<00:02:14.340> rate

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
favorable with the pretty good fire rate

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.400 
favorable with the pretty good fire rate
on<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.540> fact<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> bullet<00:02:16.290> drop

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
on it and the fact that the bullet drop

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.559 
on it and the fact that the bullet drop
is<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.709> highest<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.340> gun<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> quite<00:02:18.090> good<00:02:18.360> in

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
is the highest this gun is quite good in

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.600 
is the highest this gun is quite good in
medium<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.050> short-range<00:02:19.709> aggressive<00:02:20.400> recon

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
medium and short-range aggressive recon

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.820 
medium and short-range aggressive recon
encounters<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:22.140> would<00:02:22.319> probably<00:02:22.500> be

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
encounters and that would probably be

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.820 
encounters and that would probably be
its<00:02:23.730> biggest<00:02:24.180> strength<00:02:24.510> especially<00:02:25.410> with<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
its biggest strength especially with the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.530 
its biggest strength especially with the
magazine<00:02:26.220> size<00:02:26.400> which<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.819> really<00:02:27.209> good<00:02:27.390> with

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
magazine size which is really good with

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.680 
magazine size which is really good with
11<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> projectile<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.910> fires<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.450> course

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
11 and the projectile it fires of course

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.910 
11 and the projectile it fires of course
is<00:02:30.930> 7.62<00:02:31.800> by<00:02:31.890> 54r<00:02:32.580> millimeter<00:02:33.000> bolt<00:02:33.330> round

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
is 7.62 by 54r millimeter bolt round

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.940 
is 7.62 by 54r millimeter bolt round
reload<00:02:34.920> time<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.190> 4.7<00:02:36.090> seconds<00:02:36.420> when<00:02:36.600> empty

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
reload time is 4.7 seconds when empty

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.009

2.9<00:02:37.950> seconds<00:02:38.580> when<00:02:39.300> there's<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.540> round<00:02:39.720> left<00:02:39.870> in

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
2.9 seconds when there's a round left in

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.050 
2.9 seconds when there's a round left in
the<00:02:40.080> chamber<00:02:40.140> which<00:02:40.680> again<00:02:41.130> isn't<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.730> great

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the chamber which again isn't that great

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.870 
the chamber which again isn't that great
but<00:02:42.330> it's<00:02:42.720> acceptable<00:02:43.380> because<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
but it's acceptable because the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.100 
but it's acceptable because the
difference<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.330> between<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.690> lot<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
difference is between a lot of the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.259 
difference is between a lot of the
bolt-action<00:02:46.470> rifles<00:02:47.069> are<00:02:47.160> only<00:02:47.340> maybe<00:02:47.519> 0.2<00:02:48.090> or

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
bolt-action rifles are only maybe 0.2 or

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.720 
bolt-action rifles are only maybe 0.2 or
0.3<00:02:48.750> seconds<00:02:49.200> which<00:02:49.950> isn't<00:02:50.130> enough<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
0.3 seconds which isn't enough to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.180 
0.3 seconds which isn't enough to
actually<00:02:51.180> completely<00:02:51.900> demote<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.350> gun<00:02:52.650> from

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
actually completely demote a gun from

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.850 
actually completely demote a gun from
its<00:02:53.370> regular<00:02:53.550> usage<00:02:54.420> well<00:02:55.350> at<00:02:55.410> least<00:02:55.560> not<00:02:55.709> for

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
its regular usage well at least not for

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.300 
its regular usage well at least not for
me<00:02:55.980> maybe<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.489> for<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:57.920> again<00:02:58.920> you'll<00:02:59.069> see

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
me maybe it is for you again you'll see

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.370 
me maybe it is for you again you'll see
though<00:02:59.489> with<00:03:00.209> regard<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.810> gun<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.080> it's

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
though with regard to this gun that it's

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.170 
though with regard to this gun that it's
not<00:03:01.560> very<00:03:01.799> different<00:03:02.130> from<00:03:02.310> battlefield<00:03:02.850> 3<00:03:03.090> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
not very different from battlefield 3 it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.910 
not very different from battlefield 3 it
was<00:03:03.239> quite<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.870> medium<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.410> short<00:03:04.440> range

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
was quite good in medium and short range

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.520 
was quite good in medium and short range
encounters<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:06.660> that's<00:03:06.810> where<00:03:06.959> it's<00:03:07.080> its

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
encounters but that's where it's its

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.410 
encounters but that's where it's its
strength<00:03:07.920> lies<00:03:08.280> you'll<00:03:08.760> see<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.269> lot<00:03:09.360> of

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
strength lies you'll see it in a lot of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.630 
strength lies you'll see it in a lot of
the<00:03:09.600> highlights<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> background

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
the highlights here in the background

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.009 
the highlights here in the background
the<00:03:11.640> fact<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.239> cycle<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.600> bolt<00:03:12.720> so

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
the fact that you can cycle the bolt so

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.630 
the fact that you can cycle the bolt so
quickly<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.560> still<00:03:13.769> get<00:03:13.920> quite<00:03:14.160> effective

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
quickly and still get quite effective

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.460 
quickly and still get quite effective
kills<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.390> give<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.810> its<00:03:15.959> strength<00:03:16.079> in

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
kills with it give it its strength in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.560 
kills with it give it its strength in
short<00:03:16.739> range<00:03:16.920> encounters<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:18.090> unless<00:03:18.390> you're

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
short range encounters but unless you're

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.030 
short range encounters but unless you're
