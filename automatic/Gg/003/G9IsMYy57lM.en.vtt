00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 Hello dear Today I'm doing a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.809
 liqueur does not only fit to easter 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:22.220
 also fits the front of the holiday season 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.220
 what we need for this are ten yolks 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.029
 you should not throw it at it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.029
 but that is still 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.620
 I'll do that a little bit more now 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.620
 continue 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.579
 We still need cores 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:05.580
 then pay 200 milliliters then 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:11.550
 icing sugar about 150 grams and that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.280
 I have measured half liter around and 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.890
 besides, we need two more 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.369
 vanilla pods for that will be 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.460
 then you can cut the mark 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460
 scrape out 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.640
 that can already go to the bavaria 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.799
 be given because it belongs anyway 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:48.300
 the pods will need it themselves 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:52.240
 Then we also get the pods 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.670
 Immediately then in the pot with the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.640
 you will see soon 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:04.510
 Here I have a pot of water and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:09.100
 one another on top of it a 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:14.890
 So I can do that in another pot 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.840
 request water bath and that should be the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.640
 temperature but not too high otherwise 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.090
 the money immediately clots and that one was 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.090
 yes not either 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:41.120
 in this pot we give now and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:44.540
 So dive for one and our 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 also like the vanilla sput and that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.740
 you like him then comes to the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.740
 powdered sugar 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.890
 the whole thing is stirred smoothly 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.680
 so come now 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.680
 all of them 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:05.019
 you will notice after a while 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 that it starts the mass a little bit 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.140
 stock up 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:19.989
 and that is the time or rum 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:25.889
 this comes about after about ten fifteen 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:28.389
 minutes felt is much longer 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:34.240
 really nice consistency achieved 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:38.070
 You can see that too 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.070
 vanilla pods are taken out 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:49.610
 because you do not want later in 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:49.610
 our reporter have really tasty 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.770
 and now it will 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.590
 slowly 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:13.770
 so rum does not stir up 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.770
 once 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.270
 Now the AllgÃ¤u is finished and can 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.110
 it is best to take them 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.110
 and judge 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:37.090
 it does not laugh why I have such a small one 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:40.480
 trowel that fits best in the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.480
 all be here 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:53.570
 the egg liqueur must be cool so im 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.010
 fridge and parents 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.700
 good question i have in many recipes 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.080
 seen and read 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.080
 there are two weeks specified 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.910
 some of the cows manufacturers say so 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.970
 gets closed like egg liqueur like that 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.850
 bought gets locked about 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.130
 a year and half a year 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.250
 a fridge 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.200
 I think it's mostly for the time being 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.550
 weather not so old because you have 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.020
 seen how fast that is itself 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.690
 which one to do and the other is 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:40.290
 so much strong alcohol there if 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:41.820
 because the um has 38 percent that 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.880
 I actually assume that he 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.050
 already some time lasts longer than two 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.050
 but try it out 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.210
 so now I have the first one 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:01.230
 bottle bottled she has to enter now 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.230
 to be cleaned up a bit 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.500
 yes that was our made egg liqueur 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.930
 I hope he tastes just as good 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.090
 for us and we may join 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.380
 one of the next videos i would be 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.530
 happy if you subscribe to my channel 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.530
 until then
