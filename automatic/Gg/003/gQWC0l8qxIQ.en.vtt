commentating guy was pretty irritating

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.570 
commentating guy was pretty irritating
because<00:02:09.300> he<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.959> don't<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:11.280> link<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the videos in the description I put a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
the videos in the description I put a
little<00:02:13.410> bit<00:02:13.530> of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
little bit of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.119 
little bit of
game<00:02:13.989> here<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.319> here<00:02:14.349> just<00:02:14.650> because<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.010> know

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
one more thing i think that the Cabal i

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.350 
one more thing i think that the Cabal i
think<00:02:20.980> they're<00:02:21.099> called<00:02:21.129> i<00:02:21.459> was<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.819> bit<00:02:22.090> like

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
think they're called i was a bit like

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.990 
think they're called i was a bit like
kind<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:22.810> what<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.459> guy<00:02:24.640> kills

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
kind of like what because this guy kills

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.520 
kind of like what because this guy kills
them<00:02:25.239> like<00:02:25.390> really<00:02:25.840> quickly<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.410> his

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
them like really quickly with his

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.619 
them like really quickly with his
assault<00:02:26.890> rifle<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.940> don't<00:02:28.239> know<00:02:28.330> they

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
assault rifle and I I don't know they

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.640 
assault rifle and I I don't know they
look<00:02:28.750> as<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:28.930> they<00:02:29.050> could<00:02:29.260> take<00:02:29.379> a<00:02:29.410> lot<00:02:29.620> more

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
look as if they could take a lot more

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.710 
look as if they could take a lot more
punishment<00:02:30.010> than<00:02:30.129> that<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:31.299> kind<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.599> know

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
punishment than that and it kind of know

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.030 
punishment than that and it kind of know
it<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.080> had<00:02:32.200> irritated<00:02:32.620> me<00:02:32.799> because<00:02:32.980> I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
it kind of had irritated me because I

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.860 
it kind of had irritated me because I
thought<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.430> know<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.819> i<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.540> liked<00:02:34.750> it

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
thought you know I i would have liked it

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.180 
thought you know I i would have liked it
if<00:02:34.989> these<00:02:35.200> guys<00:02:35.379> could<00:02:35.620> put<00:02:35.799> up<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> little<00:02:36.099> bit

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
if these guys could put up a little bit

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.500 
if these guys could put up a little bit
more<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.459> fight<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.819> then<00:02:36.879> i<00:02:36.970> guess<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.269> hard

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
more of a fight and then i guess is hard

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.729 
more of a fight and then i guess is hard
difficulty<00:02:38.049> which<00:02:38.170> probably<00:02:38.349> makes<00:02:38.560> them<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
difficulty which probably makes them a

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.710 
difficulty which probably makes them a
little<00:02:38.769> harder<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.250> fight<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:40.269> i<00:02:40.480> don't<00:02:40.690> know

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
little harder to fight but i don't know

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.360 
little harder to fight but i don't know
i<00:02:40.810> think<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.530> should<00:02:41.560> take<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.099> lot<00:02:42.340> more

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
i think that they should take a lot more

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.550 
i think that they should take a lot more
bullets<00:02:42.819> than<00:02:42.879> that<00:02:43.180> because<00:02:43.420> i<00:02:43.989> don't<00:02:44.500> know

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
bullets than that because i don't know

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.199 
bullets than that because i don't know
it<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.860> almost<00:02:45.010> seems<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.459> bit<00:02:45.580> too<00:02:45.760> easy<00:02:45.940> oh

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
it it almost seems a bit too easy oh

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.390 
it it almost seems a bit too easy oh
well<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.870> know<00:02:46.900> that's<00:02:47.440> what<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:48.040> so
