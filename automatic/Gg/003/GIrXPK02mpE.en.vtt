stupid<00:00:43.420> thing<00:00:43.570> it's<00:00:44.140> all<00:00:44.260> I'm<00:00:44.350> gonna<00:00:44.440> take

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
stupid thing it's all I'm gonna take

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.420 
stupid thing it's all I'm gonna take
though<00:00:45.600> let's<00:00:46.600> see<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:46.809> shaved<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.469> all<00:00:48.039> the<00:00:48.340> way

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
though let's see I shaved it all the way

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
though let's see I shaved it all the way
to<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.210> transmission<00:00:49.660> box<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:52.180> there<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to the transmission box right there and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920 
to the transmission box right there and
when<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.140> is<00:00:56.289> closed<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:58.090> transmission<00:00:58.660> box

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
when this is closed the transmission box

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.380 
when this is closed the transmission box
is<00:00:59.230> pretty<00:01:00.010> sealed<00:01:00.340> up<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:00.550> it's<00:01:00.910> not<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.120> deal

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
is pretty sealed up so it's not a deal

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.029 
is pretty sealed up so it's not a deal
it's<00:01:01.629> kind<00:01:02.199> of<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.350> win-lose<00:01:02.769> situation

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
it's kind of a win-lose situation

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.220 
it's kind of a win-lose situation
because<00:01:03.820> it's<00:01:04.059> easier<00:01:04.450> to<00:01:04.510> clean<00:01:04.690> but<00:01:05.110> it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
because it's easier to clean but it's

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.650 
because it's easier to clean but it's
also<00:01:05.380> easier<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:05.860> get<00:01:06.040> dirty

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
also easier to get dirty

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.740 
also easier to get dirty
other<00:01:08.350> than<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.950> just<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.570> know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
other than that I just you know

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.620 
other than that I just you know
chopped<00:01:11.050> holes<00:01:11.350> there<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.460> topped<00:01:13.390> off<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
chopped holes there I topped off the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.180 
chopped holes there I topped off the
centerpiece<00:01:14.410> here<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.920> would<00:01:15.130> have

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
centerpiece here that would have

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.740 
centerpiece here that would have
connected<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.880> main<00:01:16.090> chassis<00:01:16.360> because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
connected it to the main chassis because

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.490 
connected it to the main chassis because
I<00:01:16.870> don't<00:01:17.050> use<00:01:17.260> that<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.320> last

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
I don't use that and that's it the last

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.660 
I don't use that and that's it the last
thing<00:01:20.680> I'll<00:01:20.800> say<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:21.010> that<00:01:21.130> don't<00:01:21.520> ever

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
I just can't say enough about it but

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.760 
I just can't say enough about it but
anyways<00:02:12.210> just<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.270> little<00:02:13.450> underpowered<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.260> got

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
anyways just a little underpowered I got

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.260 
anyways just a little underpowered I got
some<00:02:14.980> tubing<00:02:15.580> I'll<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.910> doing<00:02:16.180> some<00:02:16.480> new

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
some tubing I'll be doing some new

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.690 
some tubing I'll be doing some new
bumpers<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:20.010> you'll<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.430> truck

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
bumpers and you'll see this truck

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.000 
bumpers and you'll see this truck
transform<00:02:22.360> awfully<00:02:23.200> quick<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:23.740> as<00:02:23.890> soon

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
transform awfully quick and then as soon

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.770 
transform awfully quick and then as soon
as<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.220> fry<00:02:24.460> something<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.060> I'll<00:02:25.510> put<00:02:25.750> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
as I fry something like I'll put a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
as I fry something like I'll put a
better<00:02:26.020> ESC<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.820> better<00:02:27.820> steering<00:02:28.150> servo<00:02:28.600> and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
better ESC and better steering servo and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.340 
better ESC and better steering servo and
one<00:02:31.120> thing<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.330> didn't<00:02:31.540> mention<00:02:31.570> is<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.990> had<00:02:32.260> to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
one thing I didn't mention is I had to

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.890 
one thing I didn't mention is I had to
take<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.310> automatic<00:02:34.060> centering<00:02:35.460> deal<00:02:36.900> recent

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
take the automatic centering deal recent

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.970 
take the automatic centering deal recent
raise<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.200> wheels<00:02:38.410> after<00:02:38.650> you're<00:02:38.890> done

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
raise the wheels after you're done

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.360 
raise the wheels after you're done
steering<00:02:39.400> I'd<00:02:39.970> take<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.390> off<00:02:41.070> there's<00:02:42.070> a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
steering I'd take that off there's a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.600 
steering I'd take that off there's a
little<00:02:42.670> notch<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.670> steering<00:02:46.510> bar<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
little notch on the steering bar that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.130 
little notch on the steering bar that
that<00:02:48.760> will<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.210> come<00:02:49.390> off<00:02:49.420> if<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.810> keep<00:02:50.020> it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
that will have to come off if I keep it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.140 
that will have to come off if I keep it
but<00:02:50.320> I'm<00:02:50.560> probably<00:02:50.740> just<00:02:50.920> gonna<00:02:51.130> since<00:02:52.030> this

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
but I'm probably just gonna since this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.670 
but I'm probably just gonna since this
is<00:02:52.330> straight<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.020> has<00:02:53.170> holes<00:02:53.470> on

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
is straight and it just has holes on

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.040 
is straight and it just has holes on
each<00:02:53.830> end<00:02:54.210> I'm<00:02:55.210> just<00:02:55.420> gonna<00:02:55.510> make<00:02:55.690> one<00:02:55.750> out<00:02:55.930> of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
each end I'm just gonna make one out of

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.710 
each end I'm just gonna make one out of
aluminum<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.740> have<00:02:56.890> an<00:02:57.010> aluminum<00:02:57.720> steering

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
aluminum and have an aluminum steering

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.680 
aluminum and have an aluminum steering
rod<00:02:59.040> so<00:03:00.040> anyways<00:03:00.310> that's<00:03:00.490> part<00:03:01.090> two<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.480> your

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
rod so anyways that's part two of your

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.270 
rod so anyways that's part two of your
crazy<00:03:02.020> mouth<00:03:02.350> spell<00:03:02.530> rock<00:03:02.680> crawlers<00:03:03.040> if<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
crazy mouth spell rock crawlers if you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.060 
crazy mouth spell rock crawlers if you
made<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:03.640> far<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.650> last<00:03:05.860> things

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
made it this far one of the last things

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.470 
made it this far one of the last things
I'll<00:03:06.220> be<00:03:06.340> doing<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.670> four-wheel<00:03:07.120> steering

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
I'll be doing is four-wheel steering

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.180 
I'll be doing is four-wheel steering
because<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.440> seems<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> front

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
because it seems like the front

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.010 
because it seems like the front
transmission<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> lot<00:03:10.240> stronger<00:03:10.570> than<00:03:10.780> the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
transmission is a lot stronger than the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.470 
transmission is a lot stronger than the
back<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.560> don't<00:03:12.160> know<00:03:12.220> why<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.150> I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
back I don't know why that is it just I

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.130 
back I don't know why that is it just I
know<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.970> anyways<00:03:15.970> uh<00:03:16.000> look<00:03:16.750> out<00:03:16.870> for<00:03:17.050> my

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
know it is so anyways uh look out for my

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.100 
know it is so anyways uh look out for my
next<00:03:17.200> video<00:03:17.470> part<00:03:17.890> three
