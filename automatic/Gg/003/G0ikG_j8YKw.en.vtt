 they are linked by a neuronal bridge 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 but even the higher ones are 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.250
 proving to be weak in the face of the threat 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.320
 of those on the verge of defeat 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.570

 unlikely heroes a failed former 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.739

 robots have to be driven 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.900
 by two people and despite talking 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.519
 different languages the two are 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.800
 matched to follow the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.200
 Pentecostal stake instructions 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.540

 find the origin of the monsters 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.290
 Guillermo del Toro explained that he has 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.690
 wanted to gather an international cast 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.970
 so that no country in particular 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.250
 was the one that would finally save the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.670
 land and that they were represented 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.040
 this way all races and creeds 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.200
 keep commenting that they designed 6 higher 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.329
 the robots and they are in the movie of 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.519
 one way or another although four of them 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.940
 will be those who have more presence and who 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.349
 are those of Russian nationality 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.180
 North American and Australian 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.459
 those monsters has declared that 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.799
 they designed ten of the monsters but they did not 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.769
 they all appear only eight of 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.510
 they wanted specifically that there 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.489
 Chinese robots because he liked 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.950
 aesthetically see a night battle 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.260
 of these lit by neon lights 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.120
 of Hong Kong under the rain because it is 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.270
 one of the last strongholds of the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.160
 human resistance in this regard and 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.560
 commented on several occasions that he has 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.930
 used robots and monsters to size 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.730
 real and that has hardly used effects 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.350
 digital for the production of 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.210
 movie so they have come up 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.370
 problems when shooting in 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.490
 certain sets by the size of the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.500
 creatures that appear the size is what 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.690
 that led him to decide not to shoot 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.420
 the movie in 3-d n and turn it into 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.580
 postproduction ends by stating that the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.740
 movie will have little more than two hours and 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.990
 that there are 30 minutes of deleted scenes 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.970
 that will appear in the blu ray according to 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.040
 words of the own guillermo del toro 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.350
 this will be the movie with the best 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.330
 fucking monsters that we've seen in the 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.820

 the cream model are types if these are 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.470
 all the harrier of the movie other 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.960
 point that is the one that judges son is a 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.510
 Japanese word that means beast 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.910
 strange but usually in English it 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.220
 use as a monster we could say 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.810
 which is a subgenre or a style within 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.390
 of the 'other' kusatsu that comes to 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.820
 mean special effects the most 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.130
 of viewers of the world will already know 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.590
 either because they are fans have seen some

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.020
 simply from hearsay characters there 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.270
 hun as bot chair and camera and robots 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.250
 of great proportions that fights against 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.670
 1000 and an enemy if between them 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.220
 monsters well now I conclude with the 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.800
