in 2010-2011 all right next up what we
have<00:01:10.800> is<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.640> Manute<00:01:11.970> 350<00:01:12.960> essentially

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
have is the the Manute 350 essentially

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.220 
have is the the Manute 350 essentially
the<00:01:14.700> minus<00:01:15.180> 350<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.110> the

fourth generation of the original minus
that<00:01:19.810> we<00:01:20.050> viewed<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.620> four<00:01:21.100> years<00:01:21.280> ago

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
that we viewed it four years ago

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.640 
that we viewed it four years ago
original<00:01:22.300> one<00:01:22.480> coming<00:01:22.810> out<00:01:22.900> with<00:01:23.020> 70<00:01:23.320> lumens

original one coming out with 70 lumens

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.590 
original one coming out with 70 lumens
we've<00:01:23.800> actually<00:01:23.980> now<00:01:24.310> got<00:01:24.910> a<00:01:25.080> 350<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:28.180> now<00:01:28.360> has

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
we've actually now got a 350 it now has

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.270 
we've actually now got a 350 it now has
three<00:01:28.960> light<00:01:29.170> levels<00:01:29.560> high<00:01:29.710> medium<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.190> low

three light levels high medium and low
plus<00:01:30.730> flash<00:01:31.060> instead<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.630> last<00:01:31.870> year<00:01:32.080> just

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
plus flash instead of last year just

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.830 
plus flash instead of last year just
have<00:01:32.410> an<00:01:32.530> eye<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.010> low<00:01:33.480> one<00:01:34.480> of<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.660> big

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
have an eye and low one of the big

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.500 
have an eye and low one of the big
differences<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.530> really<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.980> first<00:01:36.520> for<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
differences and really a first for the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.570 
differences and really a first for the
industry<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.110> compact<00:01:38.530> lighting<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.340> that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
industry of a compact lighting is that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.490 
industry of a compact lighting is that
we've<00:01:39.760> actually<00:01:39.940> introduced<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.720> multi-chip

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
we've actually introduced the multi-chip

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.280 
we've actually introduced the multi-chip
LED<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.790> what<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:42.970> means<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.900> led

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
LED so what that means is that this led

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.460 
LED so what that means is that this led
usually<00:01:44.650> reserved<00:01:44.950> for<00:01:45.900> more<00:01:46.900> powerful

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
usually reserved for more powerful

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.800 
usually reserved for more powerful
lights<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:48.010> maybe<00:01:48.520> did<00:01:48.850> six<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.540> seven

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
lights that maybe did six to seven

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.000 
lights that maybe did six to seven
hundred<00:01:49.840> lumens<00:01:50.140> what<00:01:50.500> we're<00:01:50.620> doing<00:01:50.800> is<00:01:50.890> we've

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
hundred lumens what we're doing is we've

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.860 
hundred lumens what we're doing is we've
incorporated<00:01:51.280> into<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:51.880> much<00:01:52.090> smaller<00:01:52.360> package

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
incorporated into a much smaller package

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.450 
incorporated into a much smaller package
we're<00:01:53.560> able<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.860> get<00:01:54.270> 350<00:01:55.270> lumens<00:01:56.310> retail<00:01:57.310> on

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
we're able to get 350 lumens retail on

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.510 
we're able to get 350 lumens retail on
this<00:01:57.490> will<00:01:57.940> actually<00:01:58.120> stay<00:01:58.540> at<00:01:58.890> 199<00:01:59.890> same<00:02:00.280> as

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
this will actually stay at 199 same as

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.010 
this will actually stay at 199 same as
the<00:02:00.730> new<00:02:01.450> 200<00:02:02.490> next<00:02:03.490> up<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.060> have<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.210> new

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
the new 200 next up you have the new

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.100 
the new 200 next up you have the new
dual<00:02:05.490> 700<00:02:06.490> essentially<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.720> buell

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
dual 700 essentially it's the buell

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.530 
dual 700 essentially it's the buell
version<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.619> 350<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.000> get<00:02:10.149> now<00:02:10.390> you've

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
version of the 350 so you get now you've

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.160 
version of the 350 so you get now you've
got<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.840> light<00:02:11.110> head<00:02:11.790> each<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:13.060> each<00:02:13.300> producing

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
that basically said is that it had to be

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.370 
that basically said is that it had to be
