00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.310
 hello together in this video it works 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.600
 symmetrical training and so on 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.990
 metric exercises 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.270
 This is the product 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.119
 on the subject of power gain in the pectoris 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.650
 Mario Biceps speaks conti himself 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.650
 through symmetrical training 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.539
 the symmetric training or too 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.579
 strictly speaking, one is 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.589
 Training method in not having it 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.079
 a visible contraction or 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.899
 Stretching of the muscle comes in comparison 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.210
 to positive or negative dynamic 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.460
 training where this is the case comes 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.170
 in isometric training only too much 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.719
 high voltage developments 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.210
 therefore, this training should never be 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.219
 Improvement of power or strength 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.949
 Endurance or maximum strength 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.890
 to be applied when doing this 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.970
 training but with a subsequent 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.190
 eccentric or concentric 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.740
 training is connected this is 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.740
 Training method highly effective 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.750
 that has symmetrical training 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.479
 many advantages the execution of this 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.420
 very simply does not drink any devices 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.909
 necessary though the Sunni 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.549
 training is time-saving it has one 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.159
 very high training effectiveness in 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.939
 a short time are high force to change 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 reachable 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.369
 this team is in rehabilitation 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.740
 ideally suited another 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.289
 advantage is that this training is not 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.390
 is bound to a fixed place and you 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.820
 This training is always and everywhere 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 can feel through and this training 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.530
 also brings no costs 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.800
 the symmetrical training also has 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.790
 Pauli, for example, the coordination in 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.220
 the background 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.030
 the monotony of this workout is too 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.000
 no disadvantage 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.270
 to support the power because at 1 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.460
 company design way that I am so with 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.530
 the level reached is stabilized 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.620
 and a so-called maximum force 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.870
 Barrier entrance another disadvantage 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.810
 is that the symmetrical training 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.670
 This is why breathing often feels too pes 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.130
 Should the training be with younger or 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.130
 older generations 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.510
 This is an exercise for the offers 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.610
 ourselves and for the triceps we do 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.130
 with both hands a fist and think 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.020
 the left fist on the right fist with 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.290
 the left fist press down 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.580
 middle bill upwards 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.950
 this exercise for him as well as for ten 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.950
 for seconds very intensively 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.770
 in the left arm as in this exercise the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.700
 Triceps while smiling the biceps 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.430
 claimed 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.910
 Now if we reverse this exercise by 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.490
 feel 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.560
 So if we go up with the regulator 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.210
 press down with the right arm 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.300
 then not the left biceps and the 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.740
 smile at the kita claim this too 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.740
 Exercise for ten seconds 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.239
 This is an exercise for the text 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.459
 So for the big breast muscle we 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.290
 put the handy ones on each other and so 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.049
 stretch your arms forward 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.510
 it is important in doing a straight 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.950
 to turn back 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.549
 We now press the palms 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.530
 against each other 14 seconds 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.349
 who still save the breast ? 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:15.079
 should do that so that he can feel the tension 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:17.810
 so will be received after these ten seconds 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.459
 we change the hand break and run 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.150
 this exercise again for ten seconds 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.150
 by 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:36.069
 This is an exercise for the job 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.110
 muscles we do with your hands 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.419
 one almost and when the two fists 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.699
 between the thighs with the 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.470
 thighs we think inside 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.720
 the two fists to the outside 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.130
 It is important to have a straight line 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.259
 to have back and the top two 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.870
 be a bit whole body 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.620
 We perform this exercise for ten seconds 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.620
 by 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.720
 This is an exercise for the biceps 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.600
 families and for the museum maximus us 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.000
 Put it on the floor and stretch it 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.260
 Body straight through with the verses 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.640
 allowed to go vertically into the ground 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.710
 if we stretch the body through 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.320
 exciting as the po in addition to 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.320
 this exercise feel like by 14 seconds 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.830
 we will play that pc sp 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.190
 moody's and theos maximus enabled 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.190
 become
