00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
definitely like a warm black color but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.729 
definitely like a warm black color but
it's<00:02:24.849> just<00:02:25.150> never<00:02:25.900> seen<00:02:26.170> anything<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.590> it

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
it's just never seen anything like it

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.069 
it's just never seen anything like it
before<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> was<00:02:28.299> really<00:02:28.450> excited<00:02:28.629> about

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
before so I was really excited about

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.440 
before so I was really excited about
that<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.459> also<00:02:30.610> gives<00:02:30.879> really<00:02:31.239> nice

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
that and then it also gives really nice

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.020 
that and then it also gives really nice
matte<00:02:32.319> colors<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.400> matte<00:02:33.670> ones<00:02:33.879> are

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
matte colors so the matte ones are

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.050 
matte colors so the matte ones are
strange<00:02:34.420> element<00:02:35.079> nooner<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.709> dark<00:02:36.370> side<00:02:36.730> and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
strange element nooner and dark side and

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.420 
strange element nooner and dark side and
then<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> gives<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.840> good<00:02:38.019> like<00:02:38.560> from<00:02:38.920> light<00:02:39.190> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
then it gives a good like from light to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.330 
then it gives a good like from light to
dark<00:02:39.700> mixture<00:02:40.659> which<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.440> really<00:02:41.769> appreciate

what I have to go back into many go to

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.530 
what I have to go back into many go to
palette<00:03:09.159> or<00:03:09.340> my<00:03:09.459> naked<00:03:09.730> 1<00:03:09.879> palette<00:03:09.909> and<00:03:10.359> use

those<00:03:10.750> colors<00:03:11.159> for<00:03:12.159> highlighting<00:03:12.549> so<00:03:13.000> it

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
those colors for highlighting so it

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.059 
those colors for highlighting so it
