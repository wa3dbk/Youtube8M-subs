00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.910
 welcome to part 2 of medical rim 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.709
 the next metal that we will treat is arsenic 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.640
 Arsenic is found in cigarette smoke, laundry detergents, beer 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.640
 Giz seafood is wine and drinking water 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.060
 so we are exposed to this poison in the first 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.640
 and second hand of smoke when breathing 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 the drinks we drink and also the clothes we wear accumulates in the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.760
 kidneys and liver and lungs 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.360
 ton of head hunters mental confusion and fatigue 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.330
 the next metal we will discuss derision 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.340
 reeds found in soda smoke cigars water softeners July 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.280
 motor oil pesticides fungicides antioxidant carpets 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.740
 polishing silver and plastics 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.490
 Cadmium accumulates prostate kidneys and eyes 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.120
 can cause fatigue high blood pressure hair loss the martÃ­ 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.380
 I wanted and impotence 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.790
 the last of the toxic metals that we will discuss the south year 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.390
 Uranium is a radioactive element that cash diseases and cancer wherever you want 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.650
 that go 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.360
 there have been more than 2000 nuclear detonations on our planet 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 tell you lime 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.940
 each - sending radioactive dust into the atmosphere to be breathed by the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.560
 future generations 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.760
 to say nothing of 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.479
 the Chernobyl disaster 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.700
 in ukraine and that of the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.020
 Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.750
 U.S 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.170
 the most recent use of uranium was the Iraq war 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.760
 until now they are estimated 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.870
 Two thousand tons of uranium used in Iraq 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.560
 making of that country 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.440
 a true radioactive nightmare 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.830
 that future generations will pay with free birth defects and 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.580
 Cancer 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.420
 American soldiers 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.180
 they are also breathing this uranium powder and bringing it back to their 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 families 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 in their bodies and clothes 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.470
 the increase in the number of birth defects found in children of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.229
 the war veterans in iraq 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.099
 it is frightening 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.799
 we do not need to be in Iraq 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.230
 however we are exposed to the effects of this uranium powder 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.680
 the uranium that was used in Iraq 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.099
 travels like toxic dust around the world 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 and county time reaches our lungs 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.609
 the truth of this is 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.449
 that no matter where we live he knew what we do 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.629
 if we breathe air 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.559
 we owe water and obviously eat 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.760
 we are exposed to toxic metals 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.559
 all the time 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.979
 since a toxic metal enters our body it is very difficult to get it through 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.669
 this is 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.669
 because the toxic metals are not just floating around the torrent 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.269
 blood is 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.939
 or sitting on the fatty tissues their 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.419
 they really 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.099
 they become part of our bodies at a cellular level 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.489
 this happens 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.180
 because for the body toxic metals look like other elements 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.579
 elements that we need 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.149
 this is due to the similarity of being immediate mika 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.559
 and configure it 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.689
 in merida tonic and with electron figuration 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.909
 well instead of recognizing toxic metal as poison and getting rid of it 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.519
 the body instead of this 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.769
 I tried to use it as a nutritional element 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.379
 and this is where the problem starts 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.569
 let's take mort mercury for example 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.109
 Mercury body wall looks like selenium mineral nutrient 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.879
 since most people are with ikea mind 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.699
 deficient selenium 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.870
 when a molecule of mercury floats around the bloodstream 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.779
 the body thinks 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:58.909
 also 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.879
 a little selenium 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.279
 I need that and he swallows it 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.319
 of course mercury may know is selenium 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.439
 but it does not act like selenium 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.079
 the truth is that it is 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.139
 that in many ways is what selenium is currently opposite 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.029
 since mercury is incorporated into our body 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.329
 is free to exercise its toxicity and influence 24 hours a day 

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:26.799
 generating free radicals by melting nerves and suppressing functions 

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.150
 immunological 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.639
 in the same way 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.150
 Lead is confused by calcium 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.090
 cadmium by zinc and 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.129
 and aluminum mikelet and uranium are confused by magnesium 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.569
 is this and if god toxic metal's ability to cheat the body in 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.090
 incorporate them into the tissues 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.509
 which makes it very difficult to get rid of them 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.509
 we do not have to live in toxic bodies 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:53.979
 thanks for your attention
