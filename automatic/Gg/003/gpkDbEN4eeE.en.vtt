00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
those and just kind of a Q&amp;A I guess

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.640 
those and just kind of a Q&amp;A I guess
whatever<00:00:20.310> um<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.570> should<00:00:21.840> police<00:00:22.140> say<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
whatever um I should police say that I

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.359 
whatever um I should police say that I
really<00:00:23.130> can't<00:00:23.369> read<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:23.730> own<00:00:23.760> handwriting<00:00:25.369> so

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
most of these names will probably be

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.540 
most of these names will probably be
butchered<00:00:29.849> pretty<00:00:30.090> bad<00:00:30.240> um<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.340> first

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
butchered pretty bad um the first

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.750 
butchered pretty bad um the first
question<00:00:32.759> comes<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:35.270> label<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.660> could<00:00:37.050> be

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
question comes from label that could be

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.250

cable<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> can't<00:00:39.239> tell<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.719> that's<00:00:39.899> an<00:00:40.079> hour

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
