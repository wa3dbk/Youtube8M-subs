00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the portion of pile here is the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 proportion so it was said up to here 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.950
 from this angle up to a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.730
 a little bit more I can't trust him 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.099
 of the quarters the game go on the short 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.809
 decided to take the portion of the GDP all 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.690
 amia redesigns all the way around the ticket 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.690
 as before however coming from the short one 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.250
 they are sites that for failure in val s la 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.800
 look let finish some 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.899
 concentrating has returned precisely there 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.980
 because he went around with this 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.230
 angulation 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.410
 if I had decided to go to the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.480
 long maybe I would n't have gone 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 I would have gone to the coast but on top of that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 would have wt mere but I'll do it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.000
 do we see then so 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.739
 the error 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 I went under the skilled then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.590
 decided around 10 if I had done 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 that is, or so we do 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
 see the error in this case here is not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.190
 I have never had for love what I am 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 past conceal yes jokes at ease 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 I risked it because I was already but then it would be 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.119
 difficult to even find coverage for 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 a hundred and feel a little now if we move it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.890
 now we move one more package was more 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.340
 there is no backhand and you pull with the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 4 and sorry and if we approach another 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.549
 solution 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 we find in this solution in this 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 positive solution so we don't have it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 let's get here with ours 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.320
 there were then there are several choices or 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.170
 there is clearly a title of the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.700
 genus can be made a strotto by increasing the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.909
 strength and then doing it here in the two 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 past and a half to that yes I had here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.299
 two passes back here if I do 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 two precise passes from jean will still be 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.729
 but here it is more certain, however, if I do two 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.850
 go through it with half that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.780
 to bring her here looks is satire is a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780
 a little bit stronger 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 these are two passes a little bit of 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.210
 more now I have a little exaggerated to foresee 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.950
 no, however, look at the cover there 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.539
 we are but even the city this 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 bidentino yes that was however they must 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.770
 it happens by force to do two and then two 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.670
 emerging civilian passers-by if you go to me 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.450
 even more so then here 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.610
 right here you see this often happens 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.730
 Here this is not about you do not have it anymore 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.120
 the proportion of returning here to the car 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.070
 play without effect by queuing up 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.140
 not caring where my bible goes 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.760
 which then why maybe a moment of the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.410
 then the ball if I want to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.600
 pull another solution as before 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.790
 it is necessary that from the three-pass games to 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.620
 come back here with ours then 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.560
 it is up to the left to make long and short 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.700
 come back there it's always hard instead 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.410
 this film is difficult but you can blog here 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.470
 there is also st grillo they give me a son 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.470
 just put the knot throw of the same 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.500
 we also came with the bill 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.260
 effect returns there that the network is better 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.390
 do it so that the one I will do prof 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.489
 certainly it is better to read because at least 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.850
 let's leave a spade shovel for years 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.250
 sure let me think now workings 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.870
 some other solution 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.079
 on this shot ok, there are solutions 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.049
 more little more acrobatic for example but 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.760
 let's do something to make it an acrobatics e 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.579
 after which we give the line a moment a 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.470
 a few moments of acrobatic advertising 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.850
 I can't even do this but come here 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 to come back right here 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.760
 I first get attracted it is it is a risk 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.760
 that is, it is seen however 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.540
 welcome my short too long 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.550
 this came the design but a lot 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.120
 nice this however I have to tell them 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.310
 one the other the usual one 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.040
 instead to go to caldaro and you are 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.650
 therefore not heating the usual instead of 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.920
 go in the long shot you come here 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.390
 in the short one comes here therefore 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.190
 solution 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.860
 the same title instead to arrive at 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.860
 long the one run less than the yellow 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:33.160
 that stops because it came to the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.050
 short understood parameter for withdrawal a 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.200
 of the advertising we hear again immediately 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.200
 after
