00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.309
 that started friends 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.249
 in the fall it will be a long time 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.560
 but first you have to go shopping 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.850
 I'll just take it with them and show them Born good flanks 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.380
 Recognize quality 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.500
 Flower bulbs like these tulip bulbs while on the different sizes 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.529
 offered 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.970
 the larger the onion or knowle and its largest usually 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.010
 also the flower 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.039
 The animals must be firm and should also be under light pressure 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.320
 do not give in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.350
 In addition, they should not be expelled yet and may not be a woman 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 occupy positions 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.420
 In case of storm, do not let big flowers distract you from among the greens 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.130
 because the actual quality 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.010
 these are drops 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.590
 Perennials should therefore come from drops and root balls before buying 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 check 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.000
 if it is at 100 percent the whole plant will develop well 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.660
 fiery with long white roots in the lower edge of the pot 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.030
 they are a sign that the plant has been standing too long in the pot 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.340
 and later will have trouble growing up 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.380
 The same is of course true for all other affected plants like 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.500
 Roses bloom shrubs and hedges plants 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.180
 Plants with topicality 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 must have three well-developed main rivals directly out 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060
 Come over 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 Plant image quality Hamm at least 2 poles of the earth main speech 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.360
 In addition, the processing station and the shoots must be damaged separately 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.880
 his 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.299
 Dead and dried up the lots are an alarm sign 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.730
 Flowering shrubs like this Deutz here 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.190
 should also have two strong grandstand and a finely branched 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.790
 Root system mister 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.750
 if they are not sure if drives if she is still alive 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 Slightly scratch the candidate with the thumbnail 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.810
 below it shows a fresh green color 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.040
 Is everything ok 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.840
 the bark dissolves badly 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.519
 and because the tissue is one of the important factors 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.499
 is not that healthy 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.859
 we come to the fruit trees 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.859
 Jena originating one differentiates here between yard ladies 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.239
 both are from 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.669
 and by fruits 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.519
 at a high stand like this apple tree you 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.909
 into the crown over at least one meter eighty 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.249
 important in the crown is too 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.729
 that you have a continuous main deck 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.709
 and at least two strong side shoots 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.069
 to hold the approximately at the same height 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.629
 Also pay attention to it 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.629
 that the tree has a possibly loaded unconfirmed trunk 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.069
 Finally, let's go for them 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.539
 bare root roses Shrubs and trees are already in the fall to buy 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.249
 and immediately plants 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.339
 they still have roots by the winter 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:57.179
 and grow much faster than laws next year 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.289
 this first mix early plants 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.229
 and now I wish you a lot of fun with the Plassnik 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.699
 also repeated rapper Sido 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.319
 in Saxony are still by hand until winter
