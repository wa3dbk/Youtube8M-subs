yep and faster startup and shutdown

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.830 
yep and faster startup and shutdown
times<00:03:37.889> than<00:03:38.099> Windows<00:03:38.370> XP<00:03:38.639> yeah<00:03:39.510> I've<00:03:39.629> seen<00:03:39.810> a

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
times than Windows XP yeah I've seen a

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.500 
times than Windows XP yeah I've seen a
few<00:03:40.019> benchmarks<00:03:40.609> some<00:03:41.609> refuting<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.180> claims

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
few benchmarks some refuting the claims

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.930 
few benchmarks some refuting the claims
that<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:43.049> faster<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:43.919> you<00:03:44.340> know<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.459> suppose

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
that it's faster but you know I suppose

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.729 
that it's faster but you know I suppose
a<00:03:44.970> lot<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.419> is<00:03:45.599> contingent<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a lot of that is contingent on the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.280 
a lot of that is contingent on the
hardware<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.549> running<00:03:47.849> on<00:03:47.940> yeah<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.109> he's

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
hardware it's running on yeah and he's

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890 
hardware it's running on yeah and he's
using<00:03:49.590> an<00:03:49.680> older<00:03:49.980> machine<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:51.120> seems<00:03:51.720> like

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
using an older machine and it seems like

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.830 
using an older machine and it seems like
it's<00:03:52.019> running<00:03:52.199> better<00:03:52.620> than<00:03:52.680> XP<00:03:53.129> did<00:03:53.310> Wow<00:03:54.299> on

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
it's running better than XP did Wow on
