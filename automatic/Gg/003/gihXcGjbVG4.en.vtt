00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
this would have to be I think this

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.900 
this would have to be I think this
summer<00:00:44.380> I'm<00:00:44.500> going<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.710> really<00:00:44.890> like<00:00:45.160> my<00:00:45.460> hip

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910

jelly<00:00:46.600> bomb<00:00:46.830> in<00:00:47.830> plush<00:00:48.400> and<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.210> looks<00:00:49.390> like

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
jelly bomb in plush and it looks like

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.140 
jelly bomb in plush and it looks like
this<00:00:49.810> and<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:51.340> it's<00:00:51.370> a<00:00:51.670> chapstick

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
this and just because it's a chapstick

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.080 
this and just because it's a chapstick
it<00:00:53.080> doesn't<00:00:53.440> have<00:00:53.500> SPF<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.130> it<00:00:54.220> but<00:00:54.490> I<00:00:54.760> will

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
it doesn't have SPF in it but I will

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.330 
it doesn't have SPF in it but I will
probably<00:00:55.330> get<00:00:55.720> a<00:00:55.780> chopstick<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.500> has<00:00:56.650> SPF<00:00:57.130> in

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340

probably get a chopstick that has SPF in
it<00:00:57.430> um<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.630> I'm<00:00:58.750> not<00:00:58.870> really<00:00:59.020> well<00:00:59.230> prepared

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350
