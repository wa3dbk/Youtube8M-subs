00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.870
 Big alarm on the airport Stuttgart Attention Attention 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 Luczak will lead to weeks of consequences 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.409
 the control center coordinates the mission 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.409
 the men of the fire department do not know what to look for 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.909
 important he is fast to the accident site 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 because every second counts in this hell of hell 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.489
 Functional check catastrophes exist lies dimensioned 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.350
 Special vehicles available 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.600
 the time to the exit is mandatory under 30 seconds 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.190
 the fire engines bring giants to life as if touching a button 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.760
 Awakening when they move out 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.829
 In case of emergency a lot of bonuses remain on the concrete 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.180
 because within a maximum of three minutes, the bright red delete 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.940
 Monster can be used at any point of the airport Stuttgart 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.840
 in the extreme case, it is 5 5 kilometers away from the RAF 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.750
 Therefore, the buses with their more than 50 tons of weight must be strong 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.269
 be motorized to meet the timetable 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.670
 before 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.680
 When the plane is just what if the airframe on many portions 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 In the narrowest of spaces, the wings have large amounts of Cyrus 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.760
 and if Mio still reckon at the scene of the accident that the plane is on fire 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.570
 it is assumed that Dobrindt and this in the course of their and the bottom of the cell 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.490
 Time we have to be friendly 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.110
 Hope back round 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.400
 if necessary, the four four-wheel drive axles allow one 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.770
 Rescue mission on inden flexible terrain 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.530
 while driving you can mix 12 tons of water with 1000 500 liters 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.920
 Foaming agents deliberately above high point let him hunt the flaming hell 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 The 380-tonne galaxy is the largest at this airport 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.490
 load airplane 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 After that, the equipment of the fire department 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.740
 Everything started in Stuttgart with fire fighting vehicles 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.570
 in the eye the Nano Tourbus the leopard tank were installed 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.039
 Much has changed technically since then 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.039
 not, however, the em-standard and engine performance 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.599
 Holzinger's such great joy 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.009
 but earlier also in Cologne so ban for example if needs 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.949
 need the big field 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.609
 and we put a lot of money must probably only 50 percent over the largest 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.909
 Formula 1 engine moment 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.120
 when the fire brigade's fire brigade puts the fire trucks on the runway 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.710
 decided 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.179
 a maximum of two men sit in the monster 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.879
 The technology is designed so that in case of emergency even only a firefighter 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.389
 drive and mix at the same time 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.079
 The Define Joystick Pupils strive to put the tremendous powers behind 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.179
 any harmless-looking switch 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.539
 Anytime a normal inspection trip can take over the airport too 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.009
 be a mission trip 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.909
 if then the driver kept very tight about the automatic transmission the enormous 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.159
 Forces especially on the special tires 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.539
 they are also regularly after only about 4000 kilometers to b 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.670
 and the blue light used 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.069
 the Pole has value on right of way in front of the aircraft 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.830
 such a colossus accelerates from 0 to 80 km / h in just over 20 seconds 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.140
 and it's fast under 40 kilometers per hour at most 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.179
 Problem not retract Victor but slowing down 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:25.809
 because well over 40 tons of weight push the red polo shirt vigorously 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.809
 therefore it takes some time and need many hours of training 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.579
 until the drivers are allowed to move the red giants because the prices of these 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.549
 Special vehicles are fine 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.799
 after execution between after 4 50 euros for postage 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.840
 the vehicles can 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.269
 if necessary, in the middle of the previous year 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.029
 However, it is important exactly and the training as here the extinguishing 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.399
 a plane seat 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:52.619
 this and the constant improvement of the equipment ensure that the 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:57.139
 chances of survival of the aircraft occupants in an accident continue to rise
