00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
like i don't really recommend this but i

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.830 
like i don't really recommend this but i
like<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.729> one<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.939> comes<00:01:51.180> into<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like the one that comes into and you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.149
