00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello everyone today we will have 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.599
 another computer unpacking bought 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.710
 we are such a miracle thing acer laptop 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.949
 2 5 and it will be unpacking 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 he was chosen long 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.519
 Now if you can see the characteristics but I 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.000
 I'll write them in the description of the video and also 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.980
 the model is likely to be the name 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 remove unpacking 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.489
 because to someone it will be possible 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.660
 I wonder what is included and how 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 looks like all sorts of power supplies what they 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.860
 size because they used to be 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.070
 standard rectangles and now 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.920
 for example, the same asus is expelled with 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.399
 minimalism and makes quite their 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.399
 little ones 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.150
 and bought because I needed home 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.840
 second computer 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.860
 More precisely, the laptop was something but it was already a little bit 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.290
 subrall rell and since I think that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 a laptop 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 as well as a personal computer it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.620
 the thing is strictly personal then the computer should 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.750
 everyone has to be his own 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.630
 such a rather thin posting 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 give birth to a standard euro and such 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.979
 here is the power supply for comparing 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.410
 power supply from an old laptop and her 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.310
 high right all things here 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.450
 light he's an eysir led eiser to whom 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.300
 how to like more 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.729
 Well, that is, progress is felt a little 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.009
 by weight approximately equally wired 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.009
 about the same as we have 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.570
 Here is a proprietary connector although 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.720
 he is in my opinion even in standard 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.360
 turns it to take away the exit to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.340
 plain dice about laptop 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.790
 began to do this I will not hide 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:10.739
 I don't think I need it well 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:14.070
 here is the apparatus itself, its main feature 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.200
 which we needed is the most 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.269
 compactness let's say the greatest 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.709
 compactness is yours 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:32.040
 broke nothing that's such a here 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.930
 the thing is we all remove this here 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.320
 apparatus 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.890
 thickness can be imagined immediately 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.080
 more centimeter but I'll give a link to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.590
 official site and there it will be possible 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.680
 see real sizes like this 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.470
 here's the thing here is a little bit of paperwork 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.239
 he himself is the metal here this part 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.709
 plastic metal cover 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.889
 Well, what to say, in principle, keys 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.490
 interesting before the configuration we have soon and 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:11.160
 5 4 2 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:15.820
 and the last haswell nvidia graphics card 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.490
 750m hard drive per terabyte and 8 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.080
 gigabytes of ram 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.770
 fifteen inch model 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.340
 screen resolution of 1366 by 768 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.720
 Well, of course they shoved windows 81 here 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.430
 as always screen tn matrix tn ovsky but 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.330
 so normal for this price 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.110
 categories 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.540
 this is almost the best option 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.230
 on the side we have an invisible power button 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.840
 small 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.870
 yusb 120 in the other side is another usb 2 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.350
 0 and connector for flash drives 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.380
 local headphone jack 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.340
 or headset 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.360
 in the back we have a connector for a regular lan network 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.870
 rj45 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.120
 yusb 30 hdmi and this one is a miracle connector 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.730
 for de saba for connecting external 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.220
 monitor monitors 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 lock thickening moan or something so i 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.780
 honestly don't remember what it's called 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.140
 and naturally the connector under the power supply 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.420
 the output is cooling at our back that is very 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:31.720
 very convenient also no covers from below 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:43.510
 No, and the battery is also non-removable 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:44.710
 well in the year of thickness so here it is included 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.100
 almost inaudible 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.700
 we already tried it in the store 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.370
 large touchpad is present inside 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.950
 buttons that are not very highlighted 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.520
 the button illumination looks nice 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.870
 present and here you can see 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.890
 turn on turn off apparently adjustments 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:13.090
 or programmatically or not adjustment 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.300
 Brightness is the minimum 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:21.090
 This is the maximum way more than 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:26.229
 in the past model, well, in general, in general 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.150
 interesting thing for this price of this 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.060
 Yes, I already said the most 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.789
 configuration interesting model because 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.460
 that something like this starts somewhere already thousands 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.280
 5 more 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.270
 we have two more LEDs on top 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.080
 on and apparently on low charge yes 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.600
 forgot to say he has no drive 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.180
 cd-rom 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.849
 so he is so subtle and proper 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.190
 saying light I believe that in the present 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.500
 time is already loaded via the Internet and 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.289
 does not have something to buy on disks 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:13.509
 the meaning is perfect but the most interesting 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:16.539
 need to tear off the films and the top and more 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.960
 one thing we bought this item for stock 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.060
 and us for the ruble 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.550
 offered to choose something else at 3000 and 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:29.139
 what we have chosen will be in the next video 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:33.220
 we went to the store for a long time and decided 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:37.960
 dwell on this more 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:43.590
 economic option well here's such 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:47.050
 thing in principle I like at home if 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.590
 not very large space and if 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:54.699
 need to carry a laptop with you very much 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.880
 good thing if there are any questions 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.620
 ask in the comments necessarily well 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.280
 and that's all thanks to everyone for watching 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.280
 goodbye
