00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
helmet on here so anyway this is I kind

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.010 
helmet on here so anyway this is I kind
of<00:01:05.519> prefer<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> weight<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
of prefer this because the weight is in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.140 
of prefer this because the weight is in
the<00:01:07.260> center<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> bike<00:01:07.890> versus<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> back<00:01:08.900> I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
the center of the bike versus the back I

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
the center of the bike versus the back I
remember<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.270> incident<00:01:13.189> growing<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.369> where<00:01:14.580> my

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
remember an incident growing up where my

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.359 
remember an incident growing up where my
younger<00:01:15.060> brother<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> those<00:01:16.369> back

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
younger brother was in one of those back

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
younger brother was in one of those back
a<00:01:17.729> rear-mounted<00:01:19.100> white<00:01:20.100> car<00:01:20.369> seats<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.500> he

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a rear-mounted white car seats and he

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.170 
a rear-mounted white car seats and he
took<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> tip<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> whacked<00:01:23.759> his<00:01:23.970> head

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
took a tip and kind of whacked his head

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630 
took a tip and kind of whacked his head
good<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.720> he<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> helmet<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
good thing he had a helmet on but it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
good thing he had a helmet on but it
could<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.880> been<00:01:26.970> much<00:01:27.150> worse<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:32.630> now<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> have

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
could have been much worse so now I have

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
could have been much worse so now I have
to<00:01:34.049> say<00:01:34.970> my<00:01:35.970> son's<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.390> 20<00:01:37.009> 24<00:01:38.009> pounds<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.430> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
to say my son's about 20 24 pounds or so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.840 
to say my son's about 20 24 pounds or so
now<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.360> he<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.590> getting<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.579> heavy

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
now and he is getting a little bit heavy

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
now and he is getting a little bit heavy
for<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> setup<00:01:42.799> um<00:01:44.570> probably<00:01:45.570> partly

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
for this setup um probably partly

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.160 
for this setup um probably partly
because<00:01:46.500> oh<00:01:50.000> sorry<00:01:51.000> hopefully<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.659> guys<00:01:51.840> can

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
because oh sorry hopefully you guys can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.649 
because oh sorry hopefully you guys can
get<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.500> good<00:01:52.680> footage<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.909> anyway

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
get some good footage here but anyway

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.370 
get some good footage here but anyway
probably<00:01:55.649> partially<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.759> my<00:01:57.329> bike<00:01:58.170> right

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
probably partially because my bike right

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.639 
probably partially because my bike right
now<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.649> set<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:58.950> as<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> single<00:01:59.490> speed<00:02:00.649> look

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
now is set up as a single speed look

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.330 
now is set up as a single speed look
both<00:02:01.860> ways<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.880> we're<00:02:03.149> good<00:02:03.680> um<00:02:04.680> so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
both ways there we go we're good um so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.810 
both ways there we go we're good um so
anyway<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.390> steep<00:02:06.689> terrain

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
anyway going on steep terrain

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.630 
anyway going on steep terrain
is<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.240> little<00:02:08.630> bit<00:02:08.750> more<00:02:08.960> difficult<00:02:09.490> being<00:02:10.490> a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
is a little bit more difficult being a

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.140 
is a little bit more difficult being a
single-speed<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.130> know<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.430> mostly<00:02:14.060> just

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
single-speed but you know we mostly just

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.790 
single-speed but you know we mostly just
use<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:15.830> ride<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> park<00:02:16.550> or<00:02:16.850> uh<00:02:17.800> you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
use it to get ride to the park or uh you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.170 
use it to get ride to the park or uh you
know<00:02:18.830> whatever<00:02:19.130> get<00:02:19.520> him<00:02:19.670> out<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> house

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
