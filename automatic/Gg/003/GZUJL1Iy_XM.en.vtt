00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.240
 all welcome try briefly and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.940
 Essentially in the first video I had 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 old power supply use was called 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.049
 as the driver now took more 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.350
 modern power supply and not to be 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.240
 unfounded here are his options in 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.880
 annotations and i will paint as 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.970
 distributed is power 300 watts 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.830
 that is, from here we see that by 12 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.160
 Volts it gives only 12 amps 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.570
 I promised to tell you how to use 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.450
 switch to use this driver 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 power supply in two modes 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:50.430
 but as you can see there is no mode 9 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.680
 volt and it would seem I was gone sick but 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.710
 I'll show you how to do it about what I wanted 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 specifically left it open wanted 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 sharpen attention but has no 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.710
 sense to solder the wires here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.460
 each of the voltage we have already soldered 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.350
 the unit goes to 5 wires 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:27.020
 orange 3 3 volts yellow 12 volts 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:31.020
 red 5 volts i.e. these wires 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 shortened and stripped by combining the output 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.680
 from the block we get normal and cross section 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.850
 for this one that gives out power 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.979
 block more 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 repo increasing the cross section you nothing 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.930
 achieve effect will be less than one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.189
 percent that is, what's the point to do 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.640
 nonsense block I advise you to vacuum 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:01.649
 clean and don't go there anymore 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.149
 began to remove terminals because 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 I still have computers 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.179
 working and going out with the internet and well 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.200
 sinichca plays lessons make kids no 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.800
 no point in changing my computer yet 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.880
 I do not see 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.750
 what can there be a nuance inclusion from 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 x here is the connector on the motherboard without 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.670
 motherboard to turn it on 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.270
 need to close the third and fourth wire 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 black green on the connectors to block y 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.870
 we were turned on from the button and so on 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.870
 block 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.480
 as you can see the voltage of 815 is already with 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.750
 drop wires here in all 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.910
 compounds I think if you remove the loss 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.170
 voltage here in these compounds then this 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.959
 will be 9 volts 9 volts gives this one 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.400
 switch 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.190
 so cheap because I knew everything 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.910
 I will not turn on more power 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.090
 middle position is off in this 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.130
 position 11 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.130
 well this is a loss of connections i think about 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.829
 12 volts and that is, you see 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.299
 three- mode switch off 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:21.989
 position position 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:26.160
 dim glow and position more 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.980
 bright glow I specifically in the dim 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.810
 mode, put two tapes 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.510
 that is, to connect such powerful 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.260
 tapes which 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.290
 about 10 watts per meter still makes sense 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.989
 here it is the tape that is there about 4 5 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.690
 watts per meter and dimmy and there is no sense 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.150
 that is, it turns out that it is in itself 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.670
 shines dimly and at half power 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.250
 Naturally she is not dim 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.459
 do not need a total and half power 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.470
 that's if you have bright ribbons it you 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.519
 With this key you can dim 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.519
 in different modes 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:15.749
 and what I advise 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 here on the block there is to turn it off by key 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:24.360
 supply on the high side and here already 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.800
 put the switch 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.900
 as i said pass switch 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.979
 you can replace this key where too 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.789
 3 pins 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:45.900
 where between two contacts switches 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:50.220
 and since I got 9 volts to 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:58.139
 I didnâ€™t have to get 9 volts to cheat 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:05:02.130
 directly drop from motherboard 12 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.759
 Volt I mean, plus I go right to 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.550
 tape 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.680
 and minus I take either with minus and here either with 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.039
 minus 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:18.060
 either minus i take with 3 volts and when we 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.979
 minus take with 3 volts it turns out 12 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.280
 minus 3 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:26.190
 we get 9 volts that's all actually 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.940
 the secret that is in such a simple way 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.500
 we can dim tape 2 times 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.280
 it is natural that here is the exit to the diode 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.590
 tape from the middle key contact 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.130
 she has two contacts for one serves minus for 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.250
 the other is served 3 volts to here so 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:49.919
 everything worked about what to say but in others 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:52.620
 videos when I filed cheated 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.400
 voltage stabilized on this tape i 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:00.000
 showed that this tape is starting 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:03.030
 glow at 7 volts i.e. up to 7 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.729
 volt it does not glow and actually 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.480
 speaking without dimming mode this one 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.180
 cops 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:16.970
 we fit from 7 to 12 volts and 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:20.850
 that's 8 9 volts just that figure 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:23.120
 which can tape use the background 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:28.040
 mode so it will last longer 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:32.130
 can use it at full capacity 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.940
 so here thanks for watching, see 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.940
 my videos
