00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.950
 I'm Milan is entering the Royal Palace 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 to see the exhibition of andy warhol 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.390
 inside there are about 130 works of the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 master of American pop art we go 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.699
 here is a preview now you have time until 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 March 9th to go see her in person 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.509
 if you are planning a trip to usa and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.329
 choose a comfortable casual style ever 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.100
 centric trend so warhol colors 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 flamboyant prints and round glasses 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.949
 alisi printed sweater 147 euro 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 coat in cloth alizzi 347 euro 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.970
 pull and bear glasses 12 euro leggings 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.300
 stradivarius 13 euros bag but lipari of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.969
 295 euro bershka ankle boot 46 euro two 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.670
 full casual mood outfit 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.620
 in short, the idea and I go around museums 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 maybe I go to another city 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 with the train or car anyway 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.660
 is suitable to be very comfortable and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.030
 comfortable 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 I would say that however you decide to dress 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.570
 whether you take inspiration from it or not 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.899
 bet the three-c rule applies 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.270
 or comfortable and warm and casual clothes 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.700
 maybe with a touch of originality 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 this radiotelephone as usual 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 now I bring you the usual location 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.429
 you will see that they have a new new wall 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.690
 therefore also changed the color of the lines 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.110
 hope you like it let's go see the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.110
 outfits 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.770
 nice perfect for this occasion 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.440
 and it means the authors are mixed a little 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 therefore winter and even spring was 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.650
 the small preview with the new ones 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.470
 second and never collections in stores 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.150
 you already find them then because in short 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.750
 this too is very whimsical 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.050
 in short there is the mood to originate 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.700
 right tub coats explained not 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.430
 it is true that you have to put it for false with 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.230
 neutral colors and beautiful if you mix civic 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.470
 There seems to always love them and 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.610
 in short, it does not prove versatility of 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.040
 interpretation I put this 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.290
 vintage american silk shirt e 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.810

 this top daniela woman is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.670
 the wedge and one look like stages 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.400
 good alternative and these are 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.010
 exaggerated very special bb walsh 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.110
 brown bordese certainly not all 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.860
 let's see the accessories while the bag 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.030
 a nice sum of strokes of color 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.500
 yellow 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.870
 this is fine because also the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.400
 shoulder bag is therefore convenient by the way 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 of strokes of color you will see that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.330
 even knitting seems and approaches 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.910
 an abstract painting 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.920
 all studied rightly then 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.500

 giulia vera bracelet is the 300 euro 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.020
 I thought leggings we showed one 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.440
 woman now for those who are rather short 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.470

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.430
 they are masculine with the discontinuous below 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.280
 because I chose remains because they are dark 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.959

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.670

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.120

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.850
 I spent a little more for the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.920
 accessories therefore shoes and shoulder bag 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.709
 here it is shoulder strap with gold chain 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.260

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.560
 since it is still cold between this is 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.840
