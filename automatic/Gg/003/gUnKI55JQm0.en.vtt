part<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.660> coupler<00:00:57.739> loic's<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> block

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
part of the coupler loic's I use a block

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.009 
part of the coupler loic's I use a block
bag<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.059> gently<00:01:00.930> pull<00:01:02.270> until<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.390> goes<00:01:03.629> down

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
bag and gently pull until this goes down

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.910 
bag and gently pull until this goes down
fast<00:01:05.810> see<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> part<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.680> looks<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
fast see the part that looks like a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
fast see the part that looks like a
screw<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> take<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.290> tip<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.720> pop

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
screw and then you take your tip and pop

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
screw and then you take your tip and pop
it<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.140> top<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.869> take<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> top<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it on top then you take the top of the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.719 
it on top then you take the top of the
coupler<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.810> top<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> tip<00:01:22.729> these

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
coupler up that on top of the tip these

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.230 
coupler up that on top of the tip these
three<00:01:23.970> down

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.620 

so<00:01:29.750> it's<00:01:29.900> pretty<00:01:30.080> tight<00:01:33.250> yeah<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:35.360> that's<00:01:35.450> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
so it's pretty tight yeah and that's it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.219 
so it's pretty tight yeah and that's it
so<00:01:36.470> then<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.950> would<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:37.659> hold<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.840> by<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
so then you would just hold it by the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.749 
so then you would just hold it by the
coupler<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:41.350> tuck<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.560> around<00:01:43.430> your<00:01:43.550> pan

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
coupler and tuck this around your pan

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.649 
coupler and tuck this around your pan
and<00:01:44.090> scoop<00:01:45.020> your<00:01:45.759> icing<00:01:46.759> inside<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.330> over

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
and scoop your icing inside of this over

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.810 
and scoop your icing inside of this over
your<00:01:47.780> frozen<00:01:48.020> yogurt<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:49.310> can<00:01:49.460> check<00:01:49.610> out<00:01:49.729> my

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.350 

so<00:01:56.509> that's<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.780> homemade<00:01:57.229> piping<00:01:57.950> bag<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.490> I

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
so that's a homemade piping bag and I

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.270 
so that's a homemade piping bag and I
feel<00:02:00.170> watching<00:02:00.590> when<00:02:00.710> you're<00:02:00.800> done<00:02:00.979> just

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
feel watching when you're done just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.820 
feel watching when you're done just
remove<00:02:02.270> your<00:02:02.630> coupler<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.259> tip<00:02:03.470> then<00:02:03.710> you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
remove your coupler and you tip then you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.279 
remove your coupler and you tip then you
throw<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.160> away<00:02:04.220> right<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> reason<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.229> I

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
throw it away right so the reason that I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.130 
throw it away right so the reason that I
said<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.860> should<00:02:07.130> get<00:02:07.729> all<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.090> your<00:02:08.239> yogurt

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
said you should get all of your yogurt

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.210

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
your leftovers to one side of the bag is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.520 
your leftovers to one side of the bag is
that<00:02:13.220> if<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.150> open<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.600> up<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:15.019> not<00:02:15.110> going

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530
