00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.959
 we just finished a very busy season 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.369
 tough 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.099
 a lot of disappointment but especially 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.689
 a lot of anger because I think 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.250
 that despite the difficulties when we 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.259
 knew to know a group that comes 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.469
 of cfa2 which goes up in cfa which shows 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.489
 national and we had to contract we 

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:29.950
 this feeling that there was largely 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.559
 but largely the means to 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.850
 maintain if the state of mind had been 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.950
 different so bankruptcy comes from 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.270
 well ground of the cloakroom and it's for 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.730
 it is said extremely badly because 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.350
 that I find that the rest of the club 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.450
 today works we just did 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.220
 a capital increase with 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.900
 new Alsatian shareholders who are 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.989
 join and trust in 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.320
 the durability of the club and in the future of the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.360
 club 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.739
 and unfortunately the field does not have 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.180
 been up to today's workforce 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.130
 is changing it's a bit of a 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.270
 cleaning up but there are also some 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.610
 players for whom it is a break 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.600
 health heart is going yes so we have a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.730
 dozen players to race 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.799
 contracts out of his twelve are two or 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.530
 three we want to leave and 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.909
 you pointed it out and some players 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.770
 let them go because they are in 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.570
 end of contract and it was painful 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.120
 so I can not of course all the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 quote but I think especially to Benjamin 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.640
 genghini with whom there is a big 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.010
 hesitation internally but eventually he 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.090
 is going to leave but are not moments 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.950
 easy but we have to take 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.840
 the right decisions to have a 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.979
 ambitious group next year he 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.530
 you will need a more impactful team 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.909
 in recovery and players with 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.280
 a good state of mind is these two 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.689
 criteria that will be paramount first 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.460
 criterion is the state of mind to find 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.260
 people who can enroll in a 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.510
 collective of individualities who want 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.369
 to enter a collective to win and 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.650
 not people who think of themselves 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.270
 after from a technical point of view 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.189
 jacky duguÃ©pÃ©roux to talk about 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.470
 recovery he also talked a lot 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.509
 of speed are wanting to find the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.500
 speed especially at offensive level 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.610
 to be more dangerous so we will 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.009
 try to work the next month 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.750
 to have the best team possible 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.490
 to obviously go back right away 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.259
 you know in which division you 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.299
 will play next year today we 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.280
 prepared both hypotheses obviously 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.590
 that the most serious hypothesis is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.800
 the cfa so we go we will work 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.080
 obviously for my 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.060
 immediately but we are ready if 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.320
 a good new arrival in a few 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.210
 weeks to be ambitious also in 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.820
 national then what are the criteria 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.320
 that you are going to ask the players who 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.270
 are going to be selected or who are going to be 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.520
 approached anyway good bah the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.070
 criteria already knows they have a lived 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.370
 at least national to come years erase 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.890
 I think it is 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 because if we have to go up and we go 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.040
 go up because that's the goal 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.080
 priority if not even that the wind in 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.730
 even greater difficulties and 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.860
 what players want and already a past 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.810
 at this level and that in case of a climb 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.730
 in national we do not have to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.629
 redo a complete team I think that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 there his seminar 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.909
 i think marc keller agrees 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.860
 with that and the profiles will give up players 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.470
 already experienced but who have 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.110
 want to succeed a project is to do 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.209
 to go back up strasbourg so here 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.609
 of the fort physically tactically 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.140
 technically and especially very strong in 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.209
 their heads and that correspond a little to 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 kind of player that I like then if we go there 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.340
 happens it's not won yet 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.319
 what can we expect the year 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.190
 next she will be there the team that 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.750
 you will present 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.010
 I do not know the names of all players 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.390
 what I know is that I would like 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 we practice a pleasant football 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.930
 because I think it's in 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.280
 playing football 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.480
 storage although we will win the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.730
 matches so I'm partisan it's 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.010
 now we'll see I'll adapt to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.740
 people at my disposal hoping 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.030
 that I am satisfied the defense the 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.010
 Balloon recovery is something 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.360
 thing that for you and is essential 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.460
 yeah that's what I said before 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.720
 good I do not want to be too long but in 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.770
 league 1 and league 2 teams 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.930
 champions are those who have the 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.430
 best defense in national too and 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.290
 three teams over four years in the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.640
 CFA groups are champions of their 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.640
 group with the best defense so that 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.200
 means that the recovery of the ball 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.120
 was paramount and that it concerns 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.380
 everyone and then then we will be able 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.520
 play that if we go rocker does not have the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.670
 balloon we can not pose any problems to 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.670
 the adversary
