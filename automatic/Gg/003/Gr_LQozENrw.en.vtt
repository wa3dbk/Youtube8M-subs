00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
to get materials from them very well

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.220 
to get materials from them very well
improvements<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.490> little<00:02:38.760> bit<00:02:39.000> different<00:02:39.960> so

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
improvements a little bit different so

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
improvements a little bit different so
this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.040> kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> link<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.670> i'll<00:02:41.760> explain

this is kind of link and i'll explain

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.450 
this is kind of link and i'll explain
but<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:43.530> game<00:02:43.680> you'll<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> chance<00:02:44.220> to

find these improvements toneczar temper
stones<00:02:47.310> right<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.720> these<00:02:48.900> are<00:02:48.960> used<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
stones right so these are used to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.180 
stones right so these are used to
improve<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.540> quality<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.230> item<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.770> going

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
improve the quality of the item so going

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.970 
improve the quality of the item so going
from<00:02:53.370> normal<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.000> fine<00:02:54.240> or<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.230> white<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
from normal to fine or like white to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.920 
from normal to fine or like white to
blue<00:02:56.160> or<00:02:56.340> white<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.730> green<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.270> bring<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
blue or white to green then bring to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.260 
blue or white to green then bring to
blue<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.830> know<00:02:58.920> uncommon<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.520> rare<00:02:59.670> just

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
blue you know uncommon to rare just

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.210 
blue you know uncommon to rare just
improving<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> item<00:03:01.080> level<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.830> general

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
improving the item level and the general

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.580 
improving the item level and the general
traits<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:03.600> traits<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.050> stats<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.500> I'd

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
traits not traits but stats that I'd

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
traits not traits but stats that I'd
make<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.860> better<00:03:05.040> right<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.880> there's<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
make it better right but there's a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.750 
make it better right but there's a
chance<00:03:06.360> associated<00:03:07.080> with<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.640> get

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
chance associated with it so if you get

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.730 
chance associated with it so if you get
five<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:09.930> temper<00:03:10.290> things<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
five of these temper things it's a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.290 
five of these temper things it's a
hundred<00:03:10.950> cent<00:03:11.160> chance<00:03:11.340> but<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.150> always

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
hundred cent chance but you can always

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.930 
hundred cent chance but you can always
temper<00:03:12.750> with<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.200> one<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:13.980> two<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.790> it's

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
temper with just one or two and it's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.160 
temper with just one or two and it's
always<00:03:15.060> at<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.240> twenty<00:03:15.540> percent<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:15.990> it's<00:03:16.110> just

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
always at a twenty percent so it's just

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.870 
always at a twenty percent so it's just
increments<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.650> twenty<00:03:16.860> percent<00:03:17.130> per<00:03:17.430> temper

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
increments of twenty percent per temper

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090 
increments of twenty percent per temper
item<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.080> this<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.290> really<00:03:19.410> risky<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.890> i'll<00:03:19.980> go

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
item so this is really risky but i'll go

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.470 
item so this is really risky but i'll go
ahead<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.610> try<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.820> improve<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.120> item

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
ahead and just try to improve this item

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.270 
ahead and just try to improve this item
if<00:03:21.600> i<00:03:21.810> fail<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.320> item<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.650> destroyed<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.860> again

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
if i fail the item is destroyed so again

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.880 
if i fail the item is destroyed so again
forty<00:03:26.700> percent<00:03:26.820> chance<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.650> just

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
forty percent chance this is just

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.130 
forty percent chance this is just
temporary<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.380> looks<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.920> fail

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
temporary and it looks like that fail

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.320 
temporary and it looks like that fail
improvement<00:03:34.140> attempt<00:03:34.470> filled<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:36.300> a

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
improvement attempt filled so it's a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.280 
improvement attempt filled so it's a
little<00:03:36.420> bit<00:03:36.510> more<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.750> an<00:03:36.810> advanced<00:03:37.020> thing

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
little bit more of an advanced thing

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.710 
little bit more of an advanced thing
very<00:03:37.590> risky<00:03:38.070> but<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.459> increase<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.730> item

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
very risky but you can increase the item

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.300 
very risky but you can increase the item
quality<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.170> something<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.650> make<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.220> better

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
quality of something and make it better

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.330 
quality of something and make it better
this<00:03:42.150> goes<00:03:42.270> for<00:03:42.300> weapons<00:03:42.630> or<00:03:42.720> armor<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:43.050> well

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
this goes for weapons or armor as well

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.130 
this goes for weapons or armor as well
now<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.400> research<00:03:44.760> thing<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.209> about<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
now the research thing is about the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.390 
now the research thing is about the
trait<00:03:46.470> i<00:03:46.680> was<00:03:46.920> talking<00:03:47.130> about<00:03:47.220> earlier

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
trait i was talking about earlier

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.550 
trait i was talking about earlier
remember<00:03:47.970> when<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.209> made<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.480> mace<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.110> use<00:03:49.350> this

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
remember when I made the mace I use this

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.040 
remember when I made the mace I use this
citrine<00:03:50.190> down<00:03:50.370> here<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.820> add<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.450> trait<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.840> it

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
citrine down here to add a trait to it

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.479 
citrine down here to add a trait to it
that<00:03:52.290> would<00:03:52.350> increase<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> weapon<00:03:53.250> attack

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
that would increase the weapon attack

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.949 
that would increase the weapon attack
speed<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:55.080> way<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> got<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.709> was<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.160> had<00:03:56.400> a

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
speed so the way I got that was I had a

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.240 
speed so the way I got that was I had a
mace<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.310> already<00:03:59.940> had<00:04:00.209> one<00:04:00.450> where<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.380> my

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
mace and I already had one where in my

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.949 
mace and I already had one where in my
inventory<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:03.709> have<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:05.090> hammer<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.540> has<00:04:06.720> this

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
inventory I have a hammer that has this

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.290 
inventory I have a hammer that has this
kind<00:04:07.050> of

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
kind of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.250 
kind of
trait<00:04:08.930> below<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:10.370> text<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.360> can<00:04:11.540> can't

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
trait below it so this text I can can't

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.300 
trait below it so this text I can can't
wear<00:04:12.380> school<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.740> side<00:04:12.920> but<00:04:13.100> it<00:04:13.130> says

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
wear school is the side but it says

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.150 
wear school is the side but it says
sharpened<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.360> can<00:04:14.810> deconstruct<00:04:15.320> this<00:04:15.770> mace

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
sharpened so I can deconstruct this mace

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.960 
sharpened so I can deconstruct this mace
and<00:04:16.430> get<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.090> sharpened<00:04:17.810> straight<00:04:18.080> from<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.970> so

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and get a sharpened straight from it so

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.390 
and get a sharpened straight from it so
that's<00:04:20.180> how<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.330> got<00:04:20.540> that's<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.200> citrine<00:04:22.070> and

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
that's how I got that's that citrine and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.150 
that's how I got that's that citrine and
improved<00:04:23.210> weapons<00:04:24.080> speed<00:04:24.290> attack<00:04:24.560> trait<00:04:24.920> that

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
improved weapons speed attack trait that

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.850 
improved weapons speed attack trait that
I<00:04:25.220> use<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.430> citrine<00:04:25.820> for<00:04:26.170> was<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.320> had<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.500> hammer

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
I use a citrine for was I had a hammer

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.490 
I use a citrine for was I had a hammer
that<00:04:28.460> had<00:04:28.670> that<00:04:28.910> weighted<00:04:29.300> trait<00:04:29.900> on<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.440> I

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
that had that weighted trait on it and I

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.650 
that had that weighted trait on it and I
researched<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.700> I<00:04:32.150> got<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.480> trade

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
researched it and I got that trade

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.590 
researched it and I got that trade
anyway<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.680> do<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.400> have<00:04:34.670> does<00:04:35.480> I

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
anyway so to do this you have does I

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.270 
anyway so to do this you have does I
have<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> hammer<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.380> has<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.920> sharpened

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
have a hammer that has the sharpened

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.310 
have a hammer that has the sharpened
trade<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.640> can<00:04:38.300> research<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.080> takes

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
trade I can research that and that takes

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.280 
trade I can research that and that takes
time<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:40.700> for<00:04:41.240> me<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.450> takes<00:04:41.600> 12<00:04:41.930> hours<00:04:42.050> to

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
time so for me it takes 12 hours to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.320 
time so for me it takes 12 hours to
research<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.860> one<00:04:43.010> trait<00:04:43.250> which<00:04:43.460> is<00:04:43.610> quite<00:04:44.270> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
research that one trait which is quite a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.090 
research that one trait which is quite a
long<00:04:44.480> time<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.750> that's<00:04:44.930> 12<00:04:45.230> hours<00:04:45.380> real<00:04:45.920> time

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
long time and that's 12 hours real time

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.460 
long time and that's 12 hours real time
by<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.520> way<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.080> go<00:04:48.290> ahead<00:04:48.380> and

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
by the way so I can go ahead and

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.620 
by the way so I can go ahead and
research<00:04:48.800> that<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.280> way<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.730> could<00:04:50.000> have<00:04:50.120> more

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.360 

specialization<00:04:53.630> in<00:04:54.110> mesa<00:04:54.770> since<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.220> like

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
specialization in mesa since I like

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.000 
specialization in mesa since I like
using<00:04:55.490> these<00:04:55.730> weapons<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.590> again<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.860> can

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
using these weapons so again I can

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.010 
using these weapons so again I can
research<00:04:58.430> this<00:04:58.610> that<00:04:59.390> takes<00:04:59.570> about<00:04:59.660> 12<00:04:59.900> hours

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
research this that takes about 12 hours

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.170 
research this that takes about 12 hours
so<00:05:00.290> 12<00:05:00.530> hours<00:05:00.710> when<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.890> check<00:05:01.100> back<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:02.060> now

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
so 12 hours when I check back I can now

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.680 
so 12 hours when I check back I can now
start<00:05:02.510> making<00:05:02.960> maces<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.680> have<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:03.980> trait

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.600 

that<00:05:08.690> goes<00:05:08.840> for<00:05:09.020> armor<00:05:09.260> as<00:05:09.320> well<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:10.490> can

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
that goes for armor as well you can

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.920 
that goes for armor as well you can
improve<00:05:10.880> how<00:05:11.300> many<00:05:11.510> things<00:05:11.750> you're

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
improve how many things you're

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.200 
improve how many things you're
