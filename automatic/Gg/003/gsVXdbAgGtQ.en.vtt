00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.250 
a bunch of the components as well
they've<00:02:26.070> added<00:02:26.460> germanium<00:02:26.940> diodes<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:28.080> more

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260

and a little bit more volume and squish

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.030 
and a little bit more volume and squish
kind<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.050> described<00:02:34.440> as<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.740> almost<00:02:34.890> a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
kind of described as it's almost a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.950 
kind of described as it's almost a
tighter<00:02:35.430> sounded<00:02:36.270> compressor<00:02:36.720> more

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960

transparent sort of less obvious in some

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.500 
transparent sort of less obvious in some
ways<00:02:41.280> but<00:02:41.550> there's<00:02:41.760> still<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> lot<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.150> squish

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
ways but there's still a lot of squish

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.190 
ways but there's still a lot of squish
and<00:02:42.750> compression<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.560> attack<00:02:44.550> sustain

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and compression and attack sustain

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.980 
and compression and attack sustain
control<00:02:46.200> qualities<00:02:47.100> available<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.760> I'm<00:02:48.720> just

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
control qualities available so I'm just

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.490 
control qualities available so I'm just
going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> increase<00:02:49.580> both<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.610> attack<00:02:52.070> and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
going to increase both the attack and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.780 
going to increase both the attack and
the<00:02:55.500> sustain<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.250> each<00:02:56.520> pedal<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:01.520> I'm<00:03:02.520> going

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the sustain on each pedal and I'm going

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.430 
the sustain on each pedal and I'm going
to<00:03:02.850> pull<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.450> something<00:03:03.960> for<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> now

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:19.059 

you

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:47.550 

you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.050 

so<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.590> really<00:03:49.010> noticed<00:03:49.340> quite<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> difference

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
so I really noticed quite a difference

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.000 
so I really noticed quite a difference
actually<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.599> release<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.650> release

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
actually in the release the release

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.800 
actually in the release the release
seems<00:03:52.610> quite<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> bit<00:03:53.150> smoother<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.629> hi-fi

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
seems quite a bit smoother on the hi-fi

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.050 
seems quite a bit smoother on the hi-fi
mod<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:55.069> I'm<00:03:55.190> not<00:03:55.519> sure<00:03:55.700> if<00:03:55.790> that's<00:03:55.879> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
mod and I'm not sure if that's the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.589 
mod and I'm not sure if that's the
germanium<00:03:56.870> diodes<00:03:57.379> or<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:59.180> all<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.480> other

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
germanium diodes or just all the other

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.930 
germanium diodes or just all the other
component<00:04:00.319> changes<00:04:00.650> I'm<00:04:01.519> just<00:04:01.700> going<00:04:01.879> to

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
component changes I'm just going to

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.900 
component changes I'm just going to
increase<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.569> attack<00:04:02.930> here<00:04:03.379> all<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.430> way<00:04:04.580> on

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
increase the attack here all the way on

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:16.830 
increase the attack here all the way on
both<00:04:05.209> metals<00:04:05.599> and

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:40.659 

you

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.890 

so<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.760> can<00:04:41.910> hear<00:04:42.090> how<00:04:42.120> quickly<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.810> can

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
so you can hear how quickly it can

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.310 
so you can hear how quickly it can
