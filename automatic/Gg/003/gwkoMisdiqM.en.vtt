00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 pokemon to see this gap 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.149
 interspace here in the middle of the sky 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.039
 we approach her and warn us that 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.620
 everything is very calm and what if 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.629
 we want to fly and get in then come 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.820
 we go there recommended as 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.369
 you already know how to save the game 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.810
 before going for a legendary pokémon 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.110
 for what it could happen 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.630
 first of all I had to do not 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.000
 I remembered that I had it at first 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.350
 place but good nothing happens at the moment 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.210
 let's use a quick bowl because 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.890
 you know we have here this challenge that the day 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.520
 that a little more legendary stays 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.060
 trapped in a fast blood bowl 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.060
 dancing 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.960
 and do not even think about anything today will not be the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.920
 day 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.290
 well there he is starting to counterattack 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.240
 for the moment we are holding up well it is not 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.700
 very effective and since I have here to do 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.540
 I'm going to use it to wear down 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.119
 you something is not going to be very effective is not going to 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.080
 be very effective but little by little and it arrives 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.260
 wearing what 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.300
 and if I weakened the then nothing happens 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.770
 I'll change pokemon for now 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.490
 to take advantage of that is here we are going to 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.360
 use again for normal and that has 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.360
 worn out 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.750
 little by little at the moment we do not have 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.060
 hurry we go well turn 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.640
 I do not know that, but that does not happen 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.760
 I will not heal to do not go and change it 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.680
 at the moment that continues attacking with another 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.319
 paranormal 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.090
 and we go to a certain time to also 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.730
 shifts so he can do more 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.800
 effective the turn bolt when that arrives 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.560
 good moment until the weakened 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.700
 nothing happens more or less went inside 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.810
 of my plans we are going to take out and dear ones 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.020
 with iker and your I think I can 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.910
 use once without any problem the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.750
 I hope I'm not wrong 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.840
 let's go there force 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:07.110
 perfect red zone footprint is just 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.050
 where I wanted to have something like that 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.720
 that 's done enough damage we're going to 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.440
 change pokemon let's take out the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.280
 place me 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.830
 to gaby 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.040
 because gabi is going to hold up pretty well 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.450
 I think it 's not all the vast majority of 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.580
 the attacks 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.290
 in it there is little gabi but you do not 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.010
 emotions to hit you what you have 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.010
 what to do is endure 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.910
 we are going to use since balls 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.250
 poker launch is an ultra vol 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.370
 we started with the national sport of my 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.920
 home to the launch of ball ship there 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.590
 we're 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.470
 will be lucky will stay the first there 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.890
 one and it will not be thought a little bit but it has 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.220
 finished convincing him 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.700
 with the fair we will hold up well 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.580
 there we are good skill well we continue 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.520
 with the ultra vol 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.820
 we are going to launch a total of three or four 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:15.370
 more or less 1 2 and it will not be weighed a 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.079
 little bit more but where the whole to see if 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.079
 the third one is the loser 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.880
 there we also hold up pretty well 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.880
 attack 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.190
 and come another ultra ball this would be the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.590
 third a drink the fourth because I'm going 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:38.200
 counting the one of the goal does not and well it seems 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.110
 who wants but does not want at all he 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.860
 he thinks he thinks he comes come over there 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.860
 one more 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:52.640
 this is the fourth 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.150
 fourth ultra vol 2 and is not undecided 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.350
 is undecided is a want and I can not 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.170
 cerebral prof can make us a 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.760
 little bit of damage there is but we hold 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:08.450
 well we hold up well let's use 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.620
 a potion to cure us here to gabi and 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.510
 proportional canton 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.000
 just in case it gives you to make us 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.810
 We followed the other oral sphere cover 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.200
 the backs 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.860
 there he had recovered his fish 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.580
 ok this is good for me 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.470
 this attack is good for me to do it 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.450
 and come back 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.640
 come, we are already with the bolivar turns 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.540
 has launched another ultra ball but let's go now 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.540
 for the shifts 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:45.169
 the verbena and nothing has not thought 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:48.620
 that was not even a shine to the pokemon 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.940
 distortion does not bother me this attack 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.940
 we hold well 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.330
 and come 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.930
 we continue with the turn at the time but 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:05.480
 when I have three or four shifts I will go 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.480
 back to the sub trouble to see 12 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.420
 and if it is already there is this is the threat 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.510
 when he threatened them to change little 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.240
 bag and the center is left and something trapped 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.690
 I have not spent much pokemon either 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.970
 been a good catch to be a 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.550
 legendary has been quite fast the 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:29.140
 has had faster but has not 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:31.600
 been nothing bad and something caught os 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.690
 I remember saying it only comes out in the 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.640
 Alpha sapphire version in the blonde version 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.910
 mega we will find ourselves by the same 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.930
 method a park already good then now 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.000
 is pokemon captured I remind you that 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.990

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.610

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.770
 what pokemon entrants arrived at this 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.990
