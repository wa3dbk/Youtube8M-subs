00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
games look awesome in co-op anyway so it

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.659 
games look awesome in co-op anyway so it
should<00:04:17.479> be<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.600> lot<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.780> fun<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.109> play<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:19.519> then

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
should be a lot of fun to play and then

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.430

what<00:06:03.960> you<00:06:04.080> guys<00:06:04.110> want<00:06:04.589> we<00:06:04.680> tried<00:06:04.919> to<00:06:05.069> implement

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
what you guys want we tried to implement

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.129 
what you guys want we tried to implement
this<00:06:05.610> system<00:06:05.819> to<00:06:06.149> make<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:06.419> easier<00:06:06.779> for<00:06:07.050> you

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
this system to make it easier for you

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.529 
this system to make it easier for you
but<00:06:07.800> it's<00:06:07.979> not<00:06:08.069> testing<00:06:08.669> well<00:06:08.819> you<00:06:09.089> guys<00:06:09.270> don't

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
but it's not testing well you guys don't

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.779 
but it's not testing well you guys don't
like<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:10.050> so<00:06:10.469> because<00:06:10.680> it's<00:06:11.009> only<00:06:11.279> a<00:06:11.310> software

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
like it so because it's only a software

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.639 
like it so because it's only a software
thing<00:06:12.060> I'm<00:06:12.270> assuming<00:06:12.719> that<00:06:12.839> all<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.139> drm

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649 
thing I'm assuming that all this drm

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.499 
thing I'm assuming that all this drm
stuff<00:06:13.800> can<00:06:14.099> be<00:06:14.129> removed<00:06:14.430> by<00:06:14.879> a<00:06:14.909> software<00:06:15.479> I

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
stuff can be removed by a software I

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.619 
stuff can be removed by a software I
don't<00:06:15.810> how<00:06:16.319> can<00:06:16.469> it<00:06:16.560> be<00:06:16.589> a<00:06:16.649> hardware<00:06:16.979> thing<00:06:17.629> and

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
don't how can it be a hardware thing and

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.100 
don't how can it be a hardware thing and
say<00:06:18.930> look<00:06:19.399> done<00:06:20.399> it'll<00:06:20.849> it'll<00:06:21.270> be<00:06:21.479> an<00:06:21.719> open

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
say look done it'll it'll be an open

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.379 
say look done it'll it'll be an open
kind<00:06:22.319> of<00:06:22.500> system<00:06:22.830> much<00:06:23.009> like<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.339> Xbox<00:06:23.550> 360<00:06:24.210> is

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
kind of system much like the Xbox 360 is

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.959 
kind of system much like the Xbox 360 is
we've<00:06:25.229> got<00:06:25.439> rid<00:06:25.620> of<00:06:25.649> the<00:06:25.830> drm<00:06:26.310> stuff<00:06:26.490> we've<00:06:26.819> got

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
we've got rid of the drm stuff we've got

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:27.950 
we've got rid of the drm stuff we've got
rid<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.330> connect<00:06:27.629> to<00:06:27.689> the<00:06:27.810> internet

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
rid of the connect to the internet

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.659 
rid of the connect to the internet
unless<00:06:28.379> you<00:06:28.620> want<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.860> turn<00:06:29.039> it<00:06:29.189> on<00:06:29.310> you<00:06:29.520> can

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
unless you want to turn it on you can

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.850 
unless you want to turn it on you can
easily<00:06:29.879> turn<00:06:30.210> it<00:06:30.389> off<00:06:30.680> hopefully<00:06:31.680> they<00:06:31.800> do

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
easily turn it off hopefully they do

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.740 
easily turn it off hopefully they do
that<00:06:32.189> to<00:06:32.339> save<00:06:32.580> face<00:06:32.849> I<00:06:33.149> mean<00:06:33.300> they<00:06:33.419> can<00:06:33.569> still

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
that to save face I mean they can still

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.140 
that to save face I mean they can still
keep<00:06:33.899> the<00:06:34.019> price<00:06:34.289> obviously<00:06:34.500> because

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
keep the price obviously because

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.820 
keep the price obviously because
with<00:06:35.540> Kinect<00:06:35.900> a<00:06:36.020> lot<00:06:36.140> of<00:06:36.230> people<00:06:36.440> forget<00:06:36.650> that

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
with Kinect a lot of people forget that

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.340 
with Kinect a lot of people forget that
that<00:06:37.040> thing<00:06:37.220> has<00:06:37.370> to<00:06:37.490> be<00:06:37.550> expensive<00:06:38.200> my<00:06:39.200> other
