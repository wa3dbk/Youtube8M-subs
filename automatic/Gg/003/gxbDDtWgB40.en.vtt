over so we've got another swinging thing

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.040 
over so we've got another swinging thing
but<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:35.970> time<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.300> can't<00:02:36.510> jump<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:36.840> it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
but this time we can't jump over it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.360 
but this time we can't jump over it
because<00:02:37.170> then<00:02:37.350> we'll<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.860> land<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
because then we'll just land in the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.740 
because then we'll just land in the
spikes<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.780> we'll<00:02:40.350> slide<00:02:40.620> under<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
spikes there so we'll slide under it and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.570 
spikes there so we'll slide under it and
now<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.590> another<00:02:43.800> challenge<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
now we get to another challenge the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.550 
now we get to another challenge the
double<00:02:45.300> sword<00:02:45.810> blades<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:49.140> only<00:02:49.410> way<00:02:49.500> to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
double sword blades so the only way to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.610 
double sword blades so the only way to
get<00:02:49.770> through<00:02:50.010> these<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:51.270> time<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.810> air<00:02:52.260> roll

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
get through these is to time a air roll

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.440 
get through these is to time a air roll
properly<00:02:53.190> see<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.880> can<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.150> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
properly see if we can do that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.800 
properly see if we can do that
oh<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.650> close<00:02:56.010> oh<00:02:57.590> okay<00:02:58.590> I'm<00:02:58.830> gonna<00:02:59.630> just<00:03:00.630> put

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.190 
oh so close oh okay I'm gonna just put
my<00:03:00.959> spawn<00:03:01.280> right<00:03:02.280> over<00:03:02.520> there<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.170> I

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
my spawn right over there so that I

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.060 
my spawn right over there so that I
don't<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.560> go<00:03:04.650> through<00:03:04.860> all<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.950> that

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
don't have to go through all of that

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.390 
don't have to go through all of that
again

oh my hope I haven't put myself on the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.630 
oh my hope I haven't put myself on the
spikes<00:03:08.040> no<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.700> was<00:03:08.880> correct<00:03:10.640> um<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:14.220> seems<00:03:14.520> the

arrow thing yeah it's interesting the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.759 
arrow thing yeah it's interesting the
animations<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.230> written<00:03:28.560> properly

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
animations not written properly

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.610 
animations not written properly
sometimes<00:03:32.780> anyway<00:03:33.780> um

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
sometimes anyway um

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.400 
sometimes anyway um
next<00:03:35.190> up<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> security<00:03:36.090> camera<00:03:36.269> thing<00:03:36.600> so

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
next up is a security camera thing so

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.410 
next up is a security camera thing so
obviously<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.489> get<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.760> its<00:03:38.910> line<00:03:39.390> of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
obviously if you get in its line of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.940 
obviously if you get in its line of
sight<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.080> tell<00:03:40.260> something<00:03:40.650> bad<00:03:40.799> is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
sight you can tell something bad is

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.890 
sight you can tell something bad is
going<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.100> happen<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:42.030> let<00:03:42.510> me<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:42.840> this

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
going to happen so let me get in this

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.610 
going to happen so let me get in this
line<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.170> sight<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.060> yep<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.930> die<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.959> let's

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
line of sight and yep you die so let's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.039 
line of sight and yep you die so let's
avoid<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.580> time<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.600> as<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.780> get<00:03:51.900> to

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
avoid that this time so as you get to

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.590 
avoid that this time so as you get to
the<00:03:52.140> end<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.410> level<00:03:53.030> you'll<00:03:54.030> see<00:03:54.330> these

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
the end of the level you'll see these

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.360 
the end of the level you'll see these
blocks<00:03:56.570> made<00:03:57.570> up<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.930> little<00:03:58.350> boulders<00:03:59.160> and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
blocks made up of little boulders and

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.190 
blocks made up of little boulders and
they<00:03:59.430> look<00:03:59.580> kind<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.850> precarious<00:04:00.200> that's

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
they look kind of precarious that's

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.539 
they look kind of precarious that's
because<00:04:01.380> they<00:04:01.500> are<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:01.950> land<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.370> them

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
because they are as you land on them

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.500 
because they are as you land on them
they'll<00:04:02.790> disintegrate<00:04:05.030> let's<00:04:06.030> hop<00:04:06.209> over<00:04:06.360> here

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
they'll disintegrate let's hop over here

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.110 
they'll disintegrate let's hop over here
and<00:04:06.930> we<00:04:07.650> will<00:04:07.830> reach<00:04:08.070> our<00:04:08.370> first<00:04:08.820> checkpoint

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
and we will reach our first checkpoint

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.060 
and we will reach our first checkpoint
so<00:04:10.079> if<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.799> were<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.190> die<00:04:11.340> now<00:04:12.799> we<00:04:13.799> would<00:04:13.920> come

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
so if we were to die now we would come

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.969 
so if we were to die now we would come
back<00:04:14.250> over<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.489> which<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.180> handy<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.410> these

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
back over here which is handy so these

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.490 
back over here which is handy so these
blocks<00:04:17.310> here<00:04:17.720> disappear<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.900> yet<00:04:19.109> close<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
blocks here disappear is yet close to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.089 
blocks here disappear is yet close to
them<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:21.329> kind<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.540> got<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.750> remember

I've<00:05:37.500> got<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.710> say<00:05:37.830> about<00:05:37.920> this<00:05:38.190> game<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.730> in

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
I've got to say about this game that in

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.240 
I've got to say about this game that in
the<00:05:39.840> end<00:05:39.960> it<00:05:40.140> will<00:05:40.320> be<00:05:40.470> randomly<00:05:41.160> generated

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
the end it will be randomly generated

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.280 
the end it will be randomly generated
the<00:05:42.150> levels<00:05:43.490> so<00:05:44.750> well<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.810> mean<00:05:45.930> because<00:05:46.170> it's

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
the levels so well I mean because it's

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.730 
the levels so well I mean because it's
an<00:05:46.350> endless<00:05:46.560> runner<00:05:46.800> no<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.280> can't

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
an endless runner no I can't

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.120 
an endless runner no I can't
conscious<00:05:49.740> I'll<00:05:49.860> sit<00:05:50.100> here<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:52.040> create<00:05:53.040> an

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
conscious I'll sit here and create an

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.710 
conscious I'll sit here and create an
infinite<00:05:53.370> number<00:05:53.520> of<00:05:53.880> challenges<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.630> would

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
infinite number of challenges that would

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.580 
infinite number of challenges that would
just<00:05:54.930> be<00:05:55.140> ridiculous<00:05:55.890> so<00:05:56.900> yeah<00:05:57.900> is<00:05:58.140> that<00:05:58.350> and

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
just be ridiculous so yeah is that and

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.710 
just be ridiculous so yeah is that and
secondly<00:05:59.310> the<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:01.380> game<00:06:01.760> is<00:06:02.760> called<00:06:03.090> malice

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
secondly the the game is called malice

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.610 
secondly the the game is called malice
the<00:06:04.170> moment<00:06:04.580> so<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:06.390> reason<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:07.260> is<00:06:07.410> called

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
the moment so the reason that is called

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.090 
the moment so the reason that is called
malice<00:06:08.010> is<00:06:08.250> because<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.360> have<00:06:09.810> decided<00:06:10.800> that

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
malice is because I have decided that

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.420 
malice is because I have decided that
this<00:06:11.490> whole<00:06:11.790> land<00:06:12.180> here<00:06:12.660> is<00:06:13.410> called<00:06:13.890> malice

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
this whole land here is called malice

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.370 
this whole land here is called malice
because<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.390> know<00:06:15.510> it's<00:06:15.630> evil<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.110> it<00:06:16.200> wants

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
because you know it's evil and it wants

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.190 
because you know it's evil and it wants
to<00:06:16.440> kill<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.300> think<00:06:18.630> malice<00:06:19.050> is<00:06:19.170> a

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
to kill you so I think malice is a

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
to kill you so I think malice is a
pretty<00:06:19.380> apt<00:06:19.680> name<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:21.680> yeah<00:06:22.680> so<00:06:22.890> if<00:06:23.040> you<00:06:23.070> have

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
pretty apt name and yeah so if you have

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.280 
pretty apt name and yeah so if you have
