00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you need to undo that and then there's a

you need to undo that and then there's a
nice<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.859> groove<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> can

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.660 
actually kind of get your thumb under
and<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.439> comes<00:01:04.650> right<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.189> very<00:01:05.369> nervous

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and it comes right off it's very nervous

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.740 
and it comes right off it's very nervous
if<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> takes<00:01:06.119> six<00:01:06.479> csail<00:01:07.200> batteries<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
if it takes six csail batteries and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
if it takes six csail batteries and
you're<00:01:12.900> done<00:01:13.080> moving<00:01:13.560> back<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> trigger

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you're done moving back is the trigger

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
you're done moving back is the trigger
it's<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> very<00:01:14.670> smooth<00:01:14.939> trigger<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.450> much<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's a very smooth trigger not much to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539 
it's a very smooth trigger not much to
say<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.650> find<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> interesting<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
say but I do find it interesting that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
say but I do find it interesting that
you're<00:01:18.210> pulling<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.570> trigger<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.110> you're

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
you're pulling a trigger but all you're

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.870 
you're pulling a trigger but all you're
doing<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:19.799> pushing<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.549> switch

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
doing is actually pushing a switch

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
doing is actually pushing a switch
button<00:01:21.210> back<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> electronic<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
button back there for the electronic to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.200 
button back there for the electronic to
supply<00:01:22.740> circuit<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.460> moving<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
supply circuit and moving up is the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.240 
supply circuit and moving up is the
on-off<00:01:24.600> switch<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> switch

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
on-off switch this is actually a switch

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
on-off switch this is actually a switch
just<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> trigger<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.720> sits

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
just like the trigger but this one sits

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
just like the trigger but this one sits
in<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> position<00:01:28.530> there's<00:01:29.040> an<00:01:29.189> off<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
in a position there's an off which is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
in a position there's an off which is
forward<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.509> which<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> rear

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
forward and on which is in the rear

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
forward and on which is in the rear
position<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
position this is just one of the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.460 
position this is just one of the
switches<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.840> trigger<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.229> also

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
switches and your trigger is also

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.020 
switches and your trigger is also
another<00:01:34.680> switch<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> say<00:01:35.430> switch<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
another switch when I say switch it's a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.330 
another switch when I say switch it's a
switch<00:01:36.659> within<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.049> circuit<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
switch within a circuit so this is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.590 
switch within a circuit so this is
actually<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.729> draining<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> battery

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually not draining the battery

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.539 
actually not draining the battery
keeping<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.470> position<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.369> is

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
keeping it in the on position this is

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.859 
keeping it in the on position this is
completely<00:01:41.880> fine<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> plasterer<00:01:42.720> there

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
completely fine for the plasterer there

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.300 
completely fine for the plasterer there
are<00:01:42.990> no<00:01:43.079> Kelly<00:01:43.290> Dee's<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.740> light<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.040> saying

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
are no Kelly Dee's that light up saying

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
are no Kelly Dee's that light up saying
like<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> Firefly<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.720> leave<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.930> on

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
like in the Firefly if you leave that on

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
like in the Firefly if you leave that on
your<00:01:46.470> batteries<00:01:46.799> will<00:01:46.950> eventually<00:01:47.399> die<00:01:47.549> if

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
your batteries will eventually die if

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.460 
your batteries will eventually die if
you<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.930> position<00:01:49.079> that's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you put this in the on position that's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.960 
you put this in the on position that's
not<00:01:49.649> gonna<00:01:49.799> die<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.490> circuits<00:01:50.850> not

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
not gonna die because your circuits not

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
not gonna die because your circuits not
complete<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> you're<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> be

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
complete and you're not going to be

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.480 
complete and you're not going to be
wasting<00:01:52.320> energy<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.100> wouldn't<00:01:53.340> recommend

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
wasting energy but I wouldn't recommend

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.130 
wasting energy but I wouldn't recommend
leaving<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.119> an<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.329> position<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:55.020> if

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
leaving in an on position because if

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.749 
leaving in an on position because if
your<00:01:55.290> trigger<00:01:55.560> gets<00:01:55.799> held<00:01:56.009> down<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> throw

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
your trigger gets held down if you throw

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.010 
your trigger gets held down if you throw
it<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:56.969> toy<00:01:57.180> bin<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.479> whatever<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> if

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it in your toy bin or whatever and if

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.359 
it in your toy bin or whatever and if
your<00:01:58.140> trigger<00:01:58.380> goes<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.130> kill

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
your trigger goes down you will kill

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069 
your trigger goes down you will kill
your<00:01:59.490> batteries<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.390> keeping<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.899> off

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
your batteries so keeping you in the off

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
your batteries so keeping you in the off
position<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.619> great<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.520> won't<00:02:02.880> hurt

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
position is great but the on won't hurt

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060 
position is great but the on won't hurt
it<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.479> moving<00:02:03.719> further<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.170> there's<00:02:04.920> two

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it and moving further back there's two

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.679 
it and moving further back there's two
stock<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.790> pretty<00:02:06.000> cool<00:02:06.210> stock<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
think it looks nice it's the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
strike looking grip back here it's very

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.830 
strike looking grip back here it's very
comfortable<00:02:10.489> I'm<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:11.000> pretty<00:02:11.299> big<00:02:11.540> guy<00:02:11.689> I'm

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840

teeny means and it's pretty comfortable

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.470 
teeny means and it's pretty comfortable
that's<00:02:16.069> definitely<00:02:16.430> too<00:02:16.549> short<00:02:16.879> for<00:02:16.939> me<00:02:17.180> but<00:02:17.450> I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
that's definitely too short for me but I

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.059 
that's definitely too short for me but I
wouldn't<00:02:17.810> really<00:02:17.959> want<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.769> like<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
wouldn't really want it to be like a

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.399 
wouldn't really want it to be like a
real<00:02:19.280> gun<00:02:19.569> because<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.780> nerf<00:02:20.930> gun<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
real gun because it's a nerf gun and

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.839 
real gun because it's a nerf gun and
it's<00:02:21.530> nice<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:22.159> able<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.340> do<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.610> or

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
it's nice to be able to do this or

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.970 
it's nice to be able to do this or
whatever<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:23.870> also<00:02:24.019> removable<00:02:24.620> which<00:02:24.859> i

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
whatever and it's also removable which i

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.349 
whatever and it's also removable which i
think<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.280> pretty<00:02:25.489> cool<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.239> the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
think is pretty cool if you can see the

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.030 
think is pretty cool if you can see the
orange<00:02:26.599> switch<00:02:26.900> here<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.680> pull<00:02:27.920> that

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
orange switch here you just pull that

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.319 
orange switch here you just pull that
back<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.549> just<00:02:28.730> pull<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> stock

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
back and then you just pull the stock

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.880 
back and then you just pull the stock
back<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.840> pops<00:02:30.019> right<00:02:30.140> out<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:30.739> pretty

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
back and it pops right out it's pretty

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.710 
back and it pops right out it's pretty
cool<00:02:31.189> there<00:02:31.730> are<00:02:31.849> two<00:02:32.030> little<00:02:32.329> locking

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
cool there are two little locking

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.780 
cool there are two little locking
systems<00:02:33.079> here<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:34.099> I'm<00:02:34.220> sure<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.760> you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
systems here and here I'm sure if you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.009 
systems here and here I'm sure if you
gave<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.030> enough<00:02:35.329> force<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:35.720> could<00:02:35.840> pull<00:02:35.989> it

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
gave it enough force you could pull it

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.780 
gave it enough force you could pull it
out<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.379> me<00:02:36.560> Wow<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.099> using<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.519> but<00:02:37.760> I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
out with me Wow and using this but I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.640 
out with me Wow and using this but I
wouldn't<00:02:38.000> recommend<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.599> just<00:02:39.379> because

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
wouldn't recommend it just because

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.410 
wouldn't recommend it just because
that's<00:02:39.829> really<00:02:40.220> easy<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:41.030> it's<00:02:41.269> pretty

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
that's really easy I think it's pretty

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.020 
that's really easy I think it's pretty
cool<00:02:41.720> if<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.079> need<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.769> mean<00:02:43.370> travel<00:02:43.849> with

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
cool if you need to I mean travel with

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.059 
cool if you need to I mean travel with
it<00:02:44.299> like<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.840> don't<00:02:44.959> know<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.680> still<00:02:45.920> pretty

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
it like a I don't know it's still pretty

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.830 
it like a I don't know it's still pretty
cool<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.639> for<00:02:47.269> storage<00:02:47.629> especially

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
cool to have for storage especially

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.140 
cool to have for storage especially
because<00:02:48.409> I<00:02:48.769> store<00:02:49.310> all<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.519> my<00:02:49.639> blasters<00:02:50.120> and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
because I store all of my blasters and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.720 
because I store all of my blasters and
little<00:02:50.420> crates<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.379> it<00:02:51.709> now<00:02:51.829> fits<00:02:52.099> much<00:02:52.370> easier

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
little crates so it now fits much easier

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.089

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
color scheme I'm really a big fan of the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.390 
color scheme I'm really a big fan of the
yellow<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.840> is<00:02:59.989> obviously<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.950> same<00:03:00.980> line

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
yellow this is obviously the same line

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.910 
yellow this is obviously the same line
as<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.730> Kwik<00:03:02.629> 16<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.319> did<00:03:03.500> do<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.680> video

if you want to see that but the paint
job<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.609> same<00:03:07.639> and<00:03:08.090> they<00:03:08.510> also<00:03:08.659> have<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
job is the same and they also have the

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.379 
job is the same and they also have the
theme<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.739> entire<00:03:10.099> yellow<00:03:10.549> piece<00:03:10.909> here

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
theme of this entire yellow piece here

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.449 
theme of this entire yellow piece here
is<00:03:11.540> actually<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.349> separate<00:03:12.859> piece<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.340> they

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
is actually a separate piece so they

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.099 
is actually a separate piece so they
painted<00:03:13.849> this<00:03:14.000> separately<00:03:14.480> than<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.840> rest<00:03:15.019> of

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
painted this separately than the rest of

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.689 
painted this separately than the rest of
the<00:03:15.230> blasters<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:15.889> it's<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.280> perfectly

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
the blasters so it's a perfectly

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.309 
the blasters so it's a perfectly
straight<00:03:17.150> wiring<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.720> there's<00:03:17.870> no<00:03:18.019> paint

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
straight wiring and there's no paint

straight wiring and there's no paint
smearing<00:03:18.769> I'm<00:03:19.129> pretty<00:03:19.489> picky<00:03:19.730> when<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.060> comes

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
smearing I'm pretty picky when it comes

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.360 
smearing I'm pretty picky when it comes
to<00:03:20.329> paint<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.720> did<00:03:20.930> rip<00:03:21.169> apart<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.560> long<00:03:21.949> strike

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
to paint I did rip apart the long strike

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.339 
to paint I did rip apart the long strike
never<00:03:22.970> been<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> real<00:03:23.389> fan<00:03:23.629> of<00:03:23.780> some<00:03:23.959> of<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.109> old

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
never been a real fan of some of the old

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.110 
never been a real fan of some of the old
long<00:03:24.590> shots<00:03:24.889> within<00:03:25.159> the<00:03:25.459> bipod<00:03:25.849> area

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
long shots within the bipod area

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.119 
long shots within the bipod area
especially<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:27.139> paint<00:03:27.379> machines<00:03:27.739> would<00:03:27.949> just

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
especially the paint machines would just

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.189 
especially the paint machines would just
mess<00:03:28.310> up<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.669> stuff<00:03:28.879> this<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.419> a<00:03:29.569> very<00:03:29.870> clean

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
mess up and stuff this is a very clean

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.930 
mess up and stuff this is a very clean
back<00:03:30.440> blaster<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.280> really<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:31.730> how<00:03:31.879> it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
back blaster and I really like how it

looks<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.659> is<00:03:32.720> part<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.169> dark<00:03:33.379> tagline

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.170 
looks this is part of the dark tagline
which<00:03:34.069> is<00:03:34.250> different<00:03:34.609> than<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.790> inch<00:03:34.940> strike

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
which is different than the inch strike

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.629 
which is different than the inch strike

comfortable as well awaited even with

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
the batteries in but it's not really

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.409 
the batteries in but it's not really
much<00:04:09.949> to<00:04:10.159> worry<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.579> if<00:04:10.940> you're<00:04:11.180> fine<00:04:11.389> with

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
much to worry about if you're fine with

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.330 
much to worry about if you're fine with
a<00:04:11.599> stampede<00:04:12.169> this<00:04:12.709> is<00:04:12.859> gonna<00:04:13.010> be<00:04:13.190> better

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
a stampede this is gonna be better

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.490 
a stampede this is gonna be better
because<00:04:13.639> it's<00:04:13.909> lighter<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.629> C<00:04:14.840> batteries<00:04:15.260> are

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500
