unique species will find the Kestrel is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.820 
unique species will find the Kestrel is
the<00:00:21.480> only<00:00:21.660> bird<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.080> prey<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> planet<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the only bird of prey on the planet that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
the only bird of prey on the planet that
could<00:00:22.980> hover<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> whenever<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.990> little

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
could hover so whenever you see a little

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.509 
could hover so whenever you see a little
bird<00:00:25.289> fluttering<00:00:25.769> above<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> hedgerow<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
bird fluttering above a hedgerow on the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
bird fluttering above a hedgerow on the
side<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> motorway<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:28.140> almost

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
side of the motorway it's almost

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.660 
side of the motorway it's almost
definitely<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.949> Kestrel

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
definitely a Kestrel

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
definitely a Kestrel
I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> by

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I think the way which they do this is by

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.900 
I think the way which they do this is by
rolling<00:00:31.890> their<00:00:32.040> wings<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.430> sort<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> figure

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
rolling their wings in a sort of figure

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.130 
rolling their wings in a sort of figure
of<00:00:33.000> eight<00:00:33.149> movement<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:33.780> using<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of eight movement and then using that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.459 
of eight movement and then using that
big<00:00:34.410> long<00:00:34.620> Falcon<00:00:35.130> tail<00:00:35.540> just<00:00:36.540> sort<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> flat

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
big long Falcon tail just sort of flat

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.110 
big long Falcon tail just sort of flat
really<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.980> an<00:00:38.040> extra<00:00:38.340> wing<00:00:38.489> almost<00:00:38.940> when

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
really it's an extra wing almost when

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
really it's an extra wing almost when
they're<00:00:39.270> hungry<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.840> their<00:00:40.079> winds<00:00:40.320> strong

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
they're hungry if their winds strong

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
they're hungry if their winds strong
enough<00:00:40.940> you'll<00:00:41.940> find<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.329> he<00:00:42.480> will

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
enough you'll find that he will

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.610 
enough you'll find that he will
certainly<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.079> able<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> keep<00:00:43.440> himself

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
certainly be able to keep himself

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.729 
certainly be able to keep himself
suspended<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:45.360> know<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> by<00:00:45.840> locking<00:00:46.620> his

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
suspended you know just by locking his

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
suspended you know just by locking his
wings<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.160> place<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> keep<00:00:47.730> his<00:00:47.910> his<00:00:48.270> tail

fan<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.289> making<00:00:49.469> sure<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.980> he

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
fan in and out making sure that he

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.150 
fan in and out making sure that he
stayed<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> same<00:00:50.670> position<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> say

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
stayed in the same position but I say

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.260 
stayed in the same position but I say
you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.969> he's<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you can see that you know he's very

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.819 
you can see that you know he's very
flighty<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.930> nippy<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.230> bird<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> mean

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
flighty very nippy little bird I mean

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319 
flighty very nippy little bird I mean
just<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.340> he's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> smaller<00:00:56.910> fall<00:00:57.180> team

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
just because he's a smaller fall team

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
just because he's a smaller fall team
doesn't<00:00:57.510> mean<00:00:57.660> he's<00:00:57.750> any<00:00:57.840> less<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:59.010> terms<00:00:59.190> of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
doesn't mean he's any less in terms of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.250 
doesn't mean he's any less in terms of
speed<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> likes<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> his<00:01:00.629> bigger<00:01:00.809> cousins

only being six and a quarter ounces of
course<00:01:11.970> he<00:01:12.060> hasn't<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> capability<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
course he hasn't got the capability of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
course he hasn't got the capability of
stupid<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.830> diving<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.340> these<00:01:14.490> bigger

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
stupid and diving like these bigger

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
stupid and diving like these bigger
cousins<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.810> birds<00:01:16.049> will<00:01:16.290> do

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to kill with their beak in a unique way

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.929 
to kill with their beak in a unique way
which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> by<00:01:33.509> snapping<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.020> neck<00:01:34.880> sort<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
which is by snapping your neck sort of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.749 
which is by snapping your neck sort of
like<00:01:36.119> half<00:01:37.049> way<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
like half way down there there so if you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.740 
like half way down there there so if you
have<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> look<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.119> how<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> might<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.600> able<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
have a look at how you might be able to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
have a look at how you might be able to
see<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.110> his<00:01:40.470> beak<00:01:40.710> isn't<00:01:40.890> smooth<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
see that is his beak isn't smooth and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.710 
see that is his beak isn't smooth and
the<00:01:41.640> top<00:01:41.820> mandible<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.270> sort<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> slightly

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the top mandible it's sort of slightly

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.889 
the top mandible it's sort of slightly
ridged<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.159> rigid<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
ridged it's like rigid and and that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.420 
ridged it's like rigid and and that
effectively<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.560> fit<00:01:46.799> perfectly<00:01:47.009> in

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
effectively will fit perfectly in

reason why they see ultraviolet light is

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360 
reason why they see ultraviolet light is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
to see rodents urine because rodents

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.690 
to see rodents urine because rodents
urine<00:02:36.930> reflects<00:02:37.470> ultraviolet<00:02:37.950> light<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.580> what
