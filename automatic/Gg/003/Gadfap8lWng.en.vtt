00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.540
 and there personal everything beauty here speaks lech 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.750
 and the next I'll do the second here 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.420
 video lesson that the third plays a case 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.850
 I'm going to teach you how to use the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 extinguisher that serves everything else 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.189
 Let's get better at sting is a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 network of games for pc also works 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.880
 if you use it to access it in the test but 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.770
 does not have psdb so i play for the third one 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.980
 The first one you do not have to do is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.430
 get into a phishing site I will 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 leave the registration link obviously 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 but you enter a site from and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.489
 Put it down and I'll show it from here. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.120
 and you can download the file 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.680
 likely to enter a room without 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.750
 change but only until a little bit I think 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 that everyone has already spoken here and he can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.230
 You were stinging. 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 I think it runs on any pc but the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.250
 problem is that there is no problem 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.350
 problem 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.390
 the function is round games 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.390
 Then you have here and you will have the program 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.820
 sorry 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.189
 I had to stop the videotape a little bit 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.330
 continuing here this did a later 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.640
 install extinct 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.829
 As I said the games are that tests on the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.320
 zombie computer in which they will want a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:48.990
 account a new account 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:53.939
 but I have a team that plays again 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 see you guys, I came back 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:06.180
 So we're open here and now. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:13.890
 its a certain system skype 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:17.250
 down the boot the a3 to the forum 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.490
 I think in today's peace game 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.660
 god mode has several games here can 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.610
 see here have some releases 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.610
 here you have promotions 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.000
 mailing and he does many promotions or 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:39.630
 some games with raining deals 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.940
 cuba is the 50% revolution at 2 and 50 and 49 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.370
 that is to say the partner milk launched is in 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.489
 promotion the door the 2nd door to 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.830
 importer that I can abandon the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.290
 technip portal show me later 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.980
 this is the logic is every man of 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.470
 sting 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.840
 hence the library where the games where 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.140
 you were also working that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.140
 because of that it is well 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.830
 isolated game technician that I have 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.580
 two pcs that I do not use and get a lot 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:19.140
 in all the games I have here is e 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.299

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.140
 games here 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.810
 most of the paid action games 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.390
 if you make a statement it happens game 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.390
 ask me that I say everything else 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.980
 but if you want to see a game only 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:58.640

00:03:37.980 --> 00:04:01.380

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.650
 of the play and sometimes have games at last 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.560
 weekend is free game 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.769
 today I'm in soccer law means 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.049
 free to play here in front play 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.630
 I have some free-to-play games I 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.539
 I like very much 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:23.099
 I have to see that this game that is 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.660
 heavy and lose weight but I do not recommend 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.630
 I do not know what's in the game yet 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.860
 but this game here here as I play 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.040
 he is good , he is cool he 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.270
 he remembers a little of the field of the titans 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:43.590
 play 2 if you know but he has more 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.840
 weapons and more from the universe of 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.870
 games that only you look for one of the 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.640
 better now I'm throwing myself here more 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.250
 popular are team fortress 2 which is a 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.160
 best fps game that my life one of 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.440
 better not 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.200
 he is very funny and fun to play 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.650
 well being also has the air frame that a 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.480
 third person game and lethal shot and 2 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.780
 that takes a lot for the passion in the 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.540
 internet that entered the game to star 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.890
 Your universe's online trek was played 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.910
 which also in the middle of the dinho 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.200
 I recommend that they are not too heavy or 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.930
 six teams to haiti and is dangerous 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.680
 The little one I played in then this is the 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.790
 purpose of the stint Veneu of JVC and 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.370
 Either way you're going to have to win. 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.900
 the sardine pro game in the game if you 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.660
 You want to have real fun 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.440
 buy appliance and items and stuff 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.520
 Anyway, I think I'm going to stop here. 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.260
 the video lesson 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.260
 so until the next
