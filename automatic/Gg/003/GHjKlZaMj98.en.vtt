00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.670
 is the minarion where the facade was kept 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.199
 within the requirement of equity 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.699
 artistic history that I already wanted 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.660
 well tucked away from it is a good 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.039
 dropped 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.500
 so we have to adjust to 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.660
 modernity the old structure 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.150
 logically at the time was not built 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.400
 did not have the techniques required by the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.570
 Today's football is the techniques of 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.879
 Construction stadiums 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.910
 we have to get an old house 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.410
 structure and transform it 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.410
 modern a modern arena 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.480
 a very interesting feature 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.300
 this esplanade we have around the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.310
 stadium is a unique project in Brazil not 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690
 you have news of a project with this type 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.820
 of thing is characteristic 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.410
 this gives the whole structure 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.210
 structure of the multipurpose arena 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.390
 flexibility of event type is very 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 great 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.939
 I had no cabins before 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:24.509
 project 98 cabins were created two 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.119
 areas of VIP areas with lounge on 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.039
 rear then make a one concept 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.140
 totally different from football 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.270
 use for the same stadium in the restaurant 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.289
 panoramic view of 1,600 square meters with 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.729
 this is not and the chairs are tools 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.560
 comfortable anywhere 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630
 stadium chair you have an extreme 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.990
 comfort beyond existing 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.299
 certified by the certification seal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.670
 I think I have is a is a modern stadium 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.979
 stadium everybody think we're not 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.729
 now the mineral owes nothing to any 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.729
 world stadium 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.150
 were also investigated higher 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.310

 for relationship with the games in 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.520
 reservation bank and got zhu with 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.290
 Make hair comfortable so I guess 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.130
 what is everyone here this stadium is 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.170

 the military police elements that we do not 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.319
 we will have the partnership extremely 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.879
 important within the stadium even because 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.170

 Professional snack bar placements 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.950
 in the bathroom 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.989
 the position of his desk chair despite 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.269
 were already allowed to enter the stadium 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.609
 very guided where they will sit 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.919
 not having the ticket but always each 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.840
 that last checked everything in the last 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.459
 time to if everything is really sitting 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.459
 just place and be very important 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.600
 but both the unit started from the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.670
 beginning of the work not all materials here 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.260
 was maintained to maintain this demolition of the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.900
 old general everything was demolished was 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.850
 recycled concrete suppression 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.100
 the trees were cut too. 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.950
 were given to the most informed 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.530
 gave her a treatment also a 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.680
 the purpose of this wood which was 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.560
 the plant inspection and ends today with 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.590
 the solar power plant and over the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 reuse of water is the whole issue of 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.140
 certify that this work is 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.670
 being they all kept singing 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.709
 certified leed 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.930
 so I think he acted in that respect. 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.450
 also loves me and not the lesson to us all 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.070
 in this work of the summer project of how 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.280
 we can make a sustained egg as 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.500
 we can transform the old one without 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.370
 harming the environment and collaborating with 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.370
 our future generations 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.020
 we will have a very good view of the 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.210
 so that it is not difficult 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.460
 little internet is mostly not 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.470
 these main points the nets bathrooms 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.509
 everything is very organized everything was everything 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.669
