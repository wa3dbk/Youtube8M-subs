the deck the finger should just be

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.959 
the deck the finger should just be
contacting<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> bottom<00:00:49.440> cards<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> deck

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
contacting the bottom cards of the deck

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.639 
contacting the bottom cards of the deck
hanging<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.239> over<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> tiniest<00:00:52.410> bit

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
hanging up over just the tiniest bit

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.459 
hanging up over just the tiniest bit
your<00:00:53.129> thumb<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.579> same<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> cards

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
your thumb the same thing so the cards

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.869 
your thumb the same thing so the cards
are<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.920> coming<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.610> thumb

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
are going to be coming off your thumb

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510 
are going to be coming off your thumb
okay<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> lift

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
okay so what you're going to do is lift

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
okay so what you're going to do is lift
up<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.090> thumb<00:01:00.420> while<00:01:00.780> applying

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
pressure inwards with the thumb and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
pressure inwards with the thumb and
that's<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.379> start<00:01:04.500> releasing<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.549> cards

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that's gonna start releasing the cards

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.880 
that's gonna start releasing the cards
just<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.990> now<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.320> force<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> put

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
just like so now the more force you put

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.920 
just like so now the more force you put
onto<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.939> easily<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> course<00:01:12.780> will

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
onto it then more easily the course will

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.039 
onto it then more easily the course will
detach<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.740> three<00:01:14.130> front<00:01:14.460> fingers<00:01:15.049> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
detach from these three front fingers so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
detach from these three front fingers so
start<00:01:16.409> off<00:01:16.500> by<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.520> lightly<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
start off by going pretty lightly and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
start off by going pretty lightly and
see<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> currents<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
see if the currents come off in a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
see if the currents come off in a
constant<00:01:20.640> stream<00:01:21.110> concentrate<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.259> getting

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
constant stream concentrate on getting

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.399 
constant stream concentrate on getting
one<00:01:23.250> card<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> time<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.259> other

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
hand okay once again just like so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
hand okay once again just like so
concentrate<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.780> getting<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.170> card<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
concentrate on getting one card at a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.149 
concentrate on getting one card at a
time<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.680> better<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
time and then as you get better at it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.319 
time and then as you get better at it
you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> apply<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:36.869> pressure<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:38.180> see<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you can apply more pressure and see the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
you can apply more pressure and see the
cards<00:01:39.600> come<00:01:39.810> off<00:01:39.990> beautifully<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> stream

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
cards come off beautifully as a stream

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.780 
cards come off beautifully as a stream
of<00:01:41.159> cards<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.470> once<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.040> time

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
of cards so once one more time

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.480 
of cards so once one more time
you<00:01:45.210> start<00:01:45.420> off<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.040> try<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.280> one

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
card at a time but once you get more

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
card at a time but once you get more
experienced<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.399> increase<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
experienced then you can increase the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.039 
experienced then you can increase the
height<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.520> speed<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
height and the speed at which you do the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.819 
height and the speed at which you do the
dribble<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.579> attractive<00:01:57.829> parish

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
dribble it's a really attractive parish
