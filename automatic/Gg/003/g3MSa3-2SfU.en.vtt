00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
they're still our life like for example

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.560 
they're still our life like for example
clarence<00:01:45.280> seedorf<00:01:45.609> you<00:01:46.060> see<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.299> manager

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
clarence seedorf you see the manager

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.560 
clarence seedorf you see the manager
right<00:01:46.990> now<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.409> but<00:01:47.950> still<00:01:48.789> in<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.060> game<00:01:49.240> i'm

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
right now and but still in the game i'm

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.450 
right now and but still in the game i'm
guessing<00:01:50.259> they're<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.770> remove<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.100> is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460

do want to want to is very predictable
it's<00:05:19.030> very<00:05:19.210> obvious<00:05:19.659> you're<00:05:20.139> on<00:05:20.259> a<00:05:20.289> player<00:05:20.620> you

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
it's very obvious you're on a player you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.529 
it's very obvious you're on a player you
pass<00:05:21.069> another<00:05:21.370> player<00:05:21.669> makes<00:05:21.909> a<00:05:22.060> run<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.270> can

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
pass another player makes a run I can

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.749 
pass another player makes a run I can
see<00:05:22.720> as<00:05:22.870> predictable<00:05:23.440> as<00:05:23.530> obvious<00:05:23.979> try<00:05:24.520> pass

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
see as predictable as obvious try pass

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.430 
see as predictable as obvious try pass
and<00:05:25.030> move<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.360> less<00:05:25.569> predictable<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.319> know

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
and move is less predictable you know

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.620 
and move is less predictable you know
for<00:05:26.830> example<00:05:26.889> you<00:05:27.340> have<00:05:27.370> two<00:05:27.699> players<00:05:27.849> and<00:05:28.300> as

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
for example you have two players and as

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.689 
for example you have two players and as
you<00:05:28.750> see<00:05:28.930> it<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.319> I've<00:05:29.740> made<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.460> pass<00:05:30.669> and

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
you see it here I've made the pass and

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.459 
you see it here I've made the pass and
move<00:05:31.030> with<00:05:31.180> almost<00:05:31.449> five<00:05:31.780> players<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.409> I

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
move with almost five players and I

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.170 
move with almost five players and I
never<00:05:32.650> gave<00:05:32.889> back<00:05:33.219> to<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.430> player<00:05:33.699> who<00:05:33.880> made<00:05:34.060> the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
never gave back to a player who made the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.640 
never gave back to a player who made the
one<00:05:34.389> just<00:05:34.840> clean<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.229> confuse<00:05:35.620> the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
one just clean it to confuse the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.129 
one just clean it to confuse the
opponent<00:05:36.219> I<00:05:36.340> had<00:05:36.759> four<00:05:37.419> or<00:05:37.599> five<00:05:37.810> players

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
opponent I had four or five players

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.899 
opponent I had four or five players
making<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.590> run<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.250> opponent<00:05:39.639> will<00:05:39.759> get

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
making a run that the opponent will get

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.659 
making a run that the opponent will get
