this<00:00:24.779> transition<00:00:25.349> began<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.779> 1996

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this transition began way back in 1996

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.320 
this transition began way back in 1996
when<00:00:28.289> Congress<00:00:28.830> required<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.519> conversion<00:00:30.119> to

digital broadcasting they did this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180
