00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.759 
could kill at least an hour or maybe two
hours<00:02:53.239> if<00:02:53.840> you're<00:02:53.959> sitting<00:02:54.260> at<00:02:54.349> work<00:02:54.530> doing

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
hours if you're sitting at work doing

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.039 
hours if you're sitting at work doing
nothing<00:02:55.150> because<00:02:56.150> that's<00:02:56.450> what<00:02:56.629> most<00:02:56.810> people

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
nothing because that's what most people

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.000 
nothing because that's what most people
do<00:02:57.169> it<00:02:57.260> work<00:02:57.439> nothing<00:02:59.469> but<00:03:00.469> I<00:03:00.500> figured<00:03:00.889> it'd<00:03:00.980> be

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
do it work nothing but I figured it'd be

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.860 
do it work nothing but I figured it'd be
a<00:03:01.099> vehicle<00:03:01.700> are<00:03:01.879> a<00:03:01.909> timewaster<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.599> guess<00:03:02.750> I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
a vehicle are a timewaster I guess I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.240 
a vehicle are a timewaster I guess I
timed<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.349> wrong<00:03:03.530> i<00:03:03.739> think<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:04.069> video

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
timed it wrong i think that video

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.369 
timed it wrong i think that video
probably<00:03:04.430> will<00:03:04.639> get<00:03:04.790> better<00:03:04.969> but<00:03:05.840> over<00:03:06.200> better

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
probably will get better but over better

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.990 
probably will get better but over better
if<00:03:06.620> i<00:03:06.739> put<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.129> out<00:03:07.219> like<00:03:07.430> early<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:07.909> the
