snug-fitting<00:00:41.309> love<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.200> expected<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.770> would

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
snug-fitting love as I expected it would

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.959 
snug-fitting love as I expected it would
be<00:00:44.059> they<00:00:45.059> use<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> latex<00:00:46.520> gusset<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> glove

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
be they use a latex gusset in the glove

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
be they use a latex gusset in the glove
which<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.469> best<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.129> me<00:00:50.250> when<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> comes

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
which is the best for me when it comes

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
which is the best for me when it comes
to<00:00:51.090> negative<00:00:51.930> cut<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> much

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to negative cut it just get that much

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
to negative cut it just get that much
tighter<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> fits<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.289> much<00:00:55.410> better

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
tighter and it fits that much better

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
tighter and it fits that much better
than<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.219> mess<00:00:57.090> latex<00:00:57.800> mesh<00:00:58.800> gusset<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.460> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
than the mess latex mesh gusset was to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.470 
than the mess latex mesh gusset was to
really<00:01:01.020> key<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.489> it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
really key on that really like it it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
really key on that really like it it's
quite<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> wide<00:01:03.930> strap<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
quite a wide strap on it again but it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.390 
quite a wide strap on it again but it
gives<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.450> does<00:01:06.810> give<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> nice<00:01:07.260> finish<00:01:07.680> fits

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
gives it does give a nice finish fits

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.660 
gives it does give a nice finish fits
really<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:09.090> well<00:01:09.270> they've<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.229> this
