00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good family welcome back to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.240
 channel that you render good like me in the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.560
 video I bring this look I want a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.210
 bunch up it's a place if ya 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.110
 colorful because the heat starts to me 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 released and it is to put color in my eyes 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 appears behind this combination in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.510
 tropical plan is Carlos and how to call it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 she is more using one of the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
 palettes that had not released the sleep 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 which is to kill me specifically the one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 snapshots I do not know if you learn but let's go 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.769
 It is a super colorful palette for this 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 summer and that is perfect to be able 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 make some pretty colorful looks and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.350
 active I leave you with the video other 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 lip options as you see this is in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 the option new but has also been left 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.200
 an option in fuchsia tone with both for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 which is a bit how the look can look 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.329
 accompanying him with new powerful lips 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.379
 so I have a lot more to tell you 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.910
 I hope you like the video that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.620
 you deserve comments down here with 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 your opinion what is always 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 also 6 and what you want 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.949
 we started well then let's go there 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.410
 use a test is for eyes in this 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.510
 this is the case of to face the shadow 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 insurance you already know that I like a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.070
 pile so that the shadows remain 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.290
 more time 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.050
 so that the color is better appreciated 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.360
 I'll start with the shade of Jean in 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.720
 this case of the 808 and as you see with a 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 Dot brush to blur finishes a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.030
 little bit in tip I'm going to mark me all the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030
 basin 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.249
 As you can see I am doing movements of 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.369
 zig zag simply to go dialing 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:33.740
 because as you can see when finishing in tip 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.780
 is leaving the line that I look for in 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.640
 concrete in the basin but it is true 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.719
 that at the same time it diffused very well like this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.429
 that's why I'm doing those 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.959
 zig zag movements the only thing I'm going 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.240
 to do is close a little bit as you see 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.929
 in the external ub to close a little bit 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.929
 Basin 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.490
 and I'm going to stretch it a little towards the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.140
 outside to blur it at the same time and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 do a little bit the look more 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.360
 torn 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.009
 I'm going to continue with that orange shadow that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.080
 You see, it's beautiful because it has a halo 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.690
 golden that I love seems super 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.460
 pretty for summer this warmth 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.489
 that comes to us and as well the only thing that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.120
 I do is fill the mobile eyelid that 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.280
 was left 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.379
 without any shadow like and I'm going 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 depositing little taps and I'm going 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.640
 integrating with the basin that I have made 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.739
 before to continue doing the same 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.409
 I work in the lower part of the eye, 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.280
 to review a little the animal and the area 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.280
 lower eyelash 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.470
 and I'm going to finish marking the basin 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.340
 with that fuchsia pink shadow that you see there 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.599
 because it gives a warmth to the basin 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.569
 tremendous and I love it very much 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.209
 effect that leaves because it is not pink is 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.660
 as reddish so it gives a warmth 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.069
 incredible to the look as you see but what 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.340
 yes i will do it is with the same shadow 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.620
 of jean from before and the same little brooch 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 to mark me the external ub as because it's 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.720
 a shade much more eggplant which 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.840
 It makes it much better to mark 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.790
 extreme outer zone of the eye lose like this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.980
 that as you can see leaves an eye very well 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.849
 marked and I really like the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.849
 transition that creates 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.100
 well I will continue and finish look 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.350
 illuminating the arch of the eyebrows as 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.850
 you see that shadow there used that 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.560
 palette in its entirety because there is also 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.050
 a beige transition shade 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.209
 beautiful too and the only thing to do 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.780
 now with that creamy black pencil I'm going to 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.690
 Fill 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.120
 both water lines and with a pincelito 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.150
 fine taking advantage that it is very creamy I'm going 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.100
 to blur a tad as you see the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.100
 lines both above and below 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.720
 we use lashes I will go through with the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.670
 in this case was mascara mask 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.010
 essence that you know I love because 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.290
 it leaves my eyelashes that good those of 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.819
 Eyelashes are eyelashes because they are left 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.099
 with a lot of volume and very black and 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.590
 love we are going to spend with the face in 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.170
 this case one of my favorite combos the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.870
 fixed base covered in mixed deliplus 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.920
 with copacabana de nars I mix it a 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.170
 bit good then a hand where 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.650
 you can and I apply it with a 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.959
 wet bible as you see and I'm applying 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.169
 to touch this makes me leave an effect 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.430
 super blur of this base and I like it 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.620
 very much the luminosity that opens 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.630
 copacabana as you see I am simply going to 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.610
 touch up a little dark circles with the therma 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.820
 vichy blend because you already know that it covers 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.760
 perfectly so to avoid dark circles 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.830
 I do it with it, I'm going to mark those with 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.889
 the translucent powders of that in this 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.820
 I have already started using the compacts 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.650
 and well at the moment they are not going 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.300
 nothing bad I like the finite ones that are 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.770
 I'm going to outline my face a little 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.780
 with the lagoons 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.490
 not a very exaggerated thing 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.639
 simply at the beginning of the cheekbone to 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.720
 mark your face a little and blur 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.000
 very well 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
 I'm going to apply that blusher of Milan and in 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.650
 this case is the rose d'or that have the 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.080
 incredible university that you do not know what 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.760
 than what it brings to the skin and light that 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.040
 it looks but as I really like the 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.140
 blow skin I am faithful to my illuminator 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.770
 of ethnicity which is that it is gorgeous 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.240
 really 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.540
 I insist you have to see it live 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.670
 because the first option is amazing 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.650
 of lipstick is this that I will leave you in the 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.780
 information box all the number and 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.800
 of everything I use but as you see 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.860
 it's a tone 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.500
 jude de l'orÃ©al good for a look 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.320
 a little bit softer so to speak and 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.660
 I give you a second option in this case 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.880
 with this fuchsia lipstick of ethnicity is the 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.720
 number 26 of the new Samoan collection 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.950
 good as you see also gives that touch 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.330
 cool and power environment that we like 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.830
 we in summer I hope that I have 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.210
 I really liked this look, leave me 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.680
 comments down here and see you 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.680
 in the next video chao
