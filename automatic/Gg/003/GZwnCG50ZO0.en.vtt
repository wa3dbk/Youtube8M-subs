00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.940
 great demand returns with the m1 irons e 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.280
 that you asked me to try after 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.240
 first veteran mode but look at that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.490
 map I ended up on campers 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 legs that will practically be the children 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.029
 let's start right away that grenade launches is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.029
 just like a real professional 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.920
 so why did I put my sights on it 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.350
 to whom over we give good killed 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:52.490
 or I ate a little Achilles 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:55.110
 I ate one so they have qua.no 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:01.710
 gabion stood in front of damn 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.050
 you wind my mom 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.750
 with the viewfinder and with the rifling is 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.670
 devastating star but with the figline the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.570
 rifling is much more interesting than star 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.570
 my beautiful mom 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.580
 gi 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.010
 my mom who was making this visa 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.310
 what reload was one from the corner 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 after another thrown on the ground 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:08.760
 fruit coffee fruit camper fan 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:10.500
 old man killed ok age than from one 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.690
 charging ship under the juggler 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.220
 because the magician has run out 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.890
 we could get better 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.890
 but then we put on the enemies 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:29.230
 no it doesn't get there 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:34.239

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.129
 the viewfinder 38 was a little difficult 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.390
 but his dirty figure did not understand 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:03:00.090
 because he is not dead but his dirty but 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:07.680
 it 's not a corner 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.840
 slowly I slowly know that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.420
 we have it above the skull above 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.420

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.099
 that I did to the one with the sac that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:30.459
 I did the one with the bags and come on 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:33.189

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:42.540

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:46.379

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.379

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 grenade launcher started shooting 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:14.430

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:27.139

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:27.139

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:52.160

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:56.500
 still that phenomena that sits old 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.770
