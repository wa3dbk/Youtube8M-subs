first ever video blog just yesterday I

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.850 
first ever video blog just yesterday I
actually<00:00:18.520> decided<00:00:19.079> that<00:00:20.079> I<00:00:20.110> wanted<00:00:20.650> to<00:00:20.740> become

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
actually decided that I wanted to become

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.640 
actually decided that I wanted to become
a<00:00:21.039> vegan<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.759> I<00:00:22.570> didn't<00:00:23.020> want<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.259> do<00:00:23.410> for<00:00:23.619> a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
a vegan and I didn't want to do for a

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.120 
a vegan and I didn't want to do for a
long<00:00:23.800> time<00:00:24.160> now<00:00:25.150> but<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.869> actually<00:00:26.200> never

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
long time now but I actually never

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.740 
long time now but I actually never
thought<00:00:27.489> that<00:00:27.700> I'd<00:00:27.820> be<00:00:27.849> able<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.329> do<00:00:28.629> it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
thought that I'd be able to do it

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.010 
thought that I'd be able to do it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
good and I've been a vegetarian for

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.709 
good and I've been a vegetarian for
almost<00:00:50.289> four<00:00:50.589> years<00:00:50.620> now<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:52.480> actually

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
almost four years now and I actually

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.410 
almost four years now and I actually
decided<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.739> become<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.069> just<00:00:54.370> hearing<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.359> I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
decided to become a just hearing and I

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.180 
decided to become a just hearing and I
was<00:00:55.629> 12<00:00:55.929> years<00:00:56.079> old<00:00:56.319> and<00:00:57.749> is<00:00:58.749> a<00:00:59.530> kind<00:01:00.100> of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
was 12 years old and is a kind of

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.889 
was 12 years old and is a kind of
difficult<00:01:00.699> decision<00:01:01.089> for<00:01:01.120> me<00:01:01.420> since<00:01:01.690> my

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
difficult decision for me since my

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.670 
difficult decision for me since my
favorite<00:01:02.229> foods<00:01:02.469> were<00:01:02.829> like<00:01:03.670> fish<00:01:04.620> kind<00:01:05.620> of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
favorite foods were like fish kind of

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.410 
favorite foods were like fish kind of
weird<00:01:05.950> for<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.159> twelve-year-old<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.850> love<00:01:07.060> fish

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
weird for a twelve-year-old to love fish

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.690 
weird for a twelve-year-old to love fish
but<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:08.049> was<00:01:08.680> like<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.950> repeating<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:11.700> I'm

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
but I was like a repeating that and I'm

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.240 
but I was like a repeating that and I'm
just<00:01:12.909> taking<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.300> next<00:01:13.480> step<00:01:13.750> up<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:14.290> don't

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
just taking the next step up I don't

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.740 
just taking the next step up I don't
look<00:01:15.370> in<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.790> way<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.030> animals<00:01:16.450> are<00:01:16.570> treated

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
look in the way that animals are treated

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.300 
look in the way that animals are treated
I<00:01:17.230> mean<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:20.170> don't<00:01:20.500> agree<00:01:20.590> with<00:01:20.770> idea<00:01:21.190> of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
I mean I just don't agree with idea of

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.730 
I mean I just don't agree with idea of
killing<00:01:21.490> an<00:01:21.730> animal<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.690> for<00:01:22.930> eating<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.590> was

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
killing an animal and for eating it was

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.220 
killing an animal and for eating it was
completely<00:01:24.220> unnecessary<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.810> can<00:01:25.930> get<00:01:26.080> the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
completely unnecessary you can get the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.140 
completely unnecessary you can get the
nutrients<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:26.980> everything<00:01:27.400> from<00:01:27.850> other

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
nutrients and everything from other

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.490 
nutrients and everything from other
sources<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:31.300> just<00:01:31.540> seems<00:01:31.810> like<00:01:32.050> pointless

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
sources and it just seems like pointless

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
sources and it just seems like pointless
lives<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:33.390> mean<00:01:34.390> if<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> average<00:01:36.490> person

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
lives I mean if for the average person

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.220 
lives I mean if for the average person
who<00:01:38.170> eats<00:01:38.410> meat<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:39.790> kill<00:01:40.120> 95<00:01:40.600> animals<00:01:41.050> each

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
who eats meat they kill 95 animals each

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.380 
who eats meat they kill 95 animals each
year<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.280> think<00:01:42.640> about<00:01:42.730> this<00:01:42.850> if<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.300> ever

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
year so think about this if you ever

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.690 
year so think about this if you ever
become<00:01:43.540> vegetarian<00:01:44.320> now<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:45.430> I'm<00:01:45.580> just

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
become vegetarian now and I'm just

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.650 
become vegetarian now and I'm just
assuming<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.210> you're<00:01:46.360> not<00:01:46.450> vegetarian

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
assuming that you're not vegetarian

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.870 
assuming that you're not vegetarian
already<00:01:47.580> you'd<00:01:48.580> be<00:01:48.670> saving<00:01:48.940> 95<00:01:49.750> wives<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.880> think

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
already you'd be saving 95 wives I think

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.150 
already you'd be saving 95 wives I think
that's<00:01:52.000> pretty<00:01:52.180> significant<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:54.120> I<00:01:56.160> just

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
that's pretty significant and I just

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.410 
that's pretty significant and I just
want<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.490> be<00:01:57.610> able<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.910> have<00:01:58.000> more<00:01:58.240> control

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
want to be able to have more control

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.440 
want to be able to have more control
over<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.200> stuff<00:01:59.860> I've<00:02:00.040> got<00:02:00.280> my<00:02:00.430> body<00:02:00.670> because

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
over the stuff I've got my body because

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.270 
over the stuff I've got my body because
it's<00:02:01.750> kind<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.020> disgusting<00:02:02.530> when<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.070> think

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
it's kind of disgusting when you think

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's kind of disgusting when you think
of<00:02:03.370> it<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:04.030> put<00:02:04.210> like

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
of it to put like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.899 
of it to put like
another<00:02:05.810> hand<00:02:06.049> once<00:02:06.530> your<00:02:06.740> potty<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.310> don't

another hand once your potty I don't

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.759

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
now it's my second day and I've been

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.780 
now it's my second day and I've been
doing<00:02:16.280> pretty<00:02:16.489> well<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:18.310> my<00:02:19.310> mom<00:02:19.489> really

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
doing pretty well on it my mom really

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.479 
doing pretty well on it my mom really
doesn't<00:02:20.120> want<00:02:20.269> me<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.599> become<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.930> deacon

doesn't want me to become a deacon

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.250 
doesn't want me to become a deacon
because<00:02:22.489> she<00:02:22.670> thinks<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.330> I'm<00:02:23.630> still<00:02:23.989> grown
