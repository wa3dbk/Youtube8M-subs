00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.140
 I really liked reto caffi 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.780
 I also came down earlier 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 played there were no stomping 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.170
 For example, and I think it's right 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.210
 cool for beginners really cool me 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.739
 I played it in my girlfriend and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.120
 I'm just come in and it 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.540
 just makes fun and I will tomorrow 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.540
 drive 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.890
 the dynamic levels around the level 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.200
 always move around as or there's 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.630
 always something new always new things too 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.370
 discover and level the world 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.140
 have seen the differ 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.050
 also from each other as there are quite 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.890
 much variety 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.890
 it's really fun 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.090
 great mario for the times and played it 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.210
 really has fun we have too 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.490
 much played in the co- op mode and we 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.480
 everyone was able to pick a figure 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.920
 one at mario a rapid or luigi and 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.350
 It really was fun to have one 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.740
 level played through and very good 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.570
 made 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.540
 super easy into the gameplay that's great 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.480
 Mario 3d World is missing fun here 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.490
 make fun was great 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.920
 lovingly designed and the character 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.800
 simply different a graphic was really cool 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.810
 So great for the party already 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.970
 Let's see how was too much to do with 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.210
 a variety is so suitable to continue 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.210
 recommend 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.000
 I already played on zelda hd and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.890
 The graphics have improved a lot 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.230
 and otherwise plays the game player 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.400
 pretty good 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.319
 I thought it was great that was definitely 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.849
 the graves were composed in comparison 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.519
 to the predecessor so of course 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.680
 great was really sharp new effects 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.879
 also there are shadows over the march 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.879
 and that's great 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.530
 I just got the legend of Zelda 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.510
 left's played with a lot of heart and with 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.820
 especially the jumping very well 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.410
 had such cute little buttons and 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.730
 her husband could jump to another level 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.450
 which is much deeper in the game 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.450
 has brought 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.750
 I'm pretty good at getting in 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.130
 then a newspaper can transform 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.990
 there are many new possibilities in there 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.430
 open to ressel and i'm very happy 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.880
 curious even if I implement that too 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.050
 becomes 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.010
 I can not wait for the game 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.010
 to ask yourself 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.710
 is alluded to grass monex and must 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:03.560
 say that they are enthusiastic 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.570
 the 3d graphics have made the 3d 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.680
 effect was very very good was extreme 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.320
 impressed 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.070
 the animation in general had a lot too 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.870
 liked 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.580
 I think that will be really damn good 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.180
 So I 'm really happy there 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.180
 extreme 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.270
 i just got professor layton from 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.870
 played abroad 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.879
 and yes I can only say always believe 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.219
 so far, I'm not inferior to its predecessor 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.039
 I would puzzle for a long time as always 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.900
 useful but also exciting and good too 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.159
 to solve 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.030
 yes, what I have seen so far 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.030
 I found that big 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.560
 water rats and that for a long time that 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.180
 The game and the courses are very tricky 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.639
 So I like that is exactly mine 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.479
 style so completely dissatisfied so more than 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.479
 satisfied, better said
