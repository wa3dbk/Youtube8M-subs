00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
going to look better once it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.410 
going to look better once it's
weaponized<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.310> do<00:01:16.430> like<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.090> way<00:01:17.240> that

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
weaponized but I do like the way that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.060 
weaponized but I do like the way that
they<00:01:17.540> took<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.020> classic<00:01:18.380> scheme<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.920> just

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070

they took the classic scheme and just
sort<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.250> modernized<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:19.910> you've<00:01:20.060> got<00:01:20.210> great

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
and that's usually a good thing the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.650 
and that's usually a good thing the
black<00:01:24.410> part<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:25.009> breaks<00:01:25.250> up<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.660> monotony

you can bend the legs at 90 degrees and
that<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.929> ankles<00:01:57.349> are<00:01:57.649> going<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.399> go<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:58.759> over

up<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.910> down<00:02:14.230> similar<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> Novell<00:02:16.310> Gundam

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
up and down similar to the Novell Gundam

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.309 
up and down similar to the Novell Gundam
really<00:02:17.330> there's<00:02:17.510> nothing<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.140> lower

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
really there's nothing that this lower

body can't do except keep the top part
on<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.900> think<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.980> could<00:02:22.220> twist<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.670> thing

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
on I think you could twist this thing

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.559 
on I think you could twist this thing
into<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.090> pretzel

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569

if you chose due to the upper body where
you're<00:02:26.930> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.319> be<00:02:27.410> able<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> spin<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.310> all

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
you're going to be able to spin it all

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.180 
you're going to be able to spin it all
the<00:02:28.849> way<00:02:28.940> around<00:02:29.300> if<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.440> choose<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:31.040> it's

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the way around if you so choose but it's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.229 
the way around if you so choose but it's
more<00:02:31.310> interesting<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.849> you've<00:02:31.970> got<00:02:32.090> that

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
more interesting that you've got that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.420 
more interesting that you've got that
ball<00:02:32.450> joint<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:32.900> inside<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.160> you're

go<00:02:40.520> up<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.970> down<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.930> they<00:02:42.020> can<00:02:42.170> also<00:02:42.290> pivot

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
go up and down and they can also pivot

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.339 
go up and down and they can also pivot
this<00:02:42.860> far<00:02:43.099> forward<00:02:43.520> not<00:02:44.030> very<00:02:44.270> far<00:02:44.510> back<00:02:44.750> but

this far forward not very far back but
the<00:02:45.470> shoulders<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:45.980> spin<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.580> way<00:02:46.819> they<00:02:47.120> can

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
the shoulders can spin this way they can

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.580 
the shoulders can spin this way they can
rotate<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.019> you're<00:02:48.409> going

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
rotate and you're going

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.920 
rotate and you're going
get<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.890> Big<00:02:49.220> Bend<00:02:49.580> here<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.569> could

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
get that Big Bend here so you could

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.140 
get that Big Bend here so you could

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
reach across and he could actually put

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.660 
reach across and he could actually put

and just putting it inside and you'll

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.220 
and just putting it inside and you'll
notice<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.510> you're<00:03:47.690> actually<00:03:47.959> going<00:03:48.110> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.000 
have it's not ripped in there
necessarily<00:03:50.450> but<00:03:51.290> because<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.769> got<00:03:51.890> that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
necessarily but because it's got that

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.289 
necessarily but because it's got that
part<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.489> top<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:52.880> bottom<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.269> just

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
part on the top and the bottom it just

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.479 
part on the top and the bottom it just
seems<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.750> be<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.870> lot<00:03:54.170> more<00:03:54.200> snug<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.160> firm

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.140 
seems to be a lot more snug and firm

than a lot of HG beam rifles can be when

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
it's armed up my initial impression

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.559 
it's armed up my initial impression
doesn't<00:04:00.920> change<00:04:01.130> too<00:04:01.280> much<00:04:01.579> I<00:04:02.090> got<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.359> shield

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
doesn't change too much I got the shield

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.720 
doesn't change too much I got the shield
just<00:04:02.840> here<00:04:03.079> on<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.500> back<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.370> forum<00:04:04.700> just

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
just here on the back of the forum just

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.800 
just here on the back of the forum just
to<00:04:05.000> show<00:04:05.180> how<00:04:05.329> that<00:04:05.389> works

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
to show how that works

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.870 
to show how that works
the<00:04:06.290> dogs<00:04:06.500> rifle<00:04:06.950> again<00:04:07.190> just<00:04:07.430> because<00:04:07.549> it

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
the dogs rifle again just because it

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.910 
the dogs rifle again just because it
fits<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.420> arm<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.049> well<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.440> impressively

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
fits in the arm so well is impressively

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.890 
fits in the arm so well is impressively
impressing<00:04:10.639> me<00:04:10.760> more<00:04:10.910> than<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.120> thought<00:04:11.269> but

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
impressing me more than I thought but

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.240 
impressing me more than I thought but
the<00:04:12.019> fact<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.290> we<00:04:12.440> get<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.680> white<00:04:12.829> blue<00:04:13.069> and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
the fact that we get the white blue and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.220 
the fact that we get the white blue and
gray<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:13.700> certainly<00:04:14.450> good<00:04:14.660> when<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.989> shield

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
gray is certainly good when the shield

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.770 
gray is certainly good when the shield
is<00:04:15.470> facing<00:04:15.889> backwards<00:04:16.370> when<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.269> pop<00:04:17.479> off<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
is facing backwards when you pop off the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.719 
is facing backwards when you pop off the
hand<00:04:17.989> here<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.380> switch<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.859> forearm<00:04:19.190> grip

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
hand here to switch this forearm grip

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.819 
hand here to switch this forearm grip
and<00:04:19.940> put<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.720> shield<00:04:20.959> on<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.380> side<00:04:21.590> you'll

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
and put the shield on to the side you'll

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.900 
and put the shield on to the side you'll
notice<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:22.370> going<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.550> have<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.729> little

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
notice that it's going to have a little

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.879 
notice that it's going to have a little
bit<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.180> trouble<00:04:23.450> just<00:04:23.630> fitting<00:04:24.380> around<00:04:24.500> there

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
bit of trouble just fitting around there

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.390 
bit of trouble just fitting around there
but<00:04:25.550> overall<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.090> effect<00:04:26.419> very<00:04:26.990> rx-78<00:04:27.770> -<00:04:28.190> ish

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
but overall the effect very rx-78 - ish

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.310 
but overall the effect very rx-78 - ish
i<00:04:28.669> don't<00:04:28.849> know<00:04:28.970> what<00:04:29.090> else<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.330> say<00:04:29.570> it's<00:04:30.110> got

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
i don't know what else to say it's got

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.570 
i don't know what else to say it's got
that<00:04:30.410> little<00:04:30.650> bit<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.919> extra<00:04:31.160> there<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
that little bit of extra there in the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.950 
that little bit of extra there in the
place<00:04:31.760> of<00:04:31.789> beam<00:04:32.060> sabers<00:04:32.510> it's<00:04:32.690> got<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
place of beam sabers it's got the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.860 
place of beam sabers it's got the
spoilers<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:34.180> again<00:04:35.180> this<00:04:35.450> is<00:04:35.630> going<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:35.810> be

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
spoilers and again this is going to be

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.120 
spoilers and again this is going to be
in<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> eye<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.320> beholder<00:04:36.500> but<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:36.919> like

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
in the eye of the beholder but I like

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.129 
in the eye of the beholder but I like
the<00:04:37.280> colors<00:04:37.669> of<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.880> shield<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:38.810> dogs

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
the colors of the shield and the dogs

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.260 
the colors of the shield and the dogs
rifle<00:04:39.590> looks<00:04:39.770> good<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.580> so<00:04:40.610> far<00:04:40.940> when<00:04:41.120> it's

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
rifle looks good so so far when it's

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.940 
rifle looks good so so far when it's
hopefully<00:04:41.810> when<00:04:41.930> it's<00:04:42.050> posed<00:04:42.260> well<00:04:42.470> that's

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
hopefully when it's posed well that's

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.110 
hopefully when it's posed well that's
going<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.190> make<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> difference<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:43.849> make<00:04:43.910> this

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
going to make a difference and make this

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.490 
going to make a difference and make this
look<00:04:44.360> even<00:04:44.660> cooler<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.960> start<00:04:48.229> with<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
look even cooler to start with the

the opening sequences they'll have an

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:56.399 
the opening sequences they'll have an
iconic<00:06:54.759> pose<00:06:55.089> and<00:06:55.749> you<00:06:55.839> can<00:06:55.990> think<00:06:56.169> of<00:06:56.229> all

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
iconic pose and you can think of all

iconic pose and you can think of all

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099 
and things like that I wonder what the

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.679 
and things like that I wonder what the
aged<00:07:03.219> one<00:07:03.550> especially<00:07:03.939> the<00:07:04.149> normal<00:07:04.449> if<00:07:04.539> it's

aged one especially the normal if it's

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:06.779 
aged one especially the normal if it's
going<00:07:04.809> to<00:07:04.869> have<00:07:04.990> an<00:07:05.079> iconic<00:07:05.469> pose<00:07:05.789> probably

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
going to have an iconic pose probably

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:07.949 
going to have an iconic pose probably
not<00:07:06.909> something<00:07:07.149> that<00:07:07.240> I<00:07:07.360> would<00:07:07.629> be<00:07:07.749> able<00:07:07.839> to

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:07.959 
not something that I would be able to

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:09.269 
not something that I would be able to
create<00:07:08.169> but<00:07:08.409> hopefully<00:07:08.740> something<00:07:09.039> I<00:07:09.099> could

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:09.279 
create but hopefully something I could

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.620 
create but hopefully something I could
copy<00:07:09.490> from<00:07:10.269> somebody<00:07:10.719> who<00:07:10.839> does<00:07:11.019> a<00:07:11.050> better<00:07:11.169> job

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
copy from somebody who does a better job

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.570 
copy from somebody who does a better job
opposing<00:07:12.110> these<00:07:12.230> things<00:07:12.530> in<00:07:12.800> manuals<00:07:13.310> or

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
opposing these things in manuals or

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.800 
opposing these things in manuals or
around<00:07:14.360> the<00:07:14.510> box<00:07:19.300> do<00:07:20.300> you<00:07:20.360> remember<00:07:20.600> that

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
around the box do you remember that

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.640 
around the box do you remember that
pretzel<00:07:21.050> I<00:07:21.290> was<00:07:21.440> mentioning<00:07:21.620> earlier<00:07:23.650> yes

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
pretzel I was mentioning earlier yes

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:32.050 
pretzel I was mentioning earlier yes
it's<00:07:25.430> very<00:07:25.610> very<00:07:26.470> feasible<00:07:30.760> so<00:07:31.760> there<00:07:31.940> you

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060 
it's very very feasible so there you

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.940 
it's very very feasible so there you
have<00:07:32.090> it<00:07:32.390> the<00:07:32.510> Mobile<00:07:32.810> Suit<00:07:33.140> you've<00:07:33.620> seen

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:33.950 
have it the Mobile Suit you've seen

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.410 
have it the Mobile Suit you've seen
pretty<00:07:34.100> much<00:07:34.220> everything<00:07:34.340> you'd<00:07:34.940> be<00:07:35.060> to<00:07:35.240> see

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:35.420 
pretty much everything you'd be to see

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.090 
pretty much everything you'd be to see
hopefully<00:07:35.660> for<00:07:36.140> you<00:07:36.290> to<00:07:36.410> make<00:07:36.530> a<00:07:36.560> decision<00:07:36.860> as

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.100 
hopefully for you to make a decision as

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.410 
hopefully for you to make a decision as
to<00:07:37.190> whether<00:07:37.400> this<00:07:37.610> is<00:07:37.670> something<00:07:38.120> that<00:07:38.150> you

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:38.420 
to whether this is something that you

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.240 
to whether this is something that you
would<00:07:38.600> want<00:07:38.810> to<00:07:38.870> consider<00:07:39.170> putting<00:07:39.980> together

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
would want to consider putting together

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.520 
would want to consider putting together
and<00:07:40.670> displaying<00:07:41.120> on<00:07:41.300> your<00:07:41.480> shelf<00:07:41.750> and<00:07:41.930> I<00:07:42.140> guess

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.530 
and displaying on your shelf and I guess

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.350 
and displaying on your shelf and I guess
it's<00:07:42.710> just<00:07:42.770> a<00:07:42.950> question<00:07:43.280> of<00:07:43.400> which<00:07:44.000> one<00:07:44.060> of<00:07:44.240> the

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 
it's just a question of which one of the

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.990 
it's just a question of which one of the
many<00:07:44.570> poses<00:07:44.990> will<00:07:45.500> you<00:07:45.680> use<00:07:45.950> and<00:07:46.340> where

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 
many poses will you use and where

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.550 
many poses will you use and where
everybody<00:07:47.360> stay<00:07:47.690> tuned<00:07:47.900> for<00:07:48.110> my<00:07:48.170> next<00:07:48.200> part

everybody stay tuned for my next part
where<00:07:48.710> I<00:07:48.740> run<00:07:48.950> through<00:07:49.130> all<00:07:49.220> the<00:07:49.340> good<00:07:49.460> and<00:07:49.610> bad

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:49.700
