00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.819
 it would seem such a small detail 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.490
 door handles 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.440
 but without them we can not be dispensed unless 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 that completely abandon the door to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 there was nothing to open but very few people 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 will be decided 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 and such apartments where there are no doors even in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.960
 just do not find a bathroom so the door 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.460
 pens are needed in any home today we 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.369
 tell you how to choose 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.019
 door handles choice of door handles 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 characterized by several major 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.500
 indicators design color material 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 availability of mechanism and cost 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 you need to choose pens accordingly 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.559
 the doors first need 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.149
 decide which door to buy 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.940
 interior pens 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.920
 or input should pay attention to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.110
 the color of the material from which she 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.760
 manufactured and also take into account those loads 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.379
 which handle undergo in the future 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 for example for heavy massive doors 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.680
 the choice of the light pen is not the best 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.530
 decision 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.229
 she quickly breaks fail 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.540
 after assignment is determined 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.729
 door handles and how important is the budget 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.180
 can go directly to their 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.340
 choice 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.610
 there are three types of door handles 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.299
 handles knobs so-called 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 pens balls and stationary pushing pen 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.119
 is a lever which when 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.950
 door opening can be lowered down 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.890
 they are on the bar and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.780
 on the outlet in such pens and press and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.479
 so called 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.110
 tongue latch everything is very simple pen 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 knife then 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.229
 latch removed door open handle in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.590
 the initial position of the latch advanced 200 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.420
 fixed this system is very convenient 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.280
 if you need to close the door tightly 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.780
 the door will not open itself until you 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.780
 press the lever handle 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.100
 push handle mechanism can also be 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 equipped with a lock or key lock 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.380
 allows you to lock the door from the inside handles with 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.340
 fixings are often used in bathrooms and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.860
 bathrooms 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.880
 if it is necessary to lock the door 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.450
 at both sides 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.670
 it is worth choosing a mechanism with the key to but 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.920
 Dad principle of operation of the mechanism is similar to 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.570
 push handles only here to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.830
 need to be brought into action 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.530
 turn the ball so sometimes 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.130
 called rotary handles in the kit 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.380
 always come in latch to but also 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.840
 may have a lock or key to 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.840
 lock the door thereby combining 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.700
 not only the handle but also the lock for example when 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.070
 use to but you key door 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.950
 lockable from the inside by the outside 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.020
 the key stationary handles are for 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.270
 in order to open the door when opened 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.360
 on yourself or push and and when closing 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.030
 they do not interact with any lock 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.340
 no snaps there are two kinds 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.250
 stationary handles bracket 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.570
 or spherical depending on the model 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.430
 material and prices 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.770
 they will look good on 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.870
 cottage gate or door utility 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.770
 still need to door tight 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.780
 closed in addition to such 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.630
 stationary pens set
