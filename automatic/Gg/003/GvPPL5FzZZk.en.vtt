00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.249 
in order to separate you know you have
to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.939> very<00:01:35.970> careful<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.020> want<00:01:37.079> to

pull<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.710> too<00:01:38.009> hard<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.540> cause

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
pull it too hard because it can cause

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.590 
pull it too hard because it can cause
frizz<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> curl<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.479> separated<00:01:42.479> i
