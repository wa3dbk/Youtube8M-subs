what<00:00:22.610> is<00:00:22.700> up<00:00:22.820> that<00:00:22.940> is<00:00:23.000> intense<00:00:23.270> ghost<00:00:23.630> here

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:23.870 
what is up that is intense ghost here

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.570 
what is up that is intense ghost here
and<00:00:24.110> today<00:00:24.380> I've<00:00:24.590> got<00:00:24.620> a<00:00:24.770> next<00:00:25.010> part<00:00:25.310> in<00:00:25.460> the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
and today I've got a next part in the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.460 
and today I've got a next part in the
jet<00:00:25.910> tutorial<00:00:26.570> we're<00:00:26.990> going<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.170> be<00:00:27.230> talking

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
jet tutorial we're going to be talking

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.740 
jet tutorial we're going to be talking
about<00:00:27.770> some<00:00:28.070> basic<00:00:28.100> dogfighting<00:00:29.030> techniques

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
about some basic dogfighting techniques

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.440 
about some basic dogfighting techniques
so<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.800> first<00:00:30.980> episode<00:00:31.520> of<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.880> tutorial

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
so in the first episode of the tutorial

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.210 
so in the first episode of the tutorial
I<00:00:32.540> went<00:00:32.840> over<00:00:33.170> speed<00:00:33.470> control<00:00:33.890> on<00:00:34.100> the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
I went over speed control on the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.580 
I went over speed control on the
importance<00:00:34.790> of<00:00:34.970> learning<00:00:35.480> horizontal<00:00:36.350> loops

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
importance of learning horizontal loops

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.710 
importance of learning horizontal loops
as<00:00:36.770> well<00:00:36.800> as<00:00:37.100> vertical<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.760> even<00:00:38.180> diagonal

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
as well as vertical and even diagonal

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.150 
as well as vertical and even diagonal
loops<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:39.410> will<00:00:39.650> link<00:00:39.800> that<00:00:39.920> video

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
loops so I will link that video

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.640 
loops so I will link that video
on-screen<00:00:40.879> now<00:00:41.059> in<00:00:41.270> an<00:00:41.360> annotation<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.170> if

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
on-screen now in an annotation and if

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.470 
on-screen now in an annotation and if
you<00:00:42.739> haven't<00:00:43.040> seen<00:00:43.220> that<00:00:43.250> video<00:00:43.489> already<00:00:44.030> you

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
you haven't seen that video already you

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.000 
you haven't seen that video already you
really<00:00:44.750> must<00:00:44.960> go<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.350> check<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.710> out<00:00:45.830> and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
really must go and check it out and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.650 
really must go and check it out and
master<00:00:46.430> your<00:00:46.550> speed<00:00:46.879> control<00:00:47.390> because

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
master your speed control because

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.390 
master your speed control because
without<00:00:47.840> that<00:00:48.230> you're<00:00:48.770> really<00:00:48.980> not<00:00:49.160> going<00:00:49.340> to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
without that you're really not going to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.000 
without that you're really not going to
stand<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:49.940> chance<00:00:49.970> in<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.540> dogfight<00:00:50.840> now<00:00:51.800> usually

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
stand a chance in a dogfight now usually

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.160 
stand a chance in a dogfight now usually
when<00:00:52.400> I<00:00:52.460> encounter<00:00:52.970> an<00:00:53.090> enemy<00:00:53.239> pilot<00:00:53.660> you

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
when I encounter an enemy pilot you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.050 
when I encounter an enemy pilot you
really<00:00:54.560> do<00:00:54.710> not<00:00:54.890> want<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.250> underestimate<00:00:55.970> the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
really do not want to underestimate the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.880 
really do not want to underestimate the
person<00:00:56.390> ninety<00:00:57.020> percent<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.440> time<00:00:57.649> it

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
person ninety percent of the time it

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.350 
person ninety percent of the time it
turns<00:00:58.130> out<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.460> be<00:00:58.489> somebody<00:00:58.880> who's<00:00:59.060> pretty

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
turns out to be somebody who's pretty

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.180 
turns out to be somebody who's pretty
amateur<00:00:59.809> and<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.320> can<00:01:00.470> simply<00:01:00.770> do<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:00.890> horizontal

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
amateur and I can simply do a horizontal

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.580 
amateur and I can simply do a horizontal
loop<00:01:01.640> catch<00:01:02.180> up<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.510> him<00:01:02.630> via<00:01:02.870> my<00:01:03.079> superior

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
loop catch up to him via my superior

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.049 
loop catch up to him via my superior
speed<00:01:03.860> control<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.460> take<00:01:04.640> him<00:01:04.790> out<00:01:04.850> no

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
speed control and take him out no

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.910 
speed control and take him out no
problem<00:01:05.449> at<00:01:05.600> all<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.410> never<00:01:06.590> want<00:01:06.830> to

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
problem at all but you never want to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.469 
problem at all but you never want to
underestimate<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.729> person<00:01:08.030> who<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.360> the

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
underestimate the person who is in the

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.020 
underestimate the person who is in the
enemy<00:01:08.840> jet<00:01:09.080> especially<00:01:09.830> if<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:10.460> somebody<00:01:10.700> in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
enemy jet especially if it's somebody in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.820 
enemy jet especially if it's somebody in
a<00:01:11.119> stealth<00:01:11.420> jet<00:01:11.690> because<00:01:11.960> they<00:01:12.080> could<00:01:12.350> be<00:01:12.380> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
a stealth jet because they could be a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.190 
a stealth jet because they could be a
pro<00:01:13.160> now<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.940> best<00:01:14.180> policy<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.930> start

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
pro now the best policy is to start

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.380 
pro now the best policy is to start
vertical<00:01:15.800> looping<00:01:16.190> or<00:01:16.399> even<00:01:16.700> better<00:01:16.850> doing

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
vertical looping or even better doing

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.330 
vertical looping or even better doing
diagonal<00:01:18.080> loops<00:01:18.290> these<00:01:18.590> can<00:01:18.830> be<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> little<00:01:19.040> bit

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
diagonal loops these can be a little bit

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.249 
diagonal loops these can be a little bit
tricky<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.729> get<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.060> hang<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:20.899> if<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.110> get

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
tricky to get the hang of but if you get

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.170 
tricky to get the hang of but if you get
your<00:01:21.380> speed<00:01:21.619> control<00:01:22.039> down<00:01:22.190> go<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.940> test

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
your speed control down go in the test

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.029 
your speed control down go in the test
range<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.660> just<00:01:24.140> practice<00:01:24.380> doing<00:01:24.619> them

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
range and just practice doing them

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.830 
range and just practice doing them
they'll<00:01:25.310> become<00:01:25.460> second<00:01:26.000> nature<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.420> no<00:01:26.600> time

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
they'll become second nature in no time

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.960 
they'll become second nature in no time
at<00:01:26.990> all<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.950> first<00:01:28.250> off<00:01:28.400> we're<00:01:28.580> going<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.760> talk

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
at all so first off we're going to talk

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.280 
at all so first off we're going to talk
about<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> most<00:01:29.510> difficult<00:01:29.930> thing<00:01:30.110> in

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
about the most difficult thing in

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.469 
about the most difficult thing in
dogfighting<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.850> actually<00:01:32.000> shaking

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
dogfighting and that is actually shaking

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.340 
dogfighting and that is actually shaking
a<00:01:32.780> tail

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
a tail

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.350 
a tail
now<00:01:33.710> for<00:01:33.920> example<00:01:34.010> sake<00:01:34.580> let's<00:01:34.940> say<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.210> enemy

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
now for example sake let's say the enemy

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.719 
now for example sake let's say the enemy
jet<00:01:35.690> who<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.080> your<00:01:36.229> tail<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.710> pretty<00:01:37.340> decent

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
jet who is on your tail is pretty decent

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.460 
jet who is on your tail is pretty decent
pilot<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.240> he's<00:01:38.420> got<00:01:38.570> his<00:01:38.600> speed<00:01:38.930> control<00:01:39.260> down

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
pilot so he's got his speed control down

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.410 
pilot so he's got his speed control down
and<00:01:39.740> he<00:01:40.010> can<00:01:40.189> mimic<00:01:40.520> your<00:01:40.670> loops<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.210> any

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
and he can mimic your loops in any

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.240 
and he can mimic your loops in any
direction<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.439> how<00:01:42.590> do<00:01:42.650> you<00:01:42.799> get<00:01:42.890> him<00:01:42.979> off<00:01:43.100> your

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
direction so how do you get him off your

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.859 
direction so how do you get him off your
tail<00:01:43.490> well<00:01:44.119> there's<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.420> technique<00:01:44.840> called

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
tail well there's a technique called

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.289 
tail well there's a technique called
switching<00:01:45.710> now<00:01:46.220> what<00:01:46.400> switching<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.060> is

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
switching now what switching is is

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.660 
switching now what switching is is
essentially<00:01:48.080> changing<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.920> direction<00:01:49.100> in

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
essentially changing the direction in

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.730 
essentially changing the direction in
which<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.360> loop<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.080> whenever<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.590> switch

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
which you loop so whenever you switch

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.340 
which you loop so whenever you switch
from<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.580> horizontal<00:01:53.119> loop<00:01:53.570> into<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.049> vertical

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
diagonal loop that is called a switch

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.940 
diagonal loop that is called a switch
now<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.930> times<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.770> want<00:02:00.920> to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
now the times that you really want to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.800 
now the times that you really want to
perform<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.400> switch<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.820> when<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.450> are<00:02:02.600> either

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
perform a switch is when you are either

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.109 
perform a switch is when you are either
at<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> peak<00:02:03.380> or<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.040> very<00:02:04.250> bottom<00:02:04.790> of<00:02:04.909> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
at the peak or the very bottom of the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.090 
at the peak or the very bottom of the
loop<00:02:05.329> as<00:02:05.570> these<00:02:05.810> are<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.079> times<00:02:06.350> when<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.009> are

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
loop as these are the times when you are

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.219 
loop as these are the times when you are
the<00:02:07.189> most<00:02:07.369> out-of-sight<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:08.329> the<00:02:08.450> enemy<00:02:08.780> pilot

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
the most out-of-sight of the enemy pilot

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.930 
the most out-of-sight of the enemy pilot
so<00:02:09.590> as<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.799> can<00:02:09.920> see<00:02:10.070> from<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.310> footage<00:02:10.459> here

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
so as you can see from the footage here

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.150 
so as you can see from the footage here
I'm<00:02:11.120> looping<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> top<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.739> then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
I'm looping right to the top and then

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.100 
I'm looping right to the top and then
I'm<00:02:13.250> ever<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.640> slightly<00:02:14.000> changing<00:02:14.959> my

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
I'm ever so slightly changing my

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.990 
I'm ever so slightly changing my
direction<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.829> which<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.160> doing<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.489> loop<00:02:16.700> so

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
direction in which I'm doing the loop so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.729 
direction in which I'm doing the loop so
they<00:02:17.120> were<00:02:17.180> enemy<00:02:17.450> pilot<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:17.989> going<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.590> think

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
they were enemy pilot is going to think

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.229 
they were enemy pilot is going to think
that<00:02:18.829> I've<00:02:19.010> carried<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.519> looping<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
that I've carried on looping in the

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.090 
that I've carried on looping in the
exact<00:02:20.540> same<00:02:20.780> direction<00:02:20.989> when<00:02:21.380> he<00:02:21.590> reaches<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
exact same direction when he reaches the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.830 
exact same direction when he reaches the
top<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.430> his<00:02:22.579> loop<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.030> he's<00:02:23.510> not<00:02:23.660> going<00:02:23.780> to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
top of his loop and he's not going to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.720 
top of his loop and he's not going to
see<00:02:24.019> me<00:02:24.170> anymore<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.709> lo<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.100> behold<00:02:25.220> I've

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
see me anymore and lo and behold I've

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.970 
see me anymore and lo and behold I've
actually<00:02:26.060> changed<00:02:26.600> my<00:02:26.660> direction<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.829> do

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
actually changed my direction if you do

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.830 
actually changed my direction if you do
this<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.310> lot<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.670> times<00:02:28.940> at<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.390> bottom<00:02:29.720> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
this a lot of times at the bottom and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.080 
this a lot of times at the bottom and
top<00:02:30.079> of<00:02:30.139> your<00:02:30.440> loops<00:02:30.650> eventually<00:02:31.280> he<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.880> end

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
top of your loops eventually he can end

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030 
top of your loops eventually he can end
up<00:02:32.209> losing<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.810> completely<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
up losing you completely and you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.729 
up losing you completely and you
on<00:02:34.159> his<00:02:34.430> tail<00:02:34.700> instead<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:36.230> something<00:02:36.650> you

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
on his tail instead now something you

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.589 
on his tail instead now something you
can<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.219> use<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.640> your<00:02:37.730> advantage<00:02:37.819> in<00:02:38.450> this

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
can really use to your advantage in this

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.349 
can really use to your advantage in this
situation<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.409> your<00:02:40.219> ECM<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.239> is

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
situation is your ECM and this is

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.759 
situation is your ECM and this is
actually<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:41.780> number<00:02:42.079> one<00:02:42.200> reason<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
actually the number one reason that I

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.759 
actually the number one reason that I
fly<00:02:43.040> with<00:02:43.069> ECM<00:02:43.670> instead<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.569> flares<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.439> allows

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
fly with ECM instead of flares it allows

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.940 
fly with ECM instead of flares it allows
you<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.099> disappear<00:02:46.609> off<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.239> air<00:02:47.390> radar

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
you to disappear off of the air radar

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.679 
you to disappear off of the air radar
90%<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.159> time<00:02:49.340> your<00:02:49.519> dogfighting<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.510> guy

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
90% of the time your dogfighting the guy

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.270 
90% of the time your dogfighting the guy
who<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.049> your<00:02:51.079> tail<00:02:51.439> is<00:02:51.680> not<00:02:51.709> actually

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
who is on your tail is not actually

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.710 
who is on your tail is not actually

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
going to be able to see your jet

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.690 
going to be able to see your jet
physically<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.470> game<00:02:54.709> he's<00:02:55.220> simply<00:02:55.489> going

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
physically in the game he's simply going

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.550 
physically in the game he's simply going
to<00:02:55.760> be<00:02:55.819> using<00:02:56.150> his<00:02:56.269> air<00:02:56.480> radar<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.319> follow

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
to be using his air radar to follow

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.559 
to be using his air radar to follow
where<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:58.040> are<00:02:58.310> now<00:02:58.909> let's<00:02:59.120> say<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.480> this

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
where you are now let's say in this

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.599 
where you are now let's say in this
example<00:02:59.629> he<00:03:00.500> can't<00:03:00.739> see<00:03:00.889> your<00:03:01.069> vapor<00:03:01.250> trails

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
example he can't see your vapor trails

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.190 
example he can't see your vapor trails
from<00:03:01.730> your<00:03:01.970> jet<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.329> he's<00:03:02.510> really<00:03:02.720> relying

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
from your jet so he's really relying

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.470 
from your jet so he's really relying
solely<00:03:03.500> upon<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:04.010> air<00:03:04.159> radar<00:03:04.609> if<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.269> wait

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
solely upon the air radar if you wait

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.210 
solely upon the air radar if you wait
until<00:03:05.659> you<00:03:05.900> get<00:03:06.109> to<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.379> top<00:03:06.590> or<00:03:06.769> bottom<00:03:06.829> of

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
until you get to the top or bottom of

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.460 
until you get to the top or bottom of
your<00:03:07.400> loop<00:03:07.609> just<00:03:08.239> about<00:03:08.569> as<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.959> turn<00:03:09.200> to

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
your loop just about as you turn to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.619 
your loop just about as you turn to
switch<00:03:09.709> pop<00:03:10.489> your<00:03:10.700> ECM<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.480> will

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
switch pop your ECM and you will

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.899 
switch pop your ECM and you will
disappear<00:03:12.019> for<00:03:12.379> a<00:03:12.409> few<00:03:12.650> seconds<00:03:13.099> off<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.280> the

and<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.010> dogfight<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.180> difference

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
and a dogfight it can be the difference

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.240

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139

it<00:03:33.379> can<00:03:33.950> also<00:03:34.069> become<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.609> even<00:03:35.030> if<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.209> enemy

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
the air radar quite as much you can

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170 
the air radar quite as much you can
actually<00:03:48.919> just<00:03:49.220> follow<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.639> vapor<00:03:49.849> trails

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
actually just follow the vapor trails

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.030 
actually just follow the vapor trails
and<00:03:50.479> these<00:03:50.690> will<00:03:50.870> give<00:03:51.079> some<00:03:51.260> telltale<00:03:51.680> signs

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
and these will give some telltale signs

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.550 
and these will give some telltale signs
as<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.849> exactly<00:03:53.299> which<00:03:53.479> direction<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.229> turned

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
as to exactly which direction you turned

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.740 
as to exactly which direction you turned
in<00:03:54.769> however<00:03:55.340> once<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.639> pop<00:03:55.790> ECM<00:03:56.299> as<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:56.540> know

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
in however once you pop ECM as you know

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.559 
in however once you pop ECM as you know
a<00:03:56.930> big<00:03:57.470> black<00:03:57.739> smoke<00:03:57.949> cloud<00:03:58.370> comes<00:03:58.970> out<00:03:59.299> of<00:03:59.479> the

a big black smoke cloud comes out of the

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.750 
a big black smoke cloud comes out of the
back<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.199> reason<00:04:00.560> for<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:00.979> to<00:04:01.489> blind

your<00:04:07.250> ECM<00:04:07.729> this<00:04:08.299> will<00:04:08.540> give<00:04:08.720> away<00:04:08.810> your

deduce in which direction the enemy jet
went<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:24.080> get<00:04:24.229> on<00:04:24.349> his<00:04:24.590> tail<00:04:24.830> you

went so you can get on his tail you

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.250 
went so you can get on his tail you
really<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:26.150> need<00:04:26.449> to<00:04:26.510> get<00:04:26.810> good<00:04:27.050> at

jet pilot across them up if you're

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
pretty sure that you spotted him you

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.010 
pretty sure that you spotted him you
really<00:05:37.340> want<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.550> fly<00:05:37.729> straight<00:05:38.300> towards<00:05:38.900> him

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
really want to fly straight towards him

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.839 
really want to fly straight towards him
don't<00:05:39.320> go<00:05:39.470> round<00:05:39.710> in<00:05:40.009> a<00:05:40.099> horizontal<00:05:40.370> loop

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
don't go round in a horizontal loop

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.879 
don't go round in a horizontal loop
because<00:05:41.449> that's<00:05:41.660> going<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:41.930> give<00:05:42.169> him<00:05:42.410> the

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
because that's going to give him the

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.370 
because that's going to give him the
exposure<00:05:43.639> on<00:05:44.000> your<00:05:44.419> jet<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.810> he<00:05:45.020> needs<00:05:45.259> to

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
exposure on your jet that he needs to

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.990 
exposure on your jet that he needs to
actually<00:05:45.680> take<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:46.039> out<00:05:46.190> you<00:05:46.669> know<00:05:46.759> just

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
actually take you out you know just

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.700 
actually take you out you know just
imagine<00:05:47.090> if<00:05:47.509> you<00:05:47.539> turn<00:05:47.960> to<00:05:48.139> the<00:05:48.229> left<00:05:48.410> in<00:05:48.620> a

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
imagine if you turn to the left in a

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
horizontal loop he's gonna be able to

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.779 
horizontal loop he's gonna be able to
see<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.840> whole<00:05:51.020> top<00:05:51.470> of<00:05:51.650> your<00:05:52.220> jet<00:05:52.520> and<00:05:52.639> that's

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
see the whole top of your jet and that's

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.640 
see the whole top of your jet and that's
going<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.060> be<00:05:53.120> easy<00:05:53.419> for<00:05:53.690> him<00:05:53.840> at<00:05:54.050> range<00:05:54.380> to

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
going to be easy for him at range to

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.290 
going to be easy for him at range to
take<00:05:54.830> you<00:05:54.979> out<00:05:55.099> what<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:55.550> want<00:05:55.699> to<00:05:55.760> do<00:05:55.880> is<00:05:56.060> fly

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
take you out what you want to do is fly

take you out what you want to do is fly
straight<00:05:56.690> towards<00:05:57.169> him<00:05:57.229> so<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:57.979> amount

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
straight towards him so that the amount

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.610 
straight towards him so that the amount

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
because a lot of amateur pilots will

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.520

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
as soon as you pass him you hear that

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.950
