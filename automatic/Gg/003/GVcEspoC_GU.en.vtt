00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.080
 Andrew to trim the deal is 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 multiparty was for paris 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:40.550

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:40.550
 another right there 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:58.440

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:01.440
 in a disc was already here is this tremendous 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.710
 11 not extreme spine that is wrong saw 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.380
 that I was using this here is this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 mirror here is while you are not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 they arrived 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 I enjoyed that no one looked I was 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.950
 here suddenly I like to know that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 mirror and so leaves me the delphi more 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.580
 handsome is what is is true is that in 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.939
 It's true, I think you are. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.740
 little like me and for example is 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.600
 Incidentally, an eyebrow looks like my 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 because she's full of pity then 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.110
 I really have eustachian hair 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 look alike 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.869
 his is not green is not but but it is so 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.869
 Stylish is also cool. I liked it very well. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 third, in fact I think the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.640
 I see helmes yango in you a little 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 because I think you look like one 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.939
 I thought you and me too. 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.709
 They look and resemble me. 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:12.220
 you fill my foot and I also think 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.870
 we are very similar, same is almost 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.030
 almost like it is not 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.890
 but even if you are already here of course 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:32.470
 is because the backyard of the culture began 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:39.549
 It's not your ludovico barber will open 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.709
 the barber shop louai mec then do not delay 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.080
 to read the Barbary so unfortunately 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.340

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.420

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.660
 I do not know but we did not come here to 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 cut the hair not so that we 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.570
 we see this scene in the backyard of the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.730
 same way it's not starting 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.870
 staff also already the line can enter 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.319
 for you 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.970
 The night was really cool this machine but 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.870
 It's the place I feel is that they stay. 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.730
 make yourself comfortable 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.739
 the staff thinks they are here you 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.310
 are there the yard can start 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.780
 And how exciting is that excuse and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.579
 Then go by and see nobody was there. 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.579
