00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.259 
scope and welcome back to ATL studio
today<00:00:13.459> I'm<00:00:14.459> showing<00:00:14.879> you<00:00:15.029> how<00:00:15.869> to<00:00:16.970> how<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.029> use

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
today I'm showing you how to how you use

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.439 
today I'm showing you how to how you use
focus<00:00:18.960> stacking<00:00:19.369> in<00:00:20.369> our<00:00:20.880> macro<00:00:21.300> photography

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
focus stacking in our macro photography

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.950 
focus stacking in our macro photography
you<00:00:22.200> do<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> several<00:00:22.830> shots<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.480> one<00:00:24.480> subject

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you do the several shots of one subject

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.770 
you do the several shots of one subject
and<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.220> combine<00:00:26.400> them<00:00:26.699> together<00:00:26.880> but

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
and then you combine them together but

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.269 
and then you combine them together but
the<00:00:27.960> difference<00:00:28.320> between<00:00:28.440> each<00:00:28.740> shot<00:00:28.770> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the difference between each shot is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.360 
the difference between each shot is
where<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.930> have<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> focus<00:00:31.759> point<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.510> OT

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
where we have a focus point on the OT

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.700 
where we have a focus point on the OT
there<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:35.609> ways<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:37.500> move<00:00:37.649> focus<00:00:38.069> to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
there are two ways to to move focus to

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.660 
there are two ways to to move focus to
the<00:00:40.710> object<00:00:41.359> one<00:00:42.530> which<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.679> not<00:00:43.800> right<00:00:44.100> they

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the object one which is not right they

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.110 
the object one which is not right they
are<00:00:45.089> to<00:00:47.359> change<00:00:48.359> your<00:00:48.600> focusing<00:00:49.319> point<00:00:49.679> by

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
are to change your focusing point by

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.559 
are to change your focusing point by
adjusting<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.299> lens<00:00:51.510> focus<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
adjusting the lens focus and but the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.689 
adjusting the lens focus and but the
correct<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:55.139> to<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.429> to<00:00:56.729> move<00:00:57.350> camera

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
correct way to do it is to move camera

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
correct way to do it is to move camera
up<00:00:59.699> towards<00:01:00.299> the<00:01:00.389> subject<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:00.989> backward

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
up towards the subject or backward

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.189 
up towards the subject or backward
depends<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> where<00:01:02.699> focuses<00:01:03.389> to<00:01:04.049> move

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
depends on where focuses to move

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
depends on where focuses to move
focusing<00:01:04.710> point<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.150> need<00:01:06.240> for

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
focusing point what do we need for

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
focusing point what do we need for
proper<00:01:06.840> striking<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> macro<00:01:11.390> focusing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
proper striking this is a macro focusing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.310 
proper striking this is a macro focusing
rails<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> move<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.620> camera<00:01:15.320> by

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
rails you can move the camera by

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.570 
rails you can move the camera by

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
rotating this micrometric dialogue home

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.420 
rotating this micrometric dialogue home
called<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.940> can<00:01:24.120> have<00:01:24.300> very<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.870> very

gray<00:02:28.239> one<00:02:28.480> why<00:02:29.109> I<00:02:29.139> use<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.620> gray<00:02:29.950> gray<00:02:30.849> is<00:02:30.909> kind

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
gray one why I use a gray gray is kind

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.479 
gray one why I use a gray gray is kind
of<00:02:31.719> it<00:02:31.959> can<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.469> white<00:02:32.709> or<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.099> can<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.430> black

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
of it can be white or you can do black

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.059 
of it can be white or you can do black
depends<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.209> how<00:02:34.389> high<00:02:34.780> light<00:02:35.019> no<00:02:35.769> light<00:02:36.010> you

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
depends on how high light no light you

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.610 
depends on how high light no light you
like<00:02:36.700> more<00:02:37.090> light<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.599> will<00:02:37.930> be<00:02:38.079> almost<00:02:38.230> white

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
like more light it will be almost white

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.530 
like more light it will be almost white
but<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.609> gray<00:02:39.819> it's<00:02:40.120> easier<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.750> get<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
but the gray it's easier to get the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.739 
but the gray it's easier to get the
light<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> fall<00:02:44.049> off<00:02:44.319> from<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.700> spot<00:02:46.030> so

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:46.749 
light and fall off from the that spot so

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.679 
light and fall off from the that spot so
it's<00:02:46.959> faster<00:02:47.409> gets<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.950> darker<00:02:48.489> areas<00:02:48.879> why

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
it's faster gets to darker areas why

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.610 
it's faster gets to darker areas why
need<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.790> our<00:02:51.790> bracelet<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.840> silver<00:02:53.379> and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
need so our bracelet is a silver and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.509 
need so our bracelet is a silver and
it's<00:02:54.189> not<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.639> a<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:55.480> white<00:02:55.810> silver<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:57.459> has

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
it's not just a like white silver it has

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.959 
it's not just a like white silver it has
its<00:02:57.939> flowers<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.739> flowers<00:02:59.889> is<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:01.019> kind<00:03:02.019> of

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
its flowers and the flowers is a kind of
