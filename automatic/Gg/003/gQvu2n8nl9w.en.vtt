I've<00:00:22.880> seen<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.150> couple<00:00:23.450> other<00:00:23.570> videos<00:00:23.750> on

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
I've seen a couple other videos on

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.790 
I've seen a couple other videos on
YouTube<00:00:24.230> regarding<00:00:24.829> this<00:00:25.250> issue<00:00:25.489> but<00:00:26.419> I<00:00:26.800> think

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
YouTube regarding this issue but I think

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.310 
YouTube regarding this issue but I think
I've<00:00:28.160> definitely<00:00:28.369> got<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.270> best<00:00:29.689> fix<00:00:30.020> for<00:00:30.230> it

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
I've definitely got the best fix for it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.510 
I've definitely got the best fix for it
so<00:00:32.230> I'll<00:00:33.230> walk<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.620> through<00:00:33.829> exactly<00:00:33.980> what

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
the issues on I'm number one let me just

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.330 
the issues on I'm number one let me just
get<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.239> camera<00:00:38.539> in<00:00:38.570> properly<00:00:39.019> you<00:00:39.949> can<00:00:40.129> see

get the camera in properly you can see
I've<00:00:40.609> changed<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.989> double<00:00:42.410> carburetor

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
I've changed the double carburetor

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.520 
I've changed the double carburetor
system<00:00:43.370> into<00:00:44.149> a<00:00:44.179> single<00:00:44.570> cob<00:00:44.780> I'll<00:00:45.019> show<00:00:45.469> you

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
system into a single cob I'll show you

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.930 
system into a single cob I'll show you
from<00:00:45.679> the<00:00:45.829> other<00:00:45.949> side<00:00:46.039> it's<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:46.579> little<00:00:46.760> bit

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
from the other side it's a little bit

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.200 
from the other side it's a little bit
easier<00:00:47.269> to<00:00:47.300> see<00:00:47.469> but<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.370> previous<00:00:49.760> video

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
easier to see but the previous video

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.619 
easier to see but the previous video
showed<00:00:50.629> that<00:00:51.019> and<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:52.280> engine<00:00:52.730> does<00:00:52.999> vibrate

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
showed that and this engine does vibrate

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.389 
showed that and this engine does vibrate
and<00:00:53.839> rattle<00:00:54.170> around<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.559> heck<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.769> a<00:00:54.920> lot<00:00:55.070> and

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
and rattle around a heck of a lot and

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.959 
and rattle around a heck of a lot and
and<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:56.629> can<00:00:56.839> confirm<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:58.429> last<00:00:58.640> time<00:00:58.850> I

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
and I can confirm that the last time I

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.959 
and I can confirm that the last time I
took<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.449> boat<00:00:59.600> out<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:01.190> air<00:01:01.519> filter<00:01:01.940> cover

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
took the boat out the air filter cover

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.450 
took the boat out the air filter cover
an<00:01:02.480> air<00:01:03.079> filter<00:01:03.260> we're<00:01:03.589> just<00:01:03.769> laying<00:01:03.949> loose

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
an air filter we're just laying loose

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.320 
an air filter we're just laying loose
inside<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.970> boat<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.100> bolts<00:01:08.000> or

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
inside the boat and the the bolts or

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.710 
inside the boat and the the bolts or
nuts<00:01:08.600> wrong<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:10.100> held<00:01:10.369> our<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:10.909> had

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
nuts wrong that held our on and had

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.289 
nuts wrong that held our on and had
vibrated<00:01:12.320> loose<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.710> come<00:01:12.860> off<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.299> so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
vibrated loose and come off and so

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.090 
vibrated loose and come off and so
obviously<00:01:14.689> being<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:15.020> two-stroke<00:01:15.470> it's<00:01:16.009> a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
obviously being a two-stroke it's a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.980 
obviously being a two-stroke it's a
vibrant<00:01:16.520> part<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.450> need<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.720> correct

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
vibrant part of it you need the correct

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.429 
vibrant part of it you need the correct
airflow<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.710> get<00:01:18.860> through<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.250> boat<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
airflow to get through to the boat and

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.230 
airflow to get through to the boat and
to<00:01:21.439> give<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:21.649> optimum<00:01:22.070> performance<00:01:22.219> I<00:01:22.759> go

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
to give you optimum performance I go

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.319 
to give you optimum performance I go
around<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.479> other<00:01:23.630> side<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:25.240> okay<00:01:26.240> I'm

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
around the other side now okay I'm

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.819 
around the other side now okay I'm
around<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.630> other<00:01:26.719> side<00:01:26.840> let<00:01:27.409> me<00:01:27.439> just<00:01:27.680> move

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
around the other side let me just move

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.190 
around the other side let me just move
that<00:01:28.040> out<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.399> way<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.729> see<00:01:29.000> as<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.110> can

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
that out of the way and see as you can

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.289 
that out of the way and see as you can
see<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:30.649> single<00:01:31.189> carburetor<00:01:31.549> system<00:01:32.149> and

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
see the single carburetor system and

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.560 
see the single carburetor system and
they're<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> little<00:01:32.630> bit<00:01:32.780> thinner<00:01:33.130> but<00:01:34.570> yeah

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
they're a little bit thinner but yeah

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.319 
they're a little bit thinner but yeah
again<00:01:35.960> as<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.250> started<00:01:37.579> working<00:01:37.759> on<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.149> boat

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
again as I started working on the boat

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.029 
again as I started working on the boat
to<00:01:38.689> figure<00:01:39.079> out<00:01:39.229> what<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.530> problem<00:01:39.829> was

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
to figure out what the problem was

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.209 
to figure out what the problem was
why<00:01:40.549> wasn't<00:01:40.789> picking<00:01:41.090> up<00:01:41.299> 100%<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.159> pulled<00:01:43.159> the

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
why wasn't picking up 100% I pulled the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.310 
why wasn't picking up 100% I pulled the
edge<00:01:43.340> CDs<00:01:43.729> off<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.090> one<00:01:44.240> was<00:01:44.390> fine<00:01:44.659> when<00:01:45.259> I

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
edge CDs off that one was fine when I

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.690 
edge CDs off that one was fine when I
pulled<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:45.680> one<00:01:45.860> off<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.280> noticed<00:01:46.759> that<00:01:48.700> let

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
pulled this one off I noticed that let

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.300 
pulled this one off I noticed that let
me<00:01:49.789> just<00:01:50.030> get<00:01:50.149> this<00:01:50.210> plug<00:01:50.539> out<00:01:50.689> there<00:01:51.380> where's

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
me just get this plug out there where's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.740 
me just get this plug out there where's
the<00:01:52.579> camera

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
the camera

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.370 
the camera
I<00:01:53.780> noticed<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.859> plug<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.609> the<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.140> top

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
I noticed that this plug on the the top

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.980 
I noticed that this plug on the the top
of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.619> actual<00:01:58.009> spark<00:01:58.369> plug<00:01:58.579> was<00:01:59.180> inside<00:01:59.719> the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
of the actual spark plug was inside the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.910 
of the actual spark plug was inside the
HT<00:02:00.439> lead<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:02.079> and<00:02:03.079> I<00:02:03.229> can<00:02:03.409> only<00:02:03.530> put<00:02:03.740> that

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
HT lead and so and I can only put that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.200 
HT lead and so and I can only put that
down<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.340> vibrations<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.560> also<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.820> the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
down to vibrations and also the the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.650 
down to vibrations and also the the
spark<00:02:08.539> plug<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.820> extremely<00:02:10.820> fouled<00:02:11.210> up<00:02:11.480> you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
spark plug is extremely fouled up you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.830 
spark plug is extremely fouled up you
know<00:02:11.780> there's<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.050> lot<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.760> grit<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.060> oil<00:02:14.630> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
know there's a lot of grit and oil and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.570 
know there's a lot of grit and oil and
everything<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.380> end<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.740> what<00:02:16.460> I'm

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
everything on the end of it so what I'm

going to do with these is I'm going to
get<00:02:17.840> rid<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.020> these<00:02:18.230> plugs

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
get rid of these plugs

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400 
get rid of these plugs
and<00:02:19.250> get<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> couple<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.480> new<00:02:20.660> ones<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:21.050> them<00:02:21.200> and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
and get a couple of new ones in them and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.200 
and get a couple of new ones in them and
what<00:02:21.860> I'm<00:02:21.980> I'm<00:02:22.820> also<00:02:23.060> going<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.330> pour<00:02:24.200> a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
what I'm I'm also going to pour a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.320 
what I'm I'm also going to pour a
special<00:02:26.210> fuel<00:02:26.450> mixture<00:02:26.780> into<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:28.330> cylinder

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
special fuel mixture into the cylinder

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.670 
special fuel mixture into the cylinder
port<00:02:29.570> itself<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:31.930> might<00:02:32.930> even<00:02:33.110> leave<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.470> plug

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
port itself I might even leave the plug

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.360 
port itself I might even leave the plug
off<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.670> put<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.850> rag<00:02:35.120> over<00:02:35.480> there<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
off and just put a rag over there and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.430 
off and just put a rag over there and
fire<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.550> motor<00:02:37.760> over<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.720> just<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> clear

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
fire the motor over just just to clear

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.020 
fire the motor over just just to clear
that<00:02:39.620> particular<00:02:40.130> person<00:02:40.460> up<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.850> bit

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
that particular person up a little bit

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.550 
that particular person up a little bit
because<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.480> seems<00:02:41.870> like<00:02:41.960> it's<00:02:42.230> been<00:02:42.380> running

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
because it seems like it's been running

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.030 
because it seems like it's been running
with<00:02:42.890> them<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:44.060> know<00:02:44.180> limited<00:02:44.710> limited<00:02:45.710> um

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
with them you know limited limited um

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.900 
with them you know limited limited um
spark<00:02:46.640> or<00:02:46.880> even<00:02:47.150> no<00:02:47.300> spark<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.460> I<00:02:49.760> think

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
spark or even no spark so I think

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.490 
spark or even no spark so I think
there's<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.360> couple<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.870> main<00:02:51.050> issues<00:02:51.230> your

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
there's a couple of the main issues your

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.990 
there's a couple of the main issues your
just<00:02:51.680> got<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.860> make<00:02:51.950> sure<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.190> everything<00:02:52.880> is

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
just got to make sure that everything is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.450 
just got to make sure that everything is
nice<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:53.240> solid<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.900> tight<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:55.340> you

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
nice and solid and tight and and you

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.810 
nice and solid and tight and and you
can't<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:55.850> go<00:02:55.970> wrong<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:57.310> overall<00:02:58.310> it's<00:02:58.730> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
can't really go wrong and overall it's a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.310 
can't really go wrong and overall it's a
good<00:02:58.970> boat<00:02:59.710> every<00:03:00.710> every<00:03:01.040> mechanical<00:03:01.610> bloody

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
good boat every every mechanical bloody

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.870 
good boat every every mechanical bloody
object<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.710> have<00:03:03.890> problems<00:03:04.340> from

object is going to have problems from
time<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.420> time<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:05.900> working<00:03:06.590> through<00:03:06.800> a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
time to time it's just working through a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.160 
time to time it's just working through a
process<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.370> elimination<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:08.660> find<00:03:08.900> out<00:03:09.020> what

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
process of elimination to find out what

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.890 
process of elimination to find out what
the<00:03:09.290> problems<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:09.980> know<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:10.430> I'll<00:03:11.330> do<00:03:11.630> all

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
the problems are you know so I'll do all

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.660 
the problems are you know so I'll do all
of<00:03:12.020> this<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.380> I'll<00:03:12.860> see<00:03:13.160> how<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.370> goes

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
of this and I'll see how it goes

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.360 
of this and I'll see how it goes
I<00:03:13.940> might<00:03:14.810> even<00:03:14.960> run<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> driveway<00:03:15.950> just

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
I might even run it on the driveway just

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
I might even run it on the driveway just
to<00:03:16.460> see<00:03:16.640> how<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.940> picks<00:03:17.090> up<00:03:17.270> with<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
to see how it picks up with that on the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.650 
to see how it picks up with that on the
video<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.460> we'll<00:03:19.460> go<00:03:19.610> from<00:03:19.730> there<00:03:20.000> Cheers
