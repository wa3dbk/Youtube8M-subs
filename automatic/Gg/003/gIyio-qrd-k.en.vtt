one what are some of the things that are
really<00:00:41.070> important<00:00:41.579> number<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
really important number one we like to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
really important number one we like to
consider<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> tractor<00:00:43.770> size<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.399> farmers

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
consider it tractor size because farmers

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
consider it tractor size because farmers
have<00:00:45.210> certain<00:00:45.510> tractors<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> they<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
have certain tractors that they have for

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
have certain tractors that they have for
their<00:00:46.800> color<00:00:46.980> Vater<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.340> their<00:00:47.460> plow<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.239> we

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
their color Vater in their plow so we

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.790 
their color Vater in their plow so we
like<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.719> sure<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> sprinter<00:00:49.649> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
like to make sure that the sprinter is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.729 
like to make sure that the sprinter is
chosen<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.570> device<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
chosen for that device and so if you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.250 
chosen for that device and so if you
have<00:00:52.890> 100<00:00:53.070> horsepower<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:54.120> choose<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> 12,000

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
have 100 horsepower we choose a 12,000

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
have 100 horsepower we choose a 12,000
litre<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> 200<00:00:56.940> horse<00:00:57.059> track

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.369 
litre or if you have a 200 horse track
tur<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.809> run<00:00:57.930> something<00:00:58.260> like

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
tur then you could run something like

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
tur then you could run something like
this<00:00:58.500> which<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> 7,000<00:00:59.760> US<00:00:59.940> gallon<00:01:00.449> sprayer

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this which is a 7,000 US gallon sprayer

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
this which is a 7,000 US gallon sprayer
is<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> biggest<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> market

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
is this one of the biggest on the market

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.219 
is this one of the biggest on the market
or<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.730> bigger<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.960> bigger

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
or they get bigger they do get bigger

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.929 
or they get bigger they do get bigger
this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> our<00:01:04.979> biggest<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this is one of our biggest we make now a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.630 
this is one of our biggest we make now a
7000<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.200> 8,000<00:01:07.830> US<00:01:07.950> gallon<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.549> a

7000 and at 8,000 US gallon on a
tri-axial<00:01:09.270> power<00:01:09.510> okay

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
tri-axial power okay

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
tri-axial power okay
how<00:01:11.520> important<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.939> tire<00:01:12.150> flotation<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.930> tire

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
how important is tire flotation or tire

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.750 
how important is tire flotation or tire
size<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> probably<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
size and you know that is probably the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.980 
size and you know that is probably the
most<00:01:14.939> important<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
most important thing and that's to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.469 
most important thing and that's to
reduce<00:01:16.380> compaction<00:01:17.000> because<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.210> need<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
reduce compaction because we need to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
reduce compaction because we need to
grow<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> crop<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> most<00:01:20.009> fertility

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
grow the crop and it the most fertility

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.950 
grow the crop and it the most fertility
to<00:01:20.580> crop<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.299> putting<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.840> far

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to crop so what we're putting on as far

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
to crop so what we're putting on as far
as<00:01:22.020> nitrogen<00:01:22.430> we<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:23.790> sure<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
as nitrogen we want to make sure that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.380 
as nitrogen we want to make sure that
that<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
that can be you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.150 
that can be you
and<00:01:25.480> reduce<00:01:26.020> compaction<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.710> best<00:01:26.890> way<00:01:27.010> in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
and reduce compaction is the best way in

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.680 
and reduce compaction is the best way in
