00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.120
 sensations 45 minutes to return to 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.070
 try to catch something of itself the truth that 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.440
 very well the truth that I had a little 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.450
 of fear for being something artificial not 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.970
 be used to that dies be 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.320
 many years and play just the truth 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.419
 very happy 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.430
 we wanted to stretch in some action has you 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.259
 resentful at some point normally 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.439
 well no no what happens that good these 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.880
 days have been hard work and good is 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.349
 pulling as a precaution just do not 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.670
 with nothing else but we have had good 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.590
 this conversation in teresa herrera 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.510
 just the next day the training 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.859
 that I had the manager if the bad luck of 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.690
 have the injury again but good 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.129
 let's hope and this time it gives me and luck 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.070
 objective and bar and also objective 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.809
 Realistically I do not know how to be good, you have to go a little 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.969
 little truth that we have here a 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.710
 recovery time there is no league and 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.410
 the break was for me sincerely I 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.239
 it's great to get a tone 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.790
 physical and to get to the level of my 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.800
 comrades was one 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.650
 we played as a reference is a 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.809
 perhaps more comfortable possibility 93 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.860
 behind the good forward I 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.510
 I was always driven by four 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.190
 top positions I feel comfortable 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.200
 and I did it out I owe it to what I 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.060
 say the coach is the boss 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.050
 taste tells me where I need to 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.050
 what to play I have to adapt 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.430
 in the first team 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.790
 the first team like the cop I 'm not going to 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.750
 give 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.750
 even 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.740
 if I try where the best I can 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.600
 because it persists damp where I want 4 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.480
 controversialist has conversational shots 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 a line but 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.970
 as for an authentic surprise or not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.540
 according to apparently the opportunity of a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.540
 front shot 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.440
 I like to get there from 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.440
 from outside the area and sorry 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 play keep improving and especially in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 team 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.770
 minutes to work 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.230
 there last one finished is that very well 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.090
 this is being the pressure on the part of 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.940
 the season with the first team not 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 this is an evolution in serious the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.810
 work is better I try to give everything 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.620
 in principle it is too early to see the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.850
 love 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.870
 5 adapt the equipment 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.870
 the player is quite powerful 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:13.390
 in 90 minutes on Saturday game with the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.390
 subsidiary with an option 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.640
 morning and a break 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.060
 we will try to recover the greeting of a 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.410
 roundabout 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.410
 look at the life of marcos senna
