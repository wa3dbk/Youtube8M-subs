00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.400
 acceptable result but good color 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.280

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.820
 of three hands to get this color 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.700

 Spring in winter in the stretches 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.510

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.780
 always to my life abandons to see that I have 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.100

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.740
 videographer and I did not have and I tried it I give myself 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.510
 mind that is a little bit exaggerated with 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.000
 this eye makeup but good to me 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.250

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.690

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.890
 effect on the nails or that it gets 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.030
 on top of another and this is this effect 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.580

 It is a greenish blue light oil color 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.150

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.720
 but beautiful I love but this other 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.130

 of this effect of create this 3d effect to 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:11.039
