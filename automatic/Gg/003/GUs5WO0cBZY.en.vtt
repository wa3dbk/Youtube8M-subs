00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.310
 young people go around sport park jaspers 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 another competition for the Achterhoek Cup 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 Winterswijk against Fox Field 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.809
 tuesday evening it was a lot of fun 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 match trias against silvolde 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.850
 the expectation here was that it was one 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.900
 would be walk-over by the scores of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.900
 eight zero 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 trance it was hoped it ran for a while 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.179
 different 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.270
 replay ball from eric redecker of kai 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.080
 reed thatcher stands for so much 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.080
 we go this into that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.960
 it was a match yes what should you do there 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.960
 of saying nice cross 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:14.140
 much took place at half of it 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:17.310
 hefty fill the table 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.310
 they were still right 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.820
 180 but yes the score will increase 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 that is the big question 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.870
 audience was still quite a bit 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.220
 large numbers 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.220
 deliver quite well 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.430
 and of course great hilarity 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.550
 referee and without further damage 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.550
 can 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.850
 free kick 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.850
 brought a lot for it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 new for say 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.860
 defense of both gets the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.860
 trees that leave the penalty area 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.090
 on a new attempt 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.470
 it can't help 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.320
 nicely turned away 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.180
 come 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.650
 you are the images that this is 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.569
 Significantly many stars guest on 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.489
 faso 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.310
 to the second ball in field and it would be something 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.319
 those who measure must kick away 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.590
 it is rewarded with 10 minutes of the 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.590
 field 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.330
 another attack 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.980
 pace was not high lay mountain low 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.360
 store 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.360
 I'm sure the ball won't get away 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.750
 out of the way 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.480
 certain questions do kick a few 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.890
 highlights but it stayed there 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.530
 already a bit up 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.650
 the first half went may day I have to 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.650
 say 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.659
 well kept 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.409
 polite again and then in that area 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.409
 circling 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:41.510
 attempt again attempt to get kicked 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.490
 I 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.200
 varsseveld will try to come true 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.200
 but also be intercepted 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:18.090
 print 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:21.019
 myself and it is already half an hour 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.019
 twice 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.570
 the keeper of van wish they could 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.190
 balls he count from the with the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.139
 throw away your hand 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.380
 it was usually a long free kick that 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.040
 promptly intercepted by 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.040
 players from winterswijk 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.860
 occasionally vosseveld came up for a moment 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.860
 goal of winterswijk 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.569
 you go keeper would put him neatly and that 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:18.130
 then of course a long flight of stairs 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:18.130
 forward something so good 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.380
 makes room 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.510
 otherwise had no air 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.180
 then indicated to train 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.210
 that we arrange the highlights 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.210
 the match 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.030
 on banter in the 16-meter area 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.030
 that often lead to nothing 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.919
 first pick it up may be reasonable 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.610
 to see the second half was really yes 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.610
 sleep-inducing 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.889
 Penal slowly in that area which again 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.889
 lead to nothing 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.890
 yes your goals where english 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.860
 nice misses 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.300
 long shot 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.330
 and again the long stairs forward and sometimes 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.460
 you in hope of blessing but just the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.000
 goalkeeper db 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.000
 nice promotion 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.680
 space law study type road minutes de 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.680
 sit down 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.260
 hand over a shirt 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.320
 he keep joke say behind the ears 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.340
 because I have done nothing and the 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.020
 substitute keeper 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.460
 or he does n't do it badly either 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.850
 were a bit higher there 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.850
 density 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.600
 another nice miss at one 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.560
 long shot 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.560
 comes in two times three
