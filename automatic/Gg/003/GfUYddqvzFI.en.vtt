00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
that measurement is and that's how you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.830 
that measurement is and that's how you
take<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.320> measurement<00:03:12.180> other<00:03:13.180> measurements

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
take that measurement other measurements

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.800 
take that measurement other measurements
you<00:03:13.930> could<00:03:14.080> take<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.560> your<00:03:15.070> thigh<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.450> you

you could take is your thigh so you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.560 
you could take is your thigh so you
could<00:03:16.990> do<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.670> again<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.700> by<00:03:19.060> shimming<00:03:19.450> it

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
could do that again just by shimming it

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.130 
could do that again just by shimming it
up<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> it's<00:03:20.470> always<00:03:20.650> best<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.660> give<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
up and it's always best to give the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.590 
up and it's always best to give the
largest<00:03:23.710> area<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.060> that's<00:03:25.180> usually

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
largest area so and that's usually

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.820

that's<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.600> measurement<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.840> next

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
that's the measurement the next

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.600 
that's the measurement the next
measurement<00:05:20.560> we're<00:05:20.979> going<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.160> take<00:05:21.400> is

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
measurement we're going to take is

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.540 
measurement we're going to take is
across<00:05:22.599> your<00:05:22.810> back<00:05:25.289> so<00:05:26.289> that<00:05:26.320> is<00:05:27.070> shoulder

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
across your back so that is shoulder

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.790 
across your back so that is shoulder
point<00:05:27.789> to<00:05:27.910> shoulder<00:05:28.270> point<00:05:28.560> straight<00:05:29.560> across

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
point to shoulder point straight across

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:38.070 
point to shoulder point straight across
the<00:05:30.070> back<00:05:32.550> just<00:05:33.550> like<00:05:33.699> that<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:37.180> for<00:05:37.389> an<00:05:37.509> inseam

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
the back just like that so for an inseam

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.210 
the back just like that so for an inseam
the<00:05:38.380> way<00:05:38.500> we're<00:05:38.680> going<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:38.860> take<00:05:39.070> that

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
the way we're going to take that

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.790 
the way we're going to take that
measurement<00:05:39.430> is<00:05:39.759> get<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.120> measuring<00:05:40.479> tape

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
measurement is get the measuring tape

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.140 
measurement is get the measuring tape
put<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:41.949> as<00:05:42.690> far<00:05:43.690> to<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:45.280> top<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:45.789> thigh<00:05:45.940> as

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
put it as far to the top of the thigh as

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.930 
put it as far to the top of the thigh as
you<00:05:46.240> can<00:05:46.449> and<00:05:46.660> then<00:05:47.560> just<00:05:48.280> run<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.580> measuring

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
you can and then just run the measuring

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.659 
you can and then just run the measuring
tape<00:05:49.090> down<00:05:49.419> your<00:05:49.660> leg<00:05:49.919> to<00:05:50.919> whatever<00:05:51.400> the

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
tape down your leg to whatever the

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.279 
tape down your leg to whatever the
desired<00:05:51.970> length<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:52.479> want<00:05:52.630> it<00:05:52.720> to<00:05:52.900> be<00:05:53.050> and

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
desired length you want it to be and

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.170 
desired length you want it to be and
it's<00:05:53.710> very<00:05:53.889> important<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.400> your<00:05:54.639> knees<00:05:54.820> bent

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
it's very important that your knees bent

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.420 
it's very important that your knees bent
because<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.260> gives<00:05:56.530> you<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.860> length<00:05:57.039> that

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
because that gives you the length that

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.390 
because that gives you the length that
you<00:05:57.580> need<00:05:57.610> for<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.900> sitting<00:05:59.889> position<00:06:02.400> another

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
you need for a sitting position another

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.279 
you need for a sitting position another
measurement<00:06:03.820> we<00:06:04.120> can<00:06:04.300> take<00:06:04.570> is<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:06.639> torso

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
measurement we can take is the torso

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.930 
measurement we can take is the torso
some<00:06:08.289> people<00:06:08.650> are<00:06:09.010> short<00:06:09.340> waisted<00:06:09.789> high

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
some people are short waisted high

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.110 
some people are short waisted high
waisted<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:11.560> we<00:06:11.680> need<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:11.889> know<00:06:12.039> that<00:06:15.120> start

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
waisted so we need to know that start

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.760 
waisted so we need to know that start
the<00:06:16.270> measuring<00:06:16.570> tape<00:06:16.780> from<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.289> middle<00:06:17.590> of

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
the measuring tape from the middle of

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.790 
the measuring tape from the middle of
the<00:06:18.250> shoulder<00:06:20.820> over<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:21.940> chest<00:06:22.240> in<00:06:22.690> the

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
the shoulder over the chest in the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.399 
the shoulder over the chest in the
center<00:06:23.820> to<00:06:24.820> the<00:06:24.970> waist<00:06:25.650> and<00:06:27.599> that's<00:06:28.599> how<00:06:29.349> we

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
center to the waist and that's how we

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.350 
center to the waist and that's how we
get<00:06:29.680> that<00:06:31.919> another<00:06:32.919> measurement<00:06:33.360> sometimes

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
get that another measurement sometimes

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.060 
get that another measurement sometimes
that's<00:06:34.570> required<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:35.169> depends<00:06:35.620> on<00:06:35.680> what

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
that's required it depends on what

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.249 
that's required it depends on what
garment<00:06:36.490> is<00:06:36.610> being<00:06:36.940> made<00:06:37.120> is<00:06:37.360> to<00:06:38.110> measure

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
garment is being made is to measure

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.680 
garment is being made is to measure
across<00:06:38.470> the<00:06:38.860> front<00:06:39.159> and<00:06:39.400> that's<00:06:40.210> usually

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
across the front and that's usually

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.219 
across the front and that's usually
taken<00:06:41.110> about<00:06:41.500> two<00:06:41.889> inches<00:06:42.250> below<00:06:42.849> the<00:06:43.360> top<00:06:44.020> of

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
taken about two inches below the top of

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.320 
taken about two inches below the top of
the<00:06:44.440> shoulder<00:06:44.830> and<00:06:44.979> then<00:06:45.909> just<00:06:46.150> straight

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
the shoulder and then just straight

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.180 
the shoulder and then just straight
across<00:06:47.430> and<00:06:49.020> an<00:06:50.020> easy<00:06:50.409> way<00:06:50.680> to<00:06:50.710> know<00:06:50.860> where

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
across and an easy way to know where

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.159 
across and an easy way to know where
that<00:06:51.340> line<00:06:51.610> is<00:06:51.669> is<00:06:52.180> usually<00:06:52.419> where<00:06:52.870> there's<00:06:53.110> a

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
that line is is usually where there's a

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.260 
that line is is usually where there's a
seam<00:06:53.530> if<00:06:53.800> you're<00:06:54.250> wearing<00:06:54.550> something<00:06:54.789> and<00:06:55.180> it

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
seam if you're wearing something and it

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.200 
seam if you're wearing something and it
has<00:06:55.419> a<00:06:55.450> seam<00:06:56.200> like<00:06:56.469> this<00:06:56.849> that's<00:06:57.849> where<00:06:58.120> the

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
has a seam like this that's where the

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.590 
has a seam like this that's where the
tape<00:06:58.419> starts<00:06:58.750> and<00:06:59.139> on<00:06:59.440> the

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
tape starts and on the

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.250 
tape starts and on the
other<00:06:59.750> side<00:06:59.930> is<00:07:00.080> where<00:07:00.230> it<00:07:00.320> ends<00:07:00.620> and<00:07:00.770> that's

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
other side is where it ends and that's

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.070 
other side is where it ends and that's
that<00:07:03.260> measurement<00:07:03.590> and<00:07:04.630> those<00:07:05.630> are<00:07:05.870> all<00:07:06.050> the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
that measurement and those are all the

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.840 
that measurement and those are all the
basic<00:07:06.380> measurements<00:07:07.100> and<00:07:07.600> how<00:07:08.600> to<00:07:08.660> take<00:07:08.900> them
