design tinkering during the course of
the<00:01:19.409> last<00:01:19.590> 20<00:01:19.979> years<00:01:20.039> we've<00:01:20.399> seen<00:01:20.579> surfing

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the last 20 years we've seen surfing

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.779 
the last 20 years we've seen surfing
change<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.749> much<00:01:22.219> you<00:01:23.219> know<00:01:23.340> obviously<00:01:23.639> the

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
change so much you know obviously the

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.989 
change so much you know obviously the
younger<00:01:24.060> generation<00:01:25.579> starting<00:01:26.579> out<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.819> such

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
younger generation starting out on such

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.489 
younger generation starting out on such
small<00:01:27.270> equipment<00:01:27.539> I<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.469> are

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
small equipment I don't think they are

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.319 
small equipment I don't think they are
able<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.310> make<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> transition<00:01:30.179> to<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
able to really make a transition to a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.080 
able to really make a transition to a
bigger<00:01:30.600> board<00:01:30.929> so<00:01:31.770> boards<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.159> shorter<00:01:32.670> yeah

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
bigger board so boards that shorter yeah

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.769 
bigger board so boards that shorter yeah
and<00:01:33.899> for<00:01:34.590> me<00:01:34.709> I<00:01:34.740> always<00:01:35.310> felt<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.029> wanted

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
and for me I always felt like I wanted

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.739 
and for me I always felt like I wanted
to<00:01:37.020> draw<00:01:37.289> one<00:01:37.560> long<00:01:38.130> continuous<00:01:38.159> line<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
to draw one long continuous line or you

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.510 
to draw one long continuous line or you
know<00:01:39.869> figure<00:01:40.229> eight<00:01:40.409> sort<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.859> off<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> bottom

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
know figure eight sort of off the bottom

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.199 
know figure eight sort of off the bottom
all<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.909> through<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.299> top<00:01:42.479> turn<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:44.209> you

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
all the way through the top turn and you

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
all the way through the top turn and you
know<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.630> I've<00:01:45.749> noticed<00:01:45.959> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
know that's what I've noticed the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889 
know that's what I've noticed the
differences<00:01:46.709> between<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:48.359> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.779> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
differences between the you know the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
differences between the you know the
guys<00:01:49.049> riding<00:01:49.319> shorter<00:01:49.709> boards<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.130> there

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
guys riding shorter boards is there

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.129 
guys riding shorter boards is there
they're<00:01:50.669> doing<00:01:50.999> multiple<00:01:51.509> stage<00:01:51.689> bottom

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
they're doing multiple stage bottom

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.239 
they're doing multiple stage bottom
turns<00:01:52.399> for<00:01:53.399> being<00:01:53.609> a<00:01:53.849> way<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.929> you<00:01:55.859> know<00:01:55.979> can

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
turns for being a way that you know can

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.919 
turns for being a way that you know can
handle<00:01:56.579> fifteen<00:01:56.999> feet<00:01:57.209> it's<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> really

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
handle fifteen feet it's a really

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:58.779 
handle fifteen feet it's a really
high-performance

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789

such a incredible craftsman he just you
know<00:02:44.980> he<00:02:45.069> was<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:46.150> think<00:02:46.480> as<00:02:46.599> determined<00:02:47.110> as<00:02:47.170> I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
know he was I think as determined as I

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.910 
know he was I think as determined as I
was<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.890> find<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.340> magic<00:02:48.840> formula<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.349> so<00:02:50.590> we

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
was to find that magic formula and so we

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.059 
was to find that magic formula and so we
went<00:02:51.099> you<00:02:51.519> know<00:02:51.549> wider<00:02:51.880> thicker<00:02:52.860> went<00:02:53.860> to

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
went you know wider thicker went to

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.330 
went you know wider thicker went to
narrow<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:55.959> made<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> dummy<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.190> did

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
narrow it you know made a dummy we did

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.800 
narrow it you know made a dummy we did
so<00:02:57.519> many<00:02:57.640> different<00:02:57.760> things<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.450> about

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
so many different things to it about

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.800 
so many different things to it about
eight<00:02:58.989> years<00:02:59.170> ago<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.560> think<00:02:59.769> tom<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.750> maybe<00:03:01.750> a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
eight years ago I think tom is maybe a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.600 
eight years ago I think tom is maybe a
little<00:03:01.959> less<00:03:02.140> more<00:03:02.440> like<00:03:02.560> six<00:03:02.829> years<00:03:02.920> ago<00:03:03.130> I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
little less more like six years ago I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
little less more like six years ago I
think<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.560> know<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:06.060> finally<00:03:07.060> stumbled

it's a beautiful little double concave I

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.599 
it's a beautiful little double concave I
tend<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> like<00:03:46.989> boards<00:03:47.680> bigger<00:03:47.920> than<00:03:48.130> 700<00:03:48.579> I

stable you know there's a lot of chop
all<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.739> power<00:03:59.950> at<00:04:00.069> sunset<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:00.819> I<00:04:01.060> think<00:04:01.599> the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
all the power at sunset so I think the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.319 
all the power at sunset so I think the
wave<00:04:01.959> itself<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.920> know<00:04:03.010> really<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:03.329> it

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
wave itself you know really just it

and you see the inside bowl and it's

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.520 
and you see the inside bowl and it's
just<00:04:16.060> everything<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.900> know<00:04:17.049> paddling<00:04:17.440> out

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
just everything you know paddling out

through that that channel going over
giant<00:04:20.440> current<00:04:21.010> chops<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.670> look<00:04:22.420> at<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.720> wave

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
giant current chops and look at the wave

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.640 
giant current chops and look at the wave
as<00:04:24.150> just<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.270> experience<00:04:25.720> primarily<00:04:26.230> sunset

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
was more of a focal point

think as the wave is so unpredictable
