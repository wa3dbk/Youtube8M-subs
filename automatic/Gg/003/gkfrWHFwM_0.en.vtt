looking<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.369> our<00:00:23.429> plans<00:00:23.759> we've<00:00:24.509> got<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> top

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
looking at our plans we've got the top

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220 
looking at our plans we've got the top
and<00:00:25.289> bottom<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.070> ends<00:00:26.490> two<00:00:27.150> dividers<00:00:27.480> four

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and bottom the ends two dividers four

shelves<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.859> two<00:00:29.189> back<00:00:29.460> panels<00:00:29.999> now<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.539> have

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
shelves and two back panels now we have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.779 
shelves and two back panels now we have
a<00:00:30.720> lot<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> matching<00:00:31.499> pieces<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.130> here's<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> tip

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
a lot of matching pieces so here's a tip

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.700 
a lot of matching pieces so here's a tip
to<00:00:32.910> save<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.329> cutting<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:33.840> take<00:00:34.440> two

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to save you some cutting time take two

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
to save you some cutting time take two
pieces<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.250> plywood<00:00:35.430> sandwich<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.360> together

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
pieces of plywood sandwich them together

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
pieces of plywood sandwich them together
and<00:00:36.809> secure<00:00:37.079> them<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.289> screws<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.070> way<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and secure them with screws that way we

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
and secure them with screws that way we
can<00:00:38.460> cut<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:39.030> pieces<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.510> once<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.170> I'll

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
can cut two pieces at once but I'll

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.439 
can cut two pieces at once but I'll
start<00:00:40.649> by<00:00:40.860> marking<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.699> my<00:00:41.850> parts<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
start by marking all of my parts on the

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.119 
start by marking all of my parts on the
top<00:00:42.660> layer<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> that'll<00:00:43.649> show<00:00:43.800> me<00:00:43.949> where<00:00:44.100> my

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
top layer and that'll show me where my

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.010 
top layer and that'll show me where my
waste<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.239> where<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.449> put<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> screws

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
waste is that's where I put the screws

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.510 
waste is that's where I put the screws
so<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.199> don't<00:00:46.410> Mar<00:00:46.620> anything<00:00:47.010> I'll<00:00:47.129> use<00:00:47.309> later

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so I don't Mar anything I'll use later

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
so I don't Mar anything I'll use later
at<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.570> point<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:48.930> probably<00:00:48.960> looking<00:00:49.440> at

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
at this point you're probably looking at

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
at this point you're probably looking at
this<00:00:49.649> full<00:00:49.859> sheet<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.100> plywood<00:00:50.399> saying<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.000> do

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this full sheet of plywood saying how do

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
this full sheet of plywood saying how do
I<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> table<00:00:51.989> salt<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I get this to the table salt well you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.259 
I get this to the table salt well you
don't<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.940> we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> use

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
don't have to because we're going to use

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.990 
don't have to because we're going to use
a<00:00:54.390> circular<00:00:54.750> saw<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.440> cut<00:00:55.829> oversized<00:00:56.399> blanks

and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:57.269> take<00:00:57.390> those<00:00:57.510> blanks<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and then we'll take those blanks to the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
and then we'll take those blanks to the
table<00:00:58.469> saw<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> good<00:00:59.250> smooth<00:00:59.579> cut<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.420> I'll

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
table saw for a good smooth cut but I'll

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.349 
table saw for a good smooth cut but I'll
start<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:01.350> making<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.829> circular<00:01:02.160> saw<00:01:02.579> guide<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
start by making a circular saw guide and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.960 
start by making a circular saw guide and
to<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.870> I'll<00:01:04.110> measure<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> edge<00:01:05.549> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to do this I'll measure from the edge of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.390 
to do this I'll measure from the edge of
the<00:01:06.299> circular<00:01:06.630> saw<00:01:06.780> base<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> blade<00:01:07.920> then

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the circular saw base to the blade then

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
the circular saw base to the blade then
I<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.729> cut<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.119> scrap<00:01:09.450> pieces<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.020> size

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
I can cut two scrap pieces to that size

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
I can cut two scrap pieces to that size
that<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.220> whenever<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.909> but

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that I can use whenever I want but

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.910 
that I can use whenever I want but
remember<00:01:12.689> any<00:01:12.840> time<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.259> use<00:01:13.380> power<00:01:13.650> tools

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
remember any time you use power tools

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890

always wear eye protection and hearing

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.380 
always wear eye protection and hearing
protection<00:01:16.229> I'll<00:01:16.920> use<00:01:17.250> these<00:01:17.460> guides<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.210> find

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
protection I'll use these guides to find

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
protection I'll use these guides to find
the<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.780> placement<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.500> my<00:01:19.590> fence<00:01:19.950> which

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the right placement for my fence which

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.560 
the right placement for my fence which
in<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.400> case<00:01:20.579> is<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> 1<00:01:21.329> by<00:01:21.540> 4

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
in this case is going to be a 1 by 4

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.810 
in this case is going to be a 1 by 4
that<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.079> clamp<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.740> plywood<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.610> I'll

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that I clamp to my plywood then I'll

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
that I clamp to my plywood then I'll
just<00:01:23.970> run<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> circular<00:01:24.659> saw<00:01:24.840> off<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.079> edge

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just run the circular saw off the edge

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
just run the circular saw off the edge
of<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.799> fence<00:01:26.100> once<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:27.150> cut<00:01:27.329> is<00:01:27.450> done

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
of that fence once my first cut is done

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
of that fence once my first cut is done
I<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.960> reposition<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.650> guide<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> fence

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
I can reposition the guide and the fence

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.880 
I can reposition the guide and the fence

I'll<00:01:57.840> use<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> pocket<00:01:58.680> hole<00:01:59.009> jig<00:01:59.039> to<00:01:59.340> make<00:01:59.369> those

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I'll use a pocket hole jig to make those

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
I'll use a pocket hole jig to make those
I'm<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> use<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.600> smaller

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
I'm going to use this the smaller

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
I'm going to use this the smaller
version<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.829> easier<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.250> larger

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
version because it's easier on larger

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
version because it's easier on larger
pieces<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.509> I'm<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> use

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
pieces like this I'm also going to use

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.560 
pieces like this I'm also going to use
this<00:02:04.829> iron-on<00:02:05.490> veneer<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.329> plywood

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
this iron-on veneer for our plywood

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.720 
this iron-on veneer for our plywood
pieces<00:02:06.990> it'll<00:02:07.799> help<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.070> cover<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.580> rough

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
pieces it'll help to cover up the rough

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.520 
pieces it'll help to cover up the rough
exposed<00:02:09.150> edge<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.720> give<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.870> a<00:02:09.930> cleaner<00:02:10.260> look

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
exposed edge and give it a cleaner look

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.320

now<00:02:10.980> for<00:02:11.160> each<00:02:11.370> edge<00:02:11.610> I'll<00:02:11.880> measure<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
now for each edge I'll measure the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.530 
now for each edge I'll measure the
length<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:12.960> I'll<00:02:13.080> cut<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
length and then I'll cut a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.300 
length and then I'll cut a
near<00:02:13.689> one<00:02:14.079> inch<00:02:14.379> longer<00:02:14.739> than<00:02:15.099> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
near one inch longer than that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.399 
near one inch longer than that
measurement<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.299> can<00:02:16.450> attach<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.870> using<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
measurement then I can attach it using a

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.530

keep the iron moving down the length of
the<00:02:21.459> veneer<00:02:21.760> once<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.329> ironed<00:02:22.599> on<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:23.230> use

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the veneer once it's ironed on I can use

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
the veneer once it's ironed on I can use
a<00:02:23.379> utility<00:02:23.950> knife<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.159> cut<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.609> to<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.760> exact
