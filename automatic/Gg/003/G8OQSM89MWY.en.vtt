have<00:01:43.900> like<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.260> TWA<00:01:44.940> or<00:01:45.940> like<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.160> did<00:01:54.760> like

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
have like the TWA or like but I did like

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.620

up<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.630> sometimes<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> candle<00:02:23.860> moves

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
up like sometimes like the candle moves

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.370 
up like sometimes like the candle moves
like<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.370> white<00:02:25.000> residue<00:02:25.600> on<00:02:25.750> my<00:02:25.900> hair<00:02:26.140> but<00:02:26.320> I

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
like a white residue on my hair but I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.870 
like a white residue on my hair but I

this<00:02:28.450> one<00:02:28.660> doesn't<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:30.340> noticed

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
this one doesn't do that but I noticed

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.229 
this one doesn't do that but I noticed
that<00:02:31.239> um<00:02:31.739> when<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.769> did<00:02:33.070> my<00:02:33.220> twist<00:02:33.550> outs<00:02:33.760> waiting

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
that um when I did my twist outs waiting

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.699 
that um when I did my twist outs waiting
it<00:02:34.390> didn't<00:02:34.810> last<00:02:35.050> as<00:02:35.440> long<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:37.680> when<00:02:38.680> I

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
it didn't last as long so when I

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.400 
it didn't last as long so when I
recommend<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.670> definitely<00:02:40.269> would<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.380> I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
recommend it I definitely would but I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.650 
recommend it I definitely would but I
would<00:02:41.709> say<00:02:41.980> use<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.060> as<00:02:43.269> what<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.780> says<00:02:44.680> new

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
would say use it as what it says new

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.530 
would say use it as what it says new
conditioner<00:02:46.690> don't<00:02:47.019> lose<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.360> that's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
conditioner don't lose it so that's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.920
