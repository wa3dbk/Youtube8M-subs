why Floyd Floyd doesn't mention Jessie

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.820 
why Floyd Floyd doesn't mention Jessie
Vargas<00:02:11.220> anymore<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:11.970> Jessie<00:02:12.720> Vargas

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
Vargas anymore is because Jessie Vargas

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.480 
Vargas anymore is because Jessie Vargas
left<00:02:14.010> him<00:02:14.660> well<00:02:15.660> 12<00:02:16.290> Floyd<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.250> jail

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
left him well 12 Floyd was in jail

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.350 
left him well 12 Floyd was in jail
Jessie<00:02:18.330> Vargas<00:02:18.480> decided<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.410> move<00:02:19.860> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
Jessie Vargas decided to move to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240 
Jessie Vargas decided to move to
top-ranked<00:02:21.360> Bob<00:02:21.750> Arum<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:22.590> Floyd<00:02:22.920> was<00:02:23.100> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
top-ranked Bob Arum well Floyd was in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
top-ranked Bob Arum well Floyd was in
jail<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.730> that's<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> reason<00:02:24.090> why<00:02:24.360> Floyd

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
jail so that's the reason why Floyd

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.430 
jail so that's the reason why Floyd
hasn't<00:02:25.140> has<00:02:25.350> never<00:02:25.650> mentioned<00:02:27.290> Jessie<00:02:28.290> Vargas
