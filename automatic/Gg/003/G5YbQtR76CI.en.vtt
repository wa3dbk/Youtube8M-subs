00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
transition for the last four and a half

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
transition for the last four and a half
years<00:00:51.710> that's<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> last<00:00:53.100> four<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> half

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
years that's the last four and a half

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
years that's the last four and a half
years<00:00:54.120> ago<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> last<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> perm

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
years ago as the last time I got a perm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.750 
years ago as the last time I got a perm
and<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> I've<00:00:57.960> been<00:00:58.320> doing<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.730> know

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and so I've been doing it you know

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
and so I've been doing it you know
naturally<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:02.219> wanted<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.170> see<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
naturally and I wanted to see if it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.660 
naturally and I wanted to see if it
would<00:01:05.640> probably<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.479> idea<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.979> cut

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
would probably be a good idea if I cut

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200 
would probably be a good idea if I cut
my<00:01:08.939> ends<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.400> still<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> couple<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
my ends because I still have a couple of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
my ends because I still have a couple of
inches<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:13.430> firm<00:01:14.430> dins<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.560> my<00:01:16.560> mom<00:01:16.799> thinks

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
inches of firm dins and my mom thinks

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.480 
inches of firm dins and my mom thinks
that<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> should<00:01:17.759> cut<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.009> don't<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that I should cut them I don't want to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.249 
that I should cut them I don't want to
because<00:01:21.090> I've<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:22.850> roommate<00:01:23.850> who<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
because I've had a roommate who was a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.120 
because I've had a roommate who was a
hair<00:01:26.159> stylist<00:01:26.850> who<00:01:27.030> told<00:01:27.270> me<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:29.100> know

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
hair stylist who told me that I you know

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580 
hair stylist who told me that I you know
you<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.180> cut<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.630> ends<00:01:31.259> just

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you don't have to cut your ends just

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.609 
you don't have to cut your ends just
because<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.579> damaged<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:34.229> go

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
because they're damaged they will go

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
because they're damaged they will go
away<00:01:34.650> by<00:01:35.100> themselves<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.939> actually<00:01:36.150> makes

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
away by themselves and it actually makes

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
away by themselves and it actually makes
your<00:01:36.810> hair<00:01:36.990> grow<00:01:37.200> faster<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.460> I've

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
your hair grow faster but then I've

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730 
your hair grow faster but then I've
heard<00:01:38.970> people<00:01:39.450> say<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> cut<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
heard people say that if you cut your

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.280 
heard people say that if you cut your
ends<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:42.150> makes<00:01:42.570> sure<00:01:42.869> hair<00:01:43.079> grow

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
ends off that makes sure hair grow

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.350 
ends off that makes sure hair grow
faster<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> cut<00:01:45.210> my

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to take a poll I guess to see if it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.410 
to take a poll I guess to see if it
would<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.280> idea<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:12.230> cut<00:02:13.230> my

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
would be a good idea to cut my

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.800 
would be a good idea to cut my
in<00:02:13.540> or<00:02:14.080> should<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:15.190> just<00:02:15.220> let<00:02:15.610> them<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:16.690> know

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
in or should I just let them you know

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.430 
in or should I just let them you know
fall<00:02:17.650> off<00:02:17.680> by<00:02:18.010> themselves<00:02:19.050> what<00:02:20.050> would<00:02:20.230> be<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
fall off by themselves what would be a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.380 
fall off by themselves what would be a
better<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:21.599> solution<00:02:23.040> um<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:25.239> reason

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
better you know solution um the reason

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.720 
better you know solution um the reason
why<00:02:25.810> my<00:02:26.080> mom<00:02:26.290> thinks<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:26.980> should<00:02:27.069> cut<00:02:27.610> off

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
why my mom thinks that I should cut off

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.640 
why my mom thinks that I should cut off
my<00:02:27.970> hands<00:02:28.120> because<00:02:28.599> she<00:02:28.780> says<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.440> they're

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
my hands because she says that they're

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.780 
my hands because she says that they're
really<00:02:30.280> ugly<00:02:31.080> because<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.290> see<00:02:32.560> how<00:02:32.890> my<00:02:33.489> hair

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
really ugly because you see how my hair

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.140 
really ugly because you see how my hair
is<00:02:33.819> curly<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:36.040> then<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.880> ends<00:02:38.730> she<00:02:39.730> said<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
is curly but then the ends she said the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.770 
is curly but then the ends she said the
