 the best audio information 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 professional djs and instruments 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.160
 musicals this time I 've 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 prepared a tutorial for people 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.310
 that have the driver for djs 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.480
 of bering in the cmd studio 4a is a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.080
 installation 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.630
 with the tractor 2 which is the software for 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.520
 djs to be able to configure in first 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.579
 place you have to go to the page of 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 berlinger and you are looking for the product I 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.040
 study 4a and you have to download 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.989
 where it says apps you download this cmd 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.440
 studio 4 tsi and study 4 a windows 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 driver 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.449
 this is a file of the cmd studio 4 hs 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.239
 and it is the file so that the tractor 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.489
 your controller can recognize what 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 the users we call 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.930
 we say the map this is the map in the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 ts file and for what is the tractor and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.690
 this is the driver the acid driver is 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 say so I can recognize your 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:20.120
 sound card that comes integrated 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.120
 link m of study 4a 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 already having this the next step is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.070
 you double click on the folder of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.030
 sm studio 4a and we will install the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.210
 driver do another click on setup we go to 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210
 watch 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.910
 we put next 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910
 we install 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.259
 to take prudent time to be able 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.259
 install the driver 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.830
 and here tells you to connect tcm of 4 to the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.830
 let's proceed to connect 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.840
 I put accept 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.899
 and we have to wait to recognize it 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.660
 and everything is ok then well it came out 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.850
 this is not power you can not have 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.230
 access to windows man skream I'm going to put 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.230
 execute anyway 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.610
 and I have him 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.610
 has been driver installed 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.470
 to know what message came out 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.230
 the next step is to open the tractor 2 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.670
 I recommend you always use the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.130
 latest version of the tractor that we have 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.770
 to avoid incompatibilities so that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.720
 work very well happily that the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.540
 native instruments is always going to 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.300
 provide will take out updates 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.350
 often good I have in this 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.600
 case I have the demo 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.990
 what we are going to do is let's go to 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.990
 file 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 in preferences and at the end of 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.770
 preferences says imports here in matter 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.770
 we click 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.590
 and let's look for the file in remember 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.130
 that tsi file that we downloaded, I left it 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.250
 in my text 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.430
 we double click and this is the file 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.890
 tsi that will read the tractor the s4 a 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.890
 version 1.0 we double click 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.100
 we click again again ok because what 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.280
 what is going to map is the control of 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.640
 controller mapping the driver better 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.640
 said and the other option is to go 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.150
 to control manager that is at the end of 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.580
 this screen 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.610
 and we select in device 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.900
 we select the s 4 a mapping 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.690
 and in import we select the cmd studio 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.519
 4a 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.910
 in the author cmd study 4a 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.360
 and we're going to see that I'm moving the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.659
 knobs that has already been mapped you have 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.849
 that follow these steps then right now 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:35.189
 I'm moving the knobs 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.619
 of the highs the means and the 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.869
 serious so you can see that it is mapped 

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:42.749
 this is the map made by the people of 

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:45.899
 berlinger obviously there are many 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:48.899
 users that make their map according to their 

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:51.370
 seem or your taste since you can 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:55.860
 Modify 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:59.099
 according to your use this is he 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.770
 the standard mapping now to finish 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.889
 you have to go to file to configure the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.099
 audio card put stage audio and in 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.949
 good device audi has several options 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:13.909
 and the one that we should choose the cmd studio 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.909
 4 asia 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.720
 Well, it's right now with the 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.600
 cmd berlinger configuration 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.660
 4 action study 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.110
 and in albu routing we are going to connect the 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.250
 output master which is the main output 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:39.100
 appears study 4 to 1 and 2 and in the case 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:44.140
 to connect your hearing aids you are going to put 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:47.560
 study 3 and 4 which is the exit for 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.870
 your hearing aids for your monitoring 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.520
 then we have already configured what 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.419
 is the map and the audio card 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.880
