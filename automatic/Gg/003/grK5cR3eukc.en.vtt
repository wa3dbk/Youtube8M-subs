00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.039
 good evening dear friends today with 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.619
 you video killers my new show 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.390
 just the fast review video in which 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.759
 speed i will say my opinion on 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.619
 this or that game today under the distribution 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.320
 hitman absolution 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.450
 The game was released relatively recently, but I already 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.110
 managed to get acquainted with it and even go through 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.120
 her game is a direct sequel 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.579
 predecessor released 6 years ago 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.950
 namely hitman blood money but what 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.800
 can provide a game surviving later 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.129
 six years seeing as we remember but many 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.839
 it was really ahirin oh game i am 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.440
 I can tell you that hitman absolution 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.929
 still as meet expectations if I 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 compared it with the previous parts then I 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.999
 would say she was a little behind 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.460
 hitman blood money in the plan 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:08.120
 don't even know just in terms of my 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:11.080
 nostalgia oh yes now completely different 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.360
 the case and the rest of the game is just great 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.210
 improved gameplay graphics oherenny 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.370
 thanks to a good game engine 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.560
 precisely the cruiser which without any 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.050
 problems cope with a lot of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.720
 people on the screen and very good about 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.970
 draws a terrain that gives the game a full 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.490
 the right to be compared with such a game as 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.800
 batman arkham city graphically 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.060
 but also the highlight of the program is of course 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.430
 story line 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.220
 Kidman slightly older but still 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 cool as before and maybe even cooler 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.570
 hitman absolution tells us 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.270
 personal contract history 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.520
 hired assassin is a dedicated agency and 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.640
 police hounded agent 47 is looking for 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.790
 redemption in spoiled and mutilated 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.520
 the city 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.920
 and with it, and you, and it is this 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.740
 The moment I want to ask you a question is how much 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.650
 lives are ready to take you to save 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.510
 one single and what kind of life goes on 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.060
 speech you will learn if play this 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.670
 the game and now hitman tries 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.310
 strangle a little fat water is not 3x 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.760
 from the movie the match is I probably let you down 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.600
 totals hitman it seems something went wrong 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.420
 and gave one important pro 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.310
 we plant in general, I would put this game 9 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.370
 and 5 points out of 10 possible 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 First of these 6 years, I have had very 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.320
 to miss our killer 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.480
 second, I think the game was a success 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.630
 third what could be better than a fight 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.020
 Danny trekho and hitman in one game I you 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.030
 i will say that this fight is me and drake but 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.880
