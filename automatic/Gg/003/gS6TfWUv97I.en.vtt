00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.382
 In this presentation, I will solve a few examples of network multiplication 

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:06.687
 In the next presentation, I will explain why the process was successful 

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:14.705
 Let's multiply 27x48 

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:18.772
 What we have to do is write 27 here 

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:20.481
 I will put both the 2 and 7 in two separate columns 

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.101
 I will write 48 on the right 

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:25.345
 And then draw a grid 

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:28.340
 This is what we call multiplication by network 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.064
 We put 2 in the column 

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.996
 And 7 in another column 

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:34.881
 4 will take a place in a row 

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:37.807
 And 8 as well 

00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:39.845
 The interesting thing about the network multiplication process 

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:42.712
 Is that you finally get all the complications at once 

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:44.930
 The issue is then resolved with all combinations 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.921
 In this case we do not have to switch and put numbers in hand 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.805
 Although there is a put in hand 

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:51.260
 But this is during the collection process 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.510
 This is the network 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.800
 We have to draw these countries here 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.322
 In the next explanation we will identify the reason for the success of these countries 

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:58.550
 Like this 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.310
 Now we are ready to strike 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.440
 7x4 = 28 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.230
 7x4 is equal to 28 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.310
 If we put in the boxes here 2 and 8 so 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.580
 2x4 = 8 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.380
 If we write 0, 8, so 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.690
 We now have 7x8 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.154
 7x8 = 56 

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:27.240
 If we write 5 and 6 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.490
 Finally, 2x8 = 16 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.800
 We write 1 and 6, so 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.750
 We have thus resolved the matter 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.532
 We are now ready for collection 

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:43.448
 What we have to do is go down the diagonals 

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:48.161
 This first diameter, which is the diameter of the individual, we have 6 here 

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:50.500
 We write 6 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 Then move on to the next diameter 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.600
 Which contains 6, 5, and 8 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.360
 This will be the diameter of dozens 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
 If 8 + 5 = 13 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.600
 13 + 6 = 19 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.695
 If we write 9 in the double digits here 

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:11.408
 And we put 1 that came from 19 in the hand above at the status of hundreds 

00:02:11.408 --> 00:02:13.900
 Because they are actually not 19, but 190 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.850
 Ie 19 in the status of dozens 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.580
 Anyway, we put 1 in hand 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.510
 We have 1 + 2 = 3 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.780
 3 + 8 = 11 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.620
 11 + 1 = 12 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.868
 We write 2 in the hundreds box 

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:32.020
 And we put 1 in hand when the status of thousands 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.806
 1 + 0 = 1 

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:37.210
 If we own one in the status of thousands, so 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.440
 We can now get the output 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:48.557
 27x48 = 1296 

00:02:48.557 --> 00:02:49.725
 Let us now solve a slightly more difficult issue 

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:56.156
 Require more preparation, to prove your success method 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.868
 Suppose we have 5479x 

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:04.197
 Let's put a number of 3 houses 

00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:09.650
 Let it be 787 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.548
 As we did in the previous question, we will make 4 columns 

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:15.603
 Column for 5, pillar for 4, pillar for 7, and another for 9 

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:22.140
 If we have 5479 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.132
 x787 

00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:26.555
 Each of the numbers will be in a row 

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:30.780
 787 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.560
 It will look like this 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.060
 Now we have to draw the grid 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.790
 I will draw the grid 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.050
 Each of the numbers will have its own column 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.830
 I will draw the columns so 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.714
 Each of these numbers will own his own class 

00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:50.931
 Row for 7 

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:53.757
 Row for 8 

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:56.255
 Description of this 7 

00:03:56.255 --> 00:03:58.900
 Then we will draw the diameters 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.470
 So 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.828
 Qatar, Tar 

00:04:03.828 --> 00:04:08.015
 3 diameters, 4 diameters 

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.024
 I think you got the idea 

00:04:09.024 --> 00:04:12.740
 We have two countries left 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.110
 We are ready to strike now 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.790
 9x7 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.970
 We will not do that on this side here 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.240
 We know multiplication tables 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.860
 9x7 = 63 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.640
 7x7 = 49 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.560
 4x7 = 28 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.470
 5x7 = 35 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.600
 Let me change the color 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.350
 9x8 = 72 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.210
 7x8 = 56 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.970
 4x8 = 32 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.850
 5x8 = 40 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.850
 I will change the color again 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.750
 9x7 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.050
 = 63 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.950
 7x7 = 49 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.290
 4x7 = 28 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.320
 And then 5x7 = 35 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.940
 So we have done all the beatings in the matter 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.210
 Now we will combine 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.860
 Let me find a suitable color for the combination 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.270
 Pink Color 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.520
 We will begin with the singular 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.005
 We have 3 here, we write 3 in the status of the individual 

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.730
 We turn to the double digits 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.830
 2 + 6 = 8 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.620
 8 + 9 = 17 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.072
 We write 7 in the position of dozens, and put 1 in the hand at the status of hundreds 

00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.692
 I wrote a small one 

00:05:35.692 --> 00:05:38.240
 1 + 3 = 4 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.930
 4 + 7 = 11 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.060
 11 + 6 = 17 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.590
 17 + 4 = 21 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.480
 21 + 8 = 29 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.780
 We write 9 in the status of hundreds, and we put 2 in the hand 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.690
 2 + 6 = 8 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.688
 8 + 9 = 17 

00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:02.290
 17 + 5 = 22 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.700
 22 + 2 = 24 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.060
 24 + 2 = 26 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.101
 26 + 5 = 31 

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:14.908
 We put 3 in hand 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.460
 3 + 4 = 7 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.160
 7 + 8 = 15 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.930
 15 + 3 = 18 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.730
 18 + 0 = 18 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.950
 18 + 3 = 21 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.110
 We write 1, we put 2 in hand 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.520
 2 + 2 = 4 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.110
 4 + 5 = 9 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.270
 9 + 4 = 13 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.872
 We write 3, we put 1 in hand 

00:06:35.872 --> 00:06:38.450
 1 + 3 = 4 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.430
 Thus we have achieved the solution 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.570
 It's that easy 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.370
 In addition, there are two advantages here 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.350
 First, we did all the beatings at once 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.090
 And then combinations at the same time 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.370
 The other advantage is that this method is obvious 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.175
 When values ​​solve the problem by traditional method 

00:06:53.175 --> 00:06:54.610
 This will take a lot of space 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.081
 But note, we solved the issue in a smooth and simple way and did not require much space 

00:06:58.081 --> 00:06:59.130
 And we got the answer 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:09.900
 Our answer is 4311973 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.870
 So 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.768
 Now in the next video, you will understand the reason for the success of the method
