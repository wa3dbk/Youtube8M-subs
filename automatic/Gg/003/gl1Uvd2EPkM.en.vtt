my<00:00:08.450> minecraft<00:00:08.660> mod<00:00:09.050> review<00:00:09.350> so<00:00:09.590> this<00:00:09.710> mod<00:00:09.920> is

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
my minecraft mod review so this mod is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.980 
my minecraft mod review so this mod is
the<00:00:10.129> gravity<00:00:10.610> control<00:00:11.120> model<00:00:11.570> this<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:11.960> a

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
the gravity control model this is a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.810 
the gravity control model this is a
really<00:00:12.440> really<00:00:12.650> cool<00:00:12.950> model<00:00:13.280> that<00:00:13.400> allows<00:00:13.670> you

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
really really cool model that allows you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.140 
really really cool model that allows you
to<00:00:14.080> basically<00:00:15.160> control<00:00:16.160> gravity<00:00:16.430> and<00:00:16.910> that<00:00:17.060> is

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
to basically control gravity and that is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.939 
to basically control gravity and that is
really<00:00:17.360> cool<00:00:17.690> so<00:00:18.380> let's<00:00:18.500> get<00:00:18.590> in<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:18.770> crab

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
really cool so let's get in the crab

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.920 
really cool so let's get in the crab
recipes<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.850> first<00:00:20.090> crafting<00:00:20.420> recipe<00:00:20.690> we'll

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
recipes the first crafting recipe we'll

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.509 
recipes the first crafting recipe we'll
be<00:00:21.050> needing<00:00:21.320> to<00:00:21.440> do<00:00:21.560> is<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.009> low<00:00:22.189> gravity

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
be needing to do is the low gravity

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.419 
be needing to do is the low gravity
controller<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:23.869> that<00:00:24.080> is<00:00:24.199> crafted<00:00:24.470> with<00:00:24.859> the

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
controller so that is crafted with the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.029 
controller so that is crafted with the
diamond<00:00:25.789> in<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.970> middle<00:00:26.199> gold<00:00:27.199> surrounded<00:00:27.890> in

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
diamond in the middle gold surrounded in

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.589 
diamond in the middle gold surrounded in
it<00:00:28.279> like<00:00:29.179> that<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:30.249> then<00:00:31.249> four<00:00:31.909> ender<00:00:32.240> pearls

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
it like that and then four ender pearls

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.680 
it like that and then four ender pearls
and<00:00:32.930> that<00:00:33.140> will<00:00:33.320> basically<00:00:33.800> get<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.540> low

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
and that will basically get you the low

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.860 
and that will basically get you the low
gravity<00:00:35.930> controller<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:36.739> to<00:00:37.190> make<00:00:37.340> the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
gravity controller and to make the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.410 
gravity controller and to make the
gravity<00:00:38.870> controller<00:00:39.230> itself<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.850> would<00:00:41.180> be

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
gravity controller itself it would be

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.750 
gravity controller itself it would be
just<00:00:41.990> instead<00:00:42.800> of<00:00:42.860> edit<00:00:43.160> pearls

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
just instead of edit pearls

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.630 
just instead of edit pearls
I<00:00:43.790> have<00:00:44.390> Enders<00:00:44.930> for<00:00:45.380> I<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.890> unders<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.490> that

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
I have Enders for I have unders and that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.140 
I have Enders for I have unders and that
will<00:00:46.760> create<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.900> ground<00:00:48.440> controller<00:00:49.150> and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
will create the ground controller and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.030 
will create the ground controller and
then<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:50.990> will<00:00:51.080> need<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.350> grab<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.680> anchor

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
then we will need to grab the anchor

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.650 
then we will need to grab the anchor
which<00:00:52.460> would<00:00:52.640> be<00:00:52.760> two<00:00:52.940> obsidian<00:00:53.330> like<00:00:53.480> that

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
which would be two obsidian like that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.460 
which would be two obsidian like that
and<00:00:54.110> then<00:00:54.740> three<00:00:55.900> blocks<00:00:56.900> like<00:00:57.080> that<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.380> I'll

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
and then three blocks like that and I'll

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.520 
and then three blocks like that and I'll
give<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:57.740> the<00:00:57.890> gravity<00:00:58.310> anchor<00:00:59.170> okay<00:01:00.170> so

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
give you the gravity anchor okay so

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.250 
give you the gravity anchor okay so
basically<00:01:01.060> the<00:01:02.060> low<00:01:02.390> gravity<00:01:02.660> if<00:01:03.080> you

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
basically the low gravity if you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.859 
basically the low gravity if you
right-click<00:01:03.710> with<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.250> then<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:04.640> whoops<00:01:05.299> if

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
right-click with it then you whoops if

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.749 
right-click with it then you whoops if
you<00:01:06.049> right-click<00:01:06.530> with<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:07.400> get<00:01:07.610> to

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
you right-click with it then you get to

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.800 
you right-click with it then you get to
jump<00:01:08.479> higher<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:10.270> yeah

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
jump higher and yeah

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.950 
jump higher and yeah
so<00:01:12.289> that<00:01:12.740> was<00:01:12.920> just<00:01:12.950> basically<00:01:13.960> jumping

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
so that was just basically jumping

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.050 
so that was just basically jumping
higher<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.679> the<00:01:16.159> best<00:01:16.369> one<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:16.579> the<00:01:16.789> gravity

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
higher and the best one is the gravity

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.690 
higher and the best one is the gravity
controller<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.439> we're<00:01:18.710> basically<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.189> local

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
controller so we're basically the local

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.520 
controller so we're basically the local
gravity<00:01:19.999> controller<00:01:20.329> moving<00:01:21.170> on<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.409> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
gravity controller moving on to the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.730 
gravity controller moving on to the
gravity<00:01:21.920> controller<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.210> basically<00:01:23.649> hold<00:01:24.649> on

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
gravity controller so basically hold on

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.399 
gravity controller so basically hold on
let<00:01:24.859> me<00:01:24.890> spawn<00:01:25.219> a<00:01:25.249> few<00:01:25.579> piggies<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.409> turn

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
let me spawn a few piggies and turn

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.160 
let me spawn a few piggies and turn
little<00:01:27.859> baby<00:01:28.130> off<00:01:28.929> by<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:29.990> way<00:01:30.079> you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
little baby off by the way you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.169 
little baby off by the way you
right-click<00:01:30.409> your<00:01:30.679> honor<00:01:30.829> bezel<00:01:31.249> spawn<00:01:31.909> some

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
right-click your honor bezel spawn some

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.999 
right-click your honor bezel spawn some
pigs<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.960> then<00:01:33.200> when<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.469> right-click<00:01:33.710> at

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
pigs and then when you right-click at

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.249 
pigs and then when you right-click at
the<00:01:34.100> gravity<00:01:34.399> controller<00:01:34.789> it<00:01:35.270> will<00:01:35.479> bring

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
the gravity controller it will bring

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.219 
the gravity controller it will bring
those<00:01:36.649> guys<00:01:36.920> up<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:38.090> reason<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.479> why<00:01:38.810> we

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
those guys up and the reason that why we

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.830 
those guys up and the reason that why we
didn't<00:01:39.499> go<00:01:39.619> up<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:40.579> we<00:01:40.819> have<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.119> anchor

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
didn't go up is because we have a anchor

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
didn't go up is because we have a anchor
on<00:01:41.990> us<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.439> if<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:42.829> throw<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.249> out

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.970 

and<00:01:46.310> get<00:01:46.610> out<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.790> creative<00:01:47.150> oh<00:01:47.210> yes

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.109 

are<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.910> heck

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
are the heck

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.580 
are the heck
if<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:54.000> sponsor<00:01:55.000> pigs<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.109> we<00:01:56.200> know<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.530> our

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
if we sponsor pigs so we know that our

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.910 
if we sponsor pigs so we know that our
guards

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.399 

whoops<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:01.280> think<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.490> right-click<00:02:01.729> too<00:02:02.090> much

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
whoops I think I right-click too much

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.760 
whoops I think I right-click too much
response<00:02:03.409> more<00:02:03.800> pigs<00:02:04.159> oh<00:02:05.110> it's<00:02:06.110> already<00:02:06.290> on<00:02:06.500> so

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
response more pigs oh it's already on so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.110 
response more pigs oh it's already on so
throw<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.220> out<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.729> oh<00:02:09.580> yeah<00:02:10.580> well<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:10.970> think

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
throw it out and oh yeah well I think

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.540 
throw it out and oh yeah well I think
yeah<00:02:11.630> there<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.170> go<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.800> now<00:02:12.830> we're<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.370> up

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
yeah there we go so now we're going up

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.340 
yeah there we go so now we're going up
really<00:02:14.030> really<00:02:14.240> high<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.020> got<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.230> make

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
really really high and you got to make
