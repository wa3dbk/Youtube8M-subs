00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.920

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.990

 Zhuravlev 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.969
 before this object seen only with 

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:28.059
 of air, but fate brought him 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.710
 the day before to make an emergency landing square 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.599
 flying brest in what 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 happened 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.480
 technical malfunction with 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 engine 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.360
 Minsk was still quite far away 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.060
 and the situation developed 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.670
 pretty fast 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.150
 by absolutely dispatchers about 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 who said that port brest n 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.300
 we made a decision 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 on the news system 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.020
 private jet business aviation 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.559
 made the flight to change to Moscow 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.339
 there were only three crew members on board 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.969
 the shipâ€™s air was already near 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670
 two hours in the Russian capital 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.229
 there was no more than one and a half hours of flight 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560
 when the plane vibration began 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.280
 engine 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 then the rhetorical system failed 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 and ahead the road was blocked by a thunderstorm 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.010
 front 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.930
 the plane followed 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 at an altitude of 12 thousand tons 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.460
 and who is 450 solved 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.370
 this is extreme reduction 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.860
 fast enough 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.980
 All our peoples rubles at the rate of 12 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.720
 thousand tons practically should 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.590
 circled found a contest 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.780
 given the emergency situation in greece a 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.210
 pore 11 units were sent 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.450
 rescue equipment 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.009
 but often since rescuers not 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.630
 needed a plane produced 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.439
 no good landing 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.729
 people or equipment did not suffer in this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.429

 places will come commission which 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.899
 will determine the fault certificate 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.290
 was repaired 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.620
 in the future, the aircraft will take off on 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.670
 purpose according to the investigation 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.729
 the vessel is a Russian citizen 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.659
