00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.770
 today at bar college we're going to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.050
 give tips so you can calculate how much 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.050
 meat buy in your next roast beef 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.670
 tip number 1 a person on average will 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.530
 eat between 250 and 300 grams of meat that 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.720
 it means that if you have guests that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.340
 eat like a decent person more or 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.360
 minus one kilo of meat is going to give you 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.489
 for 4 tip number 2 if you're going to do 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.949
 burgers hamburgers carry 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.250
 less meat a medium hamburger has 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.620
 more or less between 120 and 150 grams and a 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 generous hamburger or as I say 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.590
 a hamburger to see if they have 350 and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.930
 180 grams you also have to consider 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.460
 that not everyone eats just one 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.729
 hamburger 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.500
 number 3 remember that not only are you going to 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.049
 bring meat that you can fill your 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.409
 guests with other things like guacamole 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:25.090
 beans tortillas tortilla chips 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.149
 palm is cheese and many more things 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.750
 suppose that surprise guests arrive 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.640
 and you are going to require number 4 from us 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.240
 we recommend you chop the meat and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.729
 serve it in tacos so that it yields more 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.250
 last but not least the tip 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.530
 number 5 buy your meat in the bouquets 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 These were our 5 tips for 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.800

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.800
