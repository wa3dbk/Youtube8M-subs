 something very important so nothing we are going to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.120

 description to download this program 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.350
 called explorer once they download it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.059
 they are going to do them simply double click not 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 not only do many good videos here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 double believes that execute but it makes me 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 very strange to make videos in the well in the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.879
 desk but good now let's 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.469

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.650
 bit complicated and good we're going to give it 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.150

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.310
 desktop icon was great if not no 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.700
 start installing the program and then 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.140
 here we are simply going to finish and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690

 iexplorer ok now to enter a map 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.110
 it is very simple that is that it is a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.910
 Free version but do not worry 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.650

 they do is connect the devices in 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.540
