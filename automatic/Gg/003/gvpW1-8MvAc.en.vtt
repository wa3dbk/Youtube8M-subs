00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
all this movement one line of technique

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.630 
all this movement one line of technique
you<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.560> start<00:04:43.860> them<00:04:44.040> up<00:04:44.130> it's<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
you can start them up it's like the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.720 
you can start them up it's like the
let's<00:04:45.120> top<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:46.080> can<00:04:46.230> start<00:04:46.470> them<00:04:46.620> up<00:04:46.770> with<00:04:46.950> gun

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
let's top you can start them up with gun

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.640 
let's top you can start them up with gun
and<00:04:48.030> then<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.510> come<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.690> jab<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.350> instance

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
and then you come and jab for instance

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.500 
and then you come and jab for instance
or<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.280> can<00:04:50.430> start<00:04:50.610> with<00:04:50.670> gun<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.210> then<00:04:51.360> hit

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
or you can start with gun and then hit

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.800 
or you can start with gun and then hit
is<00:04:51.660> I<00:04:51.780> gun<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.940> come<00:04:53.940> back<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.150> pack

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
is I gun and then you come back to pack

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.750 
is I gun and then you come back to pack
and<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.380> can<00:04:55.560> lower<00:04:55.770> heat<00:04:56.040> for<00:04:56.220> instance<00:04:56.520> yeah

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
and you can lower heat for instance yeah

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
back to fook for instant compound until

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.250 
back to fook for instant compound until
chat<00:05:02.010> him<00:05:02.160> okay<00:05:02.790> so<00:05:03.180> sometime<00:05:03.540> we<00:05:03.660> could<00:05:03.780> go

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
chat him okay so sometime we could go

chat him okay so sometime we could go
turn<00:05:04.590> him<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:05.010> then<00:05:05.280> gun<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.730> then<00:05:05.880> again

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
turn him and then gun and then again

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.510 
turn him and then gun and then again
they<00:05:06.510> come<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.870> attack<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:07.770> each<00:05:07.980> one<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.400> that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
they come to attack so each one of that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.370 
they come to attack so each one of that
is<00:05:08.760> up<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.330> how<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.630> use<00:05:09.840> I'll<00:05:10.020> get<00:05:10.170> for<00:05:10.290> you

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
is up to you how to use I'll get for you

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.690 
is up to you how to use I'll get for you
that's<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.010> idea

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
that's the idea

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.260 
that's the idea
oven<00:05:12.480> it's<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.260> length<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:14.100> cancer<00:05:14.640> it's

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
oven it's a length of the cancer it's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.130 
oven it's a length of the cancer it's
got<00:05:15.450> more<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:16.170> than<00:05:16.290> that<00:05:16.350> because<00:05:18.140> can

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
got more to it than that because can

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.710 
got more to it than that because can
sound<00:05:19.440> can<00:05:19.620> be<00:05:19.650> very<00:05:19.980> useful<00:05:20.610> but<00:05:21.360> because

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
sound can be very useful but because

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.620 
sound can be very useful but because
food<00:05:22.230> is<00:05:22.440> TV<00:05:23.130> difficult<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:23.910> explain<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.540> you

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
food is TV difficult to explain to you

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.410 
food is TV difficult to explain to you
