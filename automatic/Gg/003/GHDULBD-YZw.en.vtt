00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.570
 all are sitting with you and how are you 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.570
 understand today it will go from this 10 la 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.030
 la American branch of T110 e5 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.700
 once when led this tank was himself 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.350
 bend over 7 punishing tank 10 worried 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.050
 but the times please go 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.170
 introduced new tanks and of course all 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.879
 changed some say that tank 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.430
 stopped bending lost his 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.110
 relevance with the introduction of new drum 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.239
 tanks and pt 10 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.460
 but I will try to prove you back and 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.129
 I think that this tank is still the most 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.229
 actual current realities it possesses 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.180
 fairly average characteristics 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.280
 for a heavy tank, let's say the same 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.440
 speed maximum speed 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.479
 this tank is 37 kilometers in 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.420
 an hour which is good enough of course not 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.180
 as good as Denis 7 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.159
 but still it's fast enough 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.810
 take a comfortable position and catch your 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.460
 adversary by surprise 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 also the tank has good maneuverability 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.350
 highway speed of 30 degrees per second is 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.369
 certainly not the best result but 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.790
 same principle 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.890
 averaged waiting for this 10 la la also 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.320
 I would like to note the good armor of this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.720
 tank but this is only in frontal projection 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.150
 and on the sides and in Kamensk armor 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.990
 bad enough and of course it remains 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.210
 want better but of course weak 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.130
 places of the tank is the game the very thing 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.680
 weak point is the turret of the commander 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.570
 which is just tremendous making its way to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.820
 tanks even 7 left 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.990
 also in this tank is very good 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.450
 gun steel fund average damage 400 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.930
 no penetration is almost 260 square meters so agree 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 360 current realities and new pt 10 not 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.599
 so much but still it is enough 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.690
 plus note this gun puts 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.360
 just 2 seconds almost as in 110 l and this 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.700
 much 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.410
 pleases the eye also the gun has a very 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.450
 a good six rate of fire 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.160
 shots per minute this is very very 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 good results and let's 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.870
 let's see in practice what can this 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.080
 car in the current update bends 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.220
 whether or not she can only judge you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.990
 now we are watching the fight 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.020
 this fight that I would like to show you 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.850
 On the map where is the fishing bay ? 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.850
 curtain for yourself the amount of damage on 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.520
 By the way, by the way, I am auto Peter 1 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.260
 tenth or being in a tampa is like 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.959
 I would say so not surprisingly ride 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.150
 by the way with Coca Cola why so shark there 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.310
 instead of 2 modeling from a fire extinguisher because 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.430
 that the tank burns very very rarely and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.950
 so the cabbage I still repair perk 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.070
 repair which principle would not row 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.780
 Putin, but if you need to get away quickly from 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.330
 rinks then of course you can use 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.850
 same frame and coca-cola on also 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.130
 accelerates recharging accelerating also 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.230
 information and principle all characteristics 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.799
 given crew by ten percent too 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.049
 not bad and that's the principle 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.000
 very standard position on this map 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.590
 but for some reason many people forget about it 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.230
 being with this arrest 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.780
 All the more for such a chalk center gift 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.430
 not busy 1 just art and me here 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.680
 principle nobody can highlight well 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.959
 Of course, if I come myself, they won't come out 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.880
 There are these double bushes for which I can 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.640
 just adjust by your opponents 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.010
 who are standing around the corner breaking down a house 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.750
 Of course so that it does not interfere and, in principle, I 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.769
 could normally throw while you 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.900
 fourth until vika and 110 but of course 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.799
 here it is necessary not to flirt that yourself 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.750
 I will flirt 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.489
 they can also break this house too 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.320
 can drink a kavik and distribute not 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.860
 who knows if the drum will go all 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.860
 punch and maybe not maybe not 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.860
 lucky 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.240
 and of course I forgot to remind more about 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.599
 one thing 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.940
 not a significant minus which principle he 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.770
 affects here such protracted battles as 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.569
 Now when a lot of hits 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.090
 non-penetration it is of course quite 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.860
 small ammunition and 5 due to the fact 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.569
 that recharging is not fast enough and 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.699
 principle in the kit goes 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.349
 fast enough too if of course 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.449
 you will not break through there as data 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.759
 situations i used up shells just 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.860
 right and left then of course not known 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.860
 the end of the battle enough for you or not 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.650
 and as you can see the allies are already full 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.009
 This stayed almost alone 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.620
 Of course, there are still allied IS 7 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:10.439
 Well, that principle is the use of it is not 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.930
 so much and will not be and of course 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:15.569
 if but from him is also quite so 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.889
 I did not see a significant effect here 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.870
 begins to capture the base and of course 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.759
 starts to stray from 3 who tried 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.280
 run away but I still beat off as a result 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.139
 the projectile remains very little very 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.990
 few and of course yes they spend sums 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.509
 but I'm already beginning to understand that the beginning of the battle 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.219
 made the biggest mistake this is just 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.960
 wasted so much projectile 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.610
 what was so very very much damage 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.150
 and it remains to look vanshotom 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.430
 four 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.009
 I strive for the first time gold caterpillar 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.529
 the second time I do not break through oh it was like not 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:46.050
 sorry I'd rather be passionate and she is a land minder 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.180
 and would kill her but hardly try and there 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.120
 the turret can be everything just 20 km 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.029
 from akvalita 20 on him a mine and what 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.969
 the festival is just 54 cap and effort and and 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:59.370
 Allied art kill butcher and I get 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.449
 all the same lucky here 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.060
 got a fight 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.610
 sorry that I was killed of course I introduced 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.529
 a record amount of damage well 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.930
 Well look at the results of the battle 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:17.159
 but how to go on the results of the fight how much 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.810
 got defeated 1744 experience and 142,000 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:22.289
 silver is also a medal of war and 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.180
 lucky and also brought 9 thousand damage and 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.669
 Now let's see what made our 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.039
 teams team as you can see nifiga not 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:31.379
 did again they don't know gone 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.599
 somewhere or something tried some 5 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:36.719
 new some tactics to work I already 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.969
 I paid and they do not understand these allies 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:41.279
 see 9 still racing and in second place 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:43.830
 there somewhere about two and a half thousand inflicted 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:46.860
 player 2 on damage potential damage 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.289
 received almost 5,000 battle principle 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.120
 It was a success and we are waiting for new videos of course with 

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:51.660
 victories already results I have 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.830
 no longer 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.480
