00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.670 

right<00:02:00.980> so<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:01.580> was<00:02:01.730> a<00:02:01.760> lot<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.680> drivers

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
right so there was a lot of drivers

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.250 
right so there was a lot of drivers
missing<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.850> had<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.150> painstakingly<00:02:05.390> go

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
missing and I had to painstakingly go

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.350 
missing and I had to painstakingly go
through<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.770> windows<00:02:07.159> support<00:02:07.550> files<00:02:07.850> here

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
through the windows support files here

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.880 
through the windows support files here
and<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:09.500> boot<00:02:09.890> camp<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:11.230> under<00:02:12.230> drivers

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and in boot camp and under drivers

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.310 
and in boot camp and under drivers
apparently<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> programs<00:02:14.390> when<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.110> try<00:02:15.290> to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
apparently the programs when you try to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.710 
apparently the programs when you try to
run<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.890> boot<00:02:16.340> camp<00:02:16.580> software<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.600> you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
run the boot camp software like you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.630 
run the boot camp software like you
would<00:02:17.840> normally<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.620> setup<00:02:18.950> program<00:02:19.220> here

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
would normally do the setup program here

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.270 
would normally do the setup program here
it<00:02:20.060> didn't<00:02:20.450> want<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.660> work<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.920> had<00:02:22.160> to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
it didn't want to work so I had to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.310 
it didn't want to work so I had to
painstakingly<00:02:22.490> go<00:02:23.060> through<00:02:23.600> each<00:02:23.930> one<00:02:23.990> of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
painstakingly go through each one of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.530 
painstakingly go through each one of
these<00:02:24.500> drivers<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.070> 64-bit<00:02:25.940> version<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
these drivers a 64-bit version and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.110 
these drivers a 64-bit version and
install<00:02:26.930> all<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.560> these<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:28.160> don't<00:02:28.760> even<00:02:28.850> know

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
install all of these I don't even know

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.820 
install all of these I don't even know
what<00:02:29.450> most<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.620> them<00:02:30.740> are<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:33.380> just

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
what most of them are and I just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.350 
what most of them are and I just
installed<00:02:34.250> every<00:02:34.580> single<00:02:34.910> one<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.120> them

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
installed every single one of them

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.020 
installed every single one of them
anyways<00:02:35.989> when<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:36.980> did<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.580> got<00:02:37.610> everything

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
anyways when I did that I got everything

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.350 
anyways when I did that I got everything

and the trackpad is working at first it
was<00:02:56.150> working<00:02:56.450> kind<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.720> weird<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
was working kind of weird the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.490 
was working kind of weird the
sensitivity<00:02:59.390> on<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.720> was<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> little<00:03:00.230> strange

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
sensitivity on it was a little strange

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.890 
sensitivity on it was a little strange
but<00:03:00.890> now<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.430> seems<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.820> be<00:03:01.970> working<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.390> fine

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
but now it seems to be working just fine

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.259 
but now it seems to be working just fine
and<00:03:03.880> what<00:03:04.880> else

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
and what else

and what else
umm<00:03:06.760> yeah<00:03:07.760> everything<00:03:08.239> just<00:03:08.480> seems<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.080> be

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
umm yeah everything just seems to be

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.009 
umm yeah everything just seems to be
working<00:03:09.530> ok<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.570> this<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.750> pretty

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
working ok and this is pretty

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.180 
working ok and this is pretty
interesting<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.620> me

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
interesting to me

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.130 
interesting to me
because<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.940> always<00:03:14.120> thought<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.540> had<00:03:14.570> had<00:03:14.870> Mac

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
because I always thought you had had Mac

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.620 
because I always thought you had had Mac
OS<00:03:15.410> X<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.799> there<00:03:15.980> now<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.760> hard<00:03:16.970> drive<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.209> here

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
OS X on there now the hard drive on here

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.949 
OS X on there now the hard drive on here
is<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:18.880> formatted<00:03:19.880> as<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> Master<00:03:20.600> Boot<00:03:20.780> Record

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
is a formatted as a Master Boot Record

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.490 
is a formatted as a Master Boot Record
partition<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.920> not<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.790> GUI<00:03:23.329> D<00:03:23.510> partition

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
partition and not the GUI D partition

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.530 
partition and not the GUI D partition
like<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.769> would<00:03:24.920> normally<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.340> on<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.549> Mac<00:03:25.820> so

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
like you would normally get on a Mac so

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.750 
like you would normally get on a Mac so
it<00:03:26.930> boots<00:03:27.200> Master<00:03:27.709> Boot<00:03:27.860> Record<00:03:28.070> hard<00:03:28.489> drives

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
it boots Master Boot Record hard drives

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.039 
it boots Master Boot Record hard drives
just<00:03:29.090> fine<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:31.130> don't<00:03:32.030> know<00:03:32.360> if<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.989> can

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
just fine and I don't know if I can

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.640 
just fine and I don't know if I can
install<00:03:33.890> Windows<00:03:34.549> 8<00:03:34.959> traditionally<00:03:35.959> like<00:03:36.530> you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
install Windows 8 traditionally like you

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.080 
install Windows 8 traditionally like you
normally<00:03:36.829> would<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.340> just<00:03:37.459> pop<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:37.880> in

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
normally would like just pop this in

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.449 
normally would like just pop this in
hold<00:03:38.480> C<00:03:38.780> down<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.709> will<00:03:39.860> actually<00:03:40.280> boot

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
hold C down and if it will actually boot

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.880 
hold C down and if it will actually boot
up<00:03:40.640> that's<00:03:41.209> probably<00:03:41.660> going<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.900> be<00:03:42.019> my<00:03:42.290> next

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
up that's probably going to be my next

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.460 
up that's probably going to be my next
venture<00:03:43.100> or<00:03:43.760> for<00:03:44.239> any<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.900> out<00:03:45.049> there<00:03:45.079> want

venture or for any of you out there want
to<00:03:45.560> actually<00:03:45.650> try<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.720> don't

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
to actually try that and you don't

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.539 
to actually try that and you don't
really<00:03:48.170> care<00:03:48.290> about<00:03:48.500> your<00:03:48.860> mac<00:03:49.100> OS<00:03:49.370> x
