00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hey guys here's a little bit of proof of

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.460 
hey guys here's a little bit of proof of
the<00:00:02.730> Serie<00:00:03.149> proxies<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.780> got<00:00:03.959> going<00:00:04.230> on

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
the Serie proxies that I got going on

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.200 
the Serie proxies that I got going on
it's<00:00:05.400> using<00:00:05.790> spire<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:07.099> proxy<00:00:08.099> server<00:00:08.210> that

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
it's using spire and a proxy server that

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.110 
it's using spire and a proxy server that
I'm<00:00:09.300> hosting<00:00:09.480> right<00:00:09.990> now<00:00:10.639> to<00:00:11.639> prove<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.880> this

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
