00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
computer but anyways I thought it would

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
computer but anyways I thought it would
be<00:00:37.500> boring<00:00:37.890> until<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.850> looked<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
be boring until but when I looked at the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
be boring until but when I looked at the
RAM<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> woke<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.410> said<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> takes<00:00:41.309> two

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
RAM it woke up it said that it takes two

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.250

bigger<00:00:41.879> lights<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> thought<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> myself

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bigger lights so I thought to myself

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
bigger lights so I thought to myself
that<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.040> game<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.940> exciting<00:00:45.420> because

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
