00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.360
 Apple does not just have the iphone 6 today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.480
 and the iphone 6 space presented 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 but also the apple website 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.759
 still call itself a watch that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.289
 just because it is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.820
 somehow naturalized and has it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.560
 I also personally wondered that one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 then did not take the name because 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 somehow is a pretty nice one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 name what the clock can do 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 A whole lot of apple has become many 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.230
 thought and tried it 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.820
 Of course to do better than that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.859
 manufacturers who are already on the market 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.540
 The US is really pretty chic 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.250
 is well done offers a lot 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 options that is, there are three 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 versions of the ur speak of the housing 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
 then there are six different ones 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 bracelets that you can combine with it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 the whole thing works over such a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.210
 click procedure that is totally fast 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 and just that somehow then 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 replaces the bracelet and at the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 stainless steel users then too 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.039
 make smaller or larger accordingly 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.780
 can 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.010
 that other watch manufacturers have up to that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 not understood today although we still 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.899
 time was what the software is it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 really succeeded there too has apple 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.129
 thought is nice that that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.900
 Touchscreen really responded well though 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 Not every gesture works because of it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.770
 even at his watch just no sense 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 that's what the digital crown is for 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 thought to be right on the side of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 eu is thus one looks for example 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.450
 or go through any list 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.400
 or you can do that too 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.900
 with scrolling is definitely on 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 this entire berlin concept really 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.619
 very nice which functions themselves 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 but still have to prove that are 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.520
 the whole social functions because 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.930
 Of course I can take any pictures 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.909
 send or something but now completely 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.770
 honestly who uses that will be seen 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.270
 Maybe in a year is completely gang 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 and would give that on flirt paradise with 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.570
 The coach I found personally 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 It's a bit strange now 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.939
 but good that the clock comes first 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.040
 2015 is promised it comes early 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.030
 2015 but I think then you have to 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.880
 wait half a year 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 From the price, the clock starts at 350 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 dollar and then goes up 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 probably the edition is then the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 most expensive because that is in 18k gold 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.970
 and probably already 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.070
 from the material much more expensive 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.050
 What else is left to say the award is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.670
 a nice thing also has sensors for 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.380
 fitness and so can be versatile 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 of course, there is one 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.880
 sdk for developers and one may also 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.250
 do not forget to work wonderfully with 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.780
 the iphone together that one needs 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.730
 even for the irish so it is not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 car clock just works that way 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.630
 but you need an iphone for it 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
 but on iphone 5 you have to 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.550
 not necessarily the new ones 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.260
 grab devices 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.520
 We will see from next year 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.620
 then available and then at 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.060
 us in the test and how they are then 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.060
 beats that on computerbild.de
