00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.199
 furniture corners everything everything everything everything from 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.840
 all the sofa furniture from all of it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.029
 bites all the time and he twice more 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 to hurt it bites asks all 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.149
 people that come into my house and have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.989
 people who stop coming here because of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.750
 his 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.480
 well I hope this helps the dogs a lot 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 How do you like to be biting the way? 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 which naturally interact with the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.910
 people 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.270
 we need to show them who have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.219
 another way cooler way that is not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 biting us but for the dogs 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.559
 who are most anxious when they bite 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.840
 they also relax so cool to leave 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.579
 they bite it does not have to be us 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 but it can be an object 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 I have here for example is a one 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 rubber toy and when the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 Northeastern toy box 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.890
 rubber for example I can give 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900
 enough attention for her she goes 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.450
 find out if she bites the toy 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
 I give more attention to her than 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770
 when she bit my hand 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.689
 If she does not want to bite I can 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 put some food inside I go 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.880
 showing her that she wins the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.770
 Careful care and the cool thing is that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 when the dog is with a toy 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 in his mouth he can not bite us 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.310
 also can not bite the furniture 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.650
 furniture corners 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.960
 so instead of giving food to the laf 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.119
 his reason pot places inside 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.909
 toys so that it spends much more 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.820
 time getting his food is 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.149
 healthier and will protect your 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.149
 furniture 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.930
