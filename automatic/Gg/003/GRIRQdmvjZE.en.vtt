00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.089 
two in a minute too as for the the items
that<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.990> wear<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.679> doesn't

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that you wear it it really doesn't

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.850 
that you wear it it really doesn't
matter<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> now<00:00:33.680> playing<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
matter it's up to you now playing as the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.740 
matter it's up to you now playing as the
pyro<00:00:35.190> everybody<00:00:35.790> knows<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> turn<00:00:36.630> up

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
pyro everybody knows you want to turn up

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.450 
pyro everybody knows you want to turn up
your<00:00:36.840> sensitive<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> ridiculously<00:00:38.219> high

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
your sensitive to a ridiculously high

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.420 
your sensitive to a ridiculously high
level<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.989> did<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.950> we're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
level so we just did that and now we're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
level so we just did that and now we're
more<00:00:41.760> uncontrollably<00:00:42.570> moving<00:00:43.230> our<00:00:43.410> head

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
more uncontrollably moving our head

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.150 
more uncontrollably moving our head
around<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.059> basis<00:00:45.590> basic<00:00:46.590> strategy<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
around so the basis basic strategy is to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
around so the basis basic strategy is to
get<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.059> middle<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> map<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> Center

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
get to the middle of the map to Center

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
get to the middle of the map to Center
well<00:00:49.230> everything's<00:00:49.770> exploding<00:00:50.219> around<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
well everything's exploding around you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
well everything's exploding around you
and<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.090> start<00:00:51.449> spinning<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> madman

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and just start spinning like a madman

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
and just start spinning like a madman
like<00:00:53.340> burning<00:00:54.180> everything<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.809> just

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
like burning everything you know just

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
like burning everything you know just
just<00:00:55.469> shooting<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.010> spinning<00:00:56.340> around<00:00:56.430> as

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just shooting and spinning around as

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.369 
just shooting and spinning around as
