training<00:03:26.390> 5<00:03:26.690> or<00:03:26.870> 6<00:03:27.019> hours<00:03:27.139> straight<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.090> you

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
training 5 or 6 hours straight and you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.000 
training 5 or 6 hours straight and you
see<00:03:29.389> them<00:03:29.600> doing<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.380> stomp<00:03:30.709> they<00:03:30.950> do

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
see them doing that the stomp they do

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.920 
see them doing that the stomp they do
that<00:03:31.250> maybe<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.760> couple<00:03:32.000> hundred<00:03:32.180> times<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.870> a

an enormous appetite and they're gonna

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.490 
an enormous appetite and they're gonna
