now<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:16.030> LEDs<00:02:16.450> you're<00:02:16.600> going<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.870> for

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
now the LEDs you're going to have for

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.690 
now the LEDs you're going to have for
across<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.590> front<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.070> you're<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:18.520> going

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
across the front and you're also going

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.310 
across the front and you're also going
to<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.330> LED<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.840> points<00:02:20.170> out<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
to have this one LED that points out to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.560 
to have this one LED that points out to
the<00:02:20.440> side<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.460> nice<00:02:21.700> thing<00:02:22.030> about<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.360> is

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the side the nice thing about this is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.180 
the side the nice thing about this is
LEDs<00:02:22.960> are<00:02:23.110> super<00:02:23.440> bright<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:23.920> they're<00:02:24.010> also

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
LEDs are super bright but they're also

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.640 
LEDs are super bright but they're also
super<00:02:24.730> directional<00:02:25.570> so<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:26.260> one<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
super directional so this one that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.410 
super directional so this one that
points<00:02:26.980> out<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> side<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.360> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
points out to the side is going to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.150 
points out to the side is going to
really<00:02:28.780> signal<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> drivers<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:29.980> are<00:02:30.070> on

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
really signal the drivers that are on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160 
really signal the drivers that are on
your<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:30.490> or<00:02:30.520> your<00:02:30.670> left<00:02:30.790> hey<00:02:31.420> I'm<00:02:31.690> coming

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.110 
your right or your left hey I'm coming
over<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.070> want<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.340> light<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.090> I

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
over and I want to light this up so I

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.580 
over and I want to light this up so I
can<00:02:34.300> show<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.540> exactly<00:02:34.900> what<00:02:35.170> I'm<00:02:35.230> talking

can show you exactly what I'm talking
about

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
about

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.520 
about
so<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.940> pre-wired<00:02:37.420> down<00:02:37.690> below<00:02:37.960> so

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
so I have this pre-wired down below so

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.900 
so I have this pre-wired down below so
we're<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.800> click<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.640> stays

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
we're going to click this on so it stays

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.090 
we're going to click this on so it stays
lit<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.270> continuous<00:02:40.750> use<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:41.650> you'll<00:02:41.830> notice

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
lit in continuous use now you'll notice

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.760 
lit in continuous use now you'll notice
we've<00:02:42.520> got<00:02:42.670> four<00:02:43.150> set<00:02:43.780> LEDs<00:02:44.260> going<00:02:44.560> straight

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
we've got four set LEDs going straight

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.260 
we've got four set LEDs going straight
out<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> front<00:02:45.220> you'll<00:02:45.370> see<00:02:45.430> how<00:02:45.820> bright

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
out to the front you'll see how bright

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.820 
out to the front you'll see how bright
that<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.540> especially<00:02:46.930> when<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.440> compare<00:02:47.800> it

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
that is especially when you compare it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.490 
that is especially when you compare it
to<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:48.010> regular<00:02:48.220> incandescent<00:02:48.700> bulb<00:02:49.320> where<00:02:50.320> the

I'm coming over and you'll also notice
the<00:03:04.660> arrow<00:03:04.900> gets<00:03:05.140> its<00:03:05.290> name<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.160> actually<00:03:06.820> let

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the arrow gets its name and actually let

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.220 
the arrow gets its name and actually let
me<00:03:06.940> turn<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.209> off<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:07.540> I'm<00:03:07.630> not<00:03:07.780> blinding<00:03:08.170> you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
me turn this off so I'm not blinding you

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.060 
me turn this off so I'm not blinding you
can<00:03:08.350> actually<00:03:08.590> see<00:03:08.680> what<00:03:08.770> I'm<00:03:08.830> talking<00:03:09.040> about

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
can actually see what I'm talking about

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.710 
can actually see what I'm talking about
the<00:03:09.640> arrow<00:03:09.790> gets<00:03:09.970> its<00:03:10.180> name<00:03:10.300> from<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.540> fact

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the arrow gets its name from the fact

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.390 
the arrow gets its name from the fact
that<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:11.050> shaped<00:03:11.350> almost<00:03:11.620> with<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.160> nice

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
these on my bike personally so one thing

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.140 
these on my bike personally so one thing
to<00:03:29.769> keep<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.070> mind<00:03:30.130> when<00:03:30.580> you're<00:03:30.730> considering

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
to keep in mind when you're considering

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.660 
to keep in mind when you're considering
going<00:03:31.510> over<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.080> an<00:03:32.200> LED<00:03:32.440> setup<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.250> that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
going over to an LED setup is that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.890 
going over to an LED setup is that
you're<00:03:33.790> going<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:33.940> need<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.300> add<00:03:34.450> in<00:03:34.810> a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
you're going to need to add in a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.120 
you're going to need to add in a
resistor<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.440> that's<00:03:35.590> going<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.800> take<00:03:35.980> us

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
resistor and that's going to take us

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.430 
resistor and that's going to take us
right<00:03:36.160> into<00:03:36.430> our<00:03:36.700> installation<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:38.019> we<00:03:38.170> talked

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
right into our installation so we talked

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.930 
right into our installation so we talked
about<00:03:38.560> install<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.160> beginning<00:03:39.489> install

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
about install in the beginning install

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.640 
about install in the beginning install
is<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.390> one<00:03:40.870> out<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.019> three<00:03:41.110> our

BSP or beard scale difficulty for

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.509 
BSP or beard scale difficulty for
installation<00:03:44.070> even<00:03:45.070> when<00:03:45.400> you're

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
installation even when you're

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.160 
installation even when you're
considering<00:03:46.060> going<00:03:46.180> over<00:03:46.510> an<00:03:46.600> LED<00:03:46.989> system

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
considering going over an LED system

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.610 
considering going over an LED system
it's<00:03:47.470> still<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.830> simple<00:03:48.130> lift<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.410> anytime<00:03:50.410> you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
it's still a simple lift so anytime you

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.320 
it's still a simple lift so anytime you
have<00:03:50.739> an<00:03:50.890> LED<00:03:51.160> light<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.880> less

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
have an LED light you have less

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.390 
have an LED light you have less
resistance<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.110> less<00:03:53.230> draw<00:03:53.620> off<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.250> your

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
resistance and less draw off of your

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.430 
resistance and less draw off of your
electrical<00:03:54.850> system<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.690> need<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.959> add<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.350> a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.680 
electrical system you need to add in a
resistor<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.549> your<00:03:57.700> flasher<00:03:58.269> doesn't<00:03:58.570> make

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
resistor so your flasher doesn't make

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.620 
resistor so your flasher doesn't make
the<00:03:58.840> bulb<00:03:59.110> flash<00:03:59.620> extremely<00:04:00.190> fast<00:04:00.489> orangy<00:04:01.480> has

the bulb flash extremely fast orangy has

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.390 
the bulb flash extremely fast orangy has
got<00:04:01.810> specific<00:04:02.110> resistors<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.100> just<00:04:03.280> add

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
got specific resistors and you just add

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.160 
got specific resistors and you just add
in<00:04:03.820> line<00:04:04.090> using<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.630> existing<00:04:04.810> butt
