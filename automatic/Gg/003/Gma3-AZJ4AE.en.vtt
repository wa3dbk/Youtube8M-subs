quarter<00:00:02.760> notes<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.140> far<00:00:04.350> we've<00:00:04.529> learned

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
quarter notes and so far we've learned

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.249 
quarter notes and so far we've learned
quarter<00:00:05.279> notes<00:00:05.460> half<00:00:05.759> notes<00:00:06.240> eighth<00:00:07.230> notes

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
quarter notes half notes eighth notes

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.520 
quarter notes half notes eighth notes
and<00:00:08.210> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> be<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> new<00:00:09.870> concept<00:00:10.139> on

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and this is going to be a new concept on

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.419 
and this is going to be a new concept on
top<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:12.170> in<00:00:13.170> music<00:00:13.380> bad<00:00:13.830> corn<00:00:14.250> else

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
top of that and in music bad corn else

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.310 
top of that and in music bad corn else
look<00:00:14.700> like<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.059> quarter<00:00:15.480> note<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.260> dot

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
look like a quarter note with a dot

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.070 
look like a quarter note with a dot
after<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.869> then<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.960> my

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
after just like this and then in my

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.400 
after just like this and then in my
notation<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.060> letter<00:00:21.410> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
notation it's going to be the letter the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
notation it's going to be the letter the
string<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> dash<00:00:23.789> after<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> data

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
string with a dash after that's the data

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.140 
string with a dash after that's the data
quarter<00:00:25.170> note<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.560> then<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.400> quotations<00:00:27.000> is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
quarter note and then the quotations is

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.980 
quarter note and then the quotations is
going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> signify<00:00:27.810> an<00:00:28.170> eighth<00:00:28.320> note<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
going to signify an eighth note so and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.420 
going to signify an eighth note so and
technically<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> dotted<00:00:31.470> quarter<00:00:31.800> note<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.070> one

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
technically a dotted quarter note is one

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.940 
technically a dotted quarter note is one
and<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> half<00:00:32.790> beats<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:34.380> you're<00:00:34.829> probably

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and a half beats now you're probably

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.440 
and a half beats now you're probably
wondering<00:00:35.370> how<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.640> count<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> half

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
wondering how do I count one and a half

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
wondering how do I count one and a half
beats<00:00:36.660> well<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.160> have

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
beats well to do that you actually have

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.319 
beats well to do that you actually have
to<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.590> eighth<00:00:40.590> notes<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:42.239> an

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to think in eighth notes so to think an

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.639 
to think in eighth notes so to think an
eighth<00:00:42.480> notes<00:00:42.690> yep<00:00:42.960> you're<00:00:43.140> thinking<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
eighth notes yep you're thinking that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.090 
eighth notes yep you're thinking that
each<00:00:43.920> beats<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.670> each<00:00:44.789> account<00:00:45.210> click<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:46.100> 0.5

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
each beats or each account click is 0.5

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.729 
each beats or each account click is 0.5
so<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> eighth<00:00:48.329> notes<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.960> dotted

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
so if you think in eighth notes a dotted

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
so if you think in eighth notes a dotted
quarter<00:00:50.010> note<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.820> three<00:00:51.449> clicks

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
quarter note is going to be three clicks

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.119 
quarter note is going to be three clicks
or<00:00:52.110> three<00:00:52.320> counts<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.329> example<00:00:54.480> here

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
or three counts so in this example here

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.380 
or three counts so in this example here
if<00:00:56.129> you're<00:00:56.250> thinking<00:00:56.579> eighth<00:00:56.730> notes<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.210> have

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
if you're thinking eighth notes you have

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
if you're thinking eighth notes you have
three<00:00:57.840> clicks<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> data<00:00:58.739> quarter<00:00:59.190> note

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
three clicks for the data quarter note

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490 
three clicks for the data quarter note
and<00:00:59.579> then<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.600> click<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> eighth<00:01:01.289> note

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and then one click for the eighth note

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.179 
and then one click for the eighth note
so<00:01:01.949> these<00:01:02.190> combined<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:03.149> four<00:01:03.780> clicks<00:01:04.199> which

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so these combined are four clicks which

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
so these combined are four clicks which
is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.790> same<00:01:06.030> equivalent<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.049> half<00:01:07.260> note

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
is the same equivalent as a half note

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.539 
is the same equivalent as a half note
which<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.189> two<00:01:08.400> counts<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.369> rhythm<00:01:11.369> right

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
which is two counts so this rhythm right

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
which is two counts so this rhythm right
here<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.930> I'm

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
here is gonna go just like this if I'm

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.520 
here is gonna go just like this if I'm
playing<00:01:13.260> d0<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.040> d1<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> first<00:01:19.350> one

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
playing d0 and d1 so now the first one

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
playing d0 and d1 so now the first one
is<00:01:19.650> three<00:01:19.920> times<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.280> long<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.180> one

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
is three times as long as the other one

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
is three times as long as the other one
so<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.439> gonna<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.220> times

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so you're gonna see these a lot of times

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
so you're gonna see these a lot of times
together<00:01:24.259> DataCore<00:01:25.259> note<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.830> eighth

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
together DataCore note with an eighth

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.580 
together DataCore note with an eighth
note<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> let's<00:01:27.299> learn<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> song<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.409> with

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
note so let's learn a song actually with

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
note so let's learn a song actually with
dotted<00:01:28.920> quarter<00:01:29.430> notes<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.180> first<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.509> we're

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
dotted quarter notes the first one we're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.100 
dotted quarter notes the first one we're
gonna<00:01:30.720> learn<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.110> called<00:01:31.439> long<00:01:31.740> short<00:01:32.250> long

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
gonna learn is called long short long

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
gonna learn is called long short long
so<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.160> note<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.370> long<00:01:35.610> short<00:01:35.910> long<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so the first note of long short long is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.970 
so the first note of long short long is
going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> data<00:01:36.960> coordinate<00:01:37.560> open<00:01:38.250> D<00:01:38.540> 1<00:01:39.540> 2

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
going to be a data coordinate open D 1 2

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.620 
going to be a data coordinate open D 1 2
and<00:01:40.980> then<00:01:41.490> 8th<00:01:41.910> note<00:01:42.210> D<00:01:42.840> 1<00:01:43.080> 1<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.370> then<00:01:44.430> D<00:01:44.640> 2<00:01:44.910> 4

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and then 8th note D 1 1 and then D 2 4

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.200 
and then 8th note D 1 1 and then D 2 4
data<00:01:45.810> Cornell<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.580> you're<00:01:50.910> thinking

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
data Cornell and then if you're thinking

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
data Cornell and then if you're thinking
a<00:01:51.390> throats<00:01:51.720> each<00:01:52.500> quarter<00:01:52.920> note<00:01:52.980> is<00:01:53.100> actually

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
a throats each quarter note is actually

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.540 
a throats each quarter note is actually
going<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.760> two<00:01:54.150> clicks<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.080> two<00:01:55.230> counts<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
going to be two clicks or two counts so

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.230 
going to be two clicks or two counts so
open<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.470> Cornell<00:01:58.470> 2<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.600> 1<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> 2<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.140> 3<00:02:01.260> a

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
open a Cornell 2 and then a 1 a 2 a 3 a
