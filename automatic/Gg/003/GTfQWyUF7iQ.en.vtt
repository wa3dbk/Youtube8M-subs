me to manually pan and tilt the camera

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.550 
me to manually pan and tilt the camera
independently<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> lift<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> rotation

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
independently of the lift and rotation

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890

movement<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.189> jib<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.119> most<00:01:27.330> jibs<00:01:27.630> only

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
movement of the jib so most jibs only

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.260 
movement of the jib so most jibs only
give<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.080> two<00:01:28.409> movements<00:01:28.650> lift<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.490> rotation

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
give you two movements lift and rotation

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.929 
give you two movements lift and rotation
our<00:01:30.810> handle<00:01:31.320> allows<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> add<00:01:32.310> pan<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
our handle allows you to add pan and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
our handle allows you to add pan and
tilt<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.720> four<00:01:34.020> movements<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.650> do

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
tilt so you have four movements to do

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.520 
tilt so you have four movements to do
these<00:01:35.009> sharp<00:01:35.340> articulated<00:01:36.240> movements<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
these sharp articulated movements so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
these sharp articulated movements so
when<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.850> tilt<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.329> when

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
when I'm going down I can tilt up when

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
when I'm going down I can tilt up when
I'm<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.740> tilt<00:01:41.009> down<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.640> keep

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I'm going up I can tilt down and keep

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.539 
I'm going up I can tilt down and keep

that<00:02:01.590> comes<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:02.159> 799<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.570> it'll<00:02:04.020> turn<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that comes for 799 and it'll turn the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.459 
that comes for 799 and it'll turn the
easy<00:02:04.740> jib<00:02:05.130> into<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.030> medium<00:02:06.540> sized<00:02:06.840> jib<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
easy jib into this medium sized jib that

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.609 
easy jib into this medium sized jib that
you<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.280> behind<00:02:08.580> us<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> booth

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.720 
you see here behind us in the booth
that'll<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> camera<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.120> about

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
that'll get the camera up to about

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.180 
that'll get the camera up to about
probably<00:02:14.730> about<00:02:14.909> 15<00:02:15.390> feet<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.019> air<00:02:16.049> it's<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
probably about 15 feet in the air it's a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
probably about 15 feet in the air it's a
it's<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:17.909> extension<00:02:18.330> kit<00:02:18.659> but<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> has<00:02:19.170> two

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
it's a one extension kit but it has two

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.259 
it's a one extension kit but it has two
sizes<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.519> are<00:02:20.549> two<00:02:20.760> three<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.209> a

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
sizes in it there are two three and a

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.600 
sizes in it there are two three and a
half<00:02:21.299> inch<00:02:21.780> extensions<00:02:22.500> within<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.069> one<00:02:23.280> kit

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
half inch extensions within the one kit

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.410 
half inch extensions within the one kit
so<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.629> basic<00:02:25.019> jib<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:26.040> four<00:02:26.430> foot<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.269> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
so the basic jib is four foot then you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.240 
so the basic jib is four foot then you
can<00:02:27.599> add<00:02:27.780> three<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> half<00:02:28.290> foot<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.950> make<00:02:29.069> it

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
can add three and a half foot to make it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.009 
can add three and a half foot to make it
a<00:02:29.340> seven<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.849> half<00:02:29.879> foot<00:02:30.299> jib<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.870> then

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
a seven and a half foot jib and then

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.869 
a seven and a half foot jib and then
another<00:02:31.290> three<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.799> half<00:02:31.829> to<00:02:32.159> make<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.430> 11

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
another three and a half to make it 11

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.420 
another three and a half to make it 11

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
when were to hit this the wind would go

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.160 
when were to hit this the wind would go
through<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.730> thing<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.150> also<00:03:48.420> makes<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.960> a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
through the thing it also makes it a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.370 
through the thing it also makes it a
little<00:03:49.620> bit<00:03:49.860> lighter<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:51.420> stores<00:03:52.080> and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
little bit lighter so that it stores and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.050 
little bit lighter so that it stores and
packs<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.920> travels<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.490> little<00:03:53.760> bit<00:03:53.850> easier

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
packs and travels a little bit easier

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.810 
packs and travels a little bit easier

you spent the money for the servo for
the<00:06:30.070> motors<00:06:30.490> on<00:06:30.700> this<00:06:30.880> controller<00:06:31.510> and<00:06:31.810> for

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
the motors on this controller and for

the motors on this controller and for
the<00:06:32.140> joystick<00:06:32.680> why<00:06:32.890> not<00:06:33.100> have<00:06:33.340> it<00:06:33.370> have

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
the joystick why not have it have

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.910 
the joystick why not have it have
multiple<00:06:34.450> purposes<00:06:34.840> so<00:06:35.230> there's<00:06:35.680> other

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
multiple purposes so there's other

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.800 
multiple purposes so there's other
accessories<00:06:36.520> like<00:06:36.700> turntables<00:06:37.510> and<00:06:37.630> other

accessories like turntables and other
things<00:06:38.140> that<00:06:38.290> it<00:06:38.440> can<00:06:38.470> also<00:06:38.770> drive<00:06:39.280> so<00:06:39.550> just

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
things that it can also drive so just

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.500 
things that it can also drive so just
multi<00:06:40.630> uses<00:06:41.620> for<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.100> joystick<00:06:42.610> control<00:06:43.030> and
