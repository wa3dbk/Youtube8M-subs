00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
what do we do once the flies in the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
water well a lot of people's I do the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.080 
water well a lot of people's I do the
fly<00:00:50.620> fishing<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.130> little<00:00:51.400> fly<00:00:51.610> sitting<00:00:51.880> on

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
fly fishing is a little fly sitting on

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.340 
fly fishing is a little fly sitting on
the<00:00:52.180> surface<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.750> water<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.260> fish

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
the surface of the water and the fish

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.960 
the surface of the water and the fish
comes<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.770> takes<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.250> always<00:00:54.370> my<00:00:54.730> idea

comes and takes it it's always my idea
yeah<00:00:55.810> in<00:00:56.110> in<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.130> real<00:00:57.370> world

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
yeah in in the real world

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.970 
yeah in in the real world
yes<00:00:58.330> dry<00:00:58.570> fly<00:00:58.810> fishing<00:00:58.840> if<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.590> conditions

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
yes dry fly fishing if the conditions

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.200 
yes dry fly fishing if the conditions
are<00:01:00.070> right<00:01:00.130> but<00:01:00.430> most<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.850> time<00:01:01.030> we're

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
are right but most of the time we're

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.720 
are right but most of the time we're
fishing<00:01:01.510> subsurface<00:01:02.020> as<00:01:02.410> we<00:01:03.070> are<00:01:03.220> now<00:01:03.460> with<00:01:03.700> a

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
fishing subsurface as we are now with a

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.880 
fishing subsurface as we are now with a
damsel<00:01:04.180> nymph<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.870> we<00:01:04.960> have<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.229> retrieve<00:01:05.650> that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
damsel nymph so we have to retrieve that

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.040 
damsel nymph so we have to retrieve that
fly<00:01:06.130> we<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.460> pull<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.760> in<00:01:07.000> there's<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.810> few

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
fly we have to pull it in there's a few

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.390 
fly we have to pull it in there's a few
basic<00:01:08.229> retrieves<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:10.479> drops<00:01:11.140> rod<00:01:11.590> low<00:01:12.340> to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
basic retrieves again drops rod low to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
basic retrieves again drops rod low to
the<00:01:12.580> water<00:01:12.670> tip<00:01:13.330> down<00:01:13.570> at<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.840> water<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:16.210> that

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
the water tip down at the water in that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.330 
the water tip down at the water in that
sense<00:01:16.750> everything's<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.680> straight<00:01:17.979> line<00:01:18.009> if

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
sense everything's in a straight line if

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
sense everything's in a straight line if
a<00:01:18.430> fish<00:01:18.640> pulls<00:01:18.970> on<00:01:19.210> there<00:01:19.420> you'll<00:01:19.570> feel<00:01:19.810> it

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
a fish pulls on there you'll feel it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260 
a fish pulls on there you'll feel it
straight<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.590> rod<00:01:20.770> tip<00:01:20.979> okay<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.520> this<00:01:21.970> is

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
straight to the rod tip okay and this is

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
straight to the rod tip okay and this is
we<00:01:22.540> do<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.930> slow<00:01:23.259> pulling<00:01:23.710> retrieve<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:26.080> the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
we do a slow pulling retrieve all the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.320 
we do a slow pulling retrieve all the
time<00:01:26.500> we're<00:01:26.680> doing<00:01:26.920> those<00:01:27.070> little<00:01:27.430> slow<00:01:27.850> pulls

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
time we're doing those little slow pulls

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.850 
time we're doing those little slow pulls
like<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.869> flow<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.290> lifting<00:01:29.710> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
like that that flow is lifting and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.430 
like that that flow is lifting and
dropping<00:01:29.890> okay<00:01:30.490> okay<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.050> slow

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
dropping okay okay so that's a slow

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.150 
dropping okay okay so that's a slow
retrieve<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:34.869> get<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.200> about<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.860> sort

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
retrieve when you get to about that sort

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.830 
retrieve when you get to about that sort
of<00:01:36.190> distance<00:01:36.400> use<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.940> rod<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.390> lift

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
of distance use the rod to lift

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.870 
of distance use the rod to lift
don't<00:01:38.440> pull<00:01:38.650> all<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.890> fly<00:01:39.070> line<00:01:39.310> into<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.670> rod

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
don't pull all the fly line into the rod

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.030 
don't pull all the fly line into the rod
use<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.660> rod<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.020> lift<00:01:41.200> up<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.530> can<00:01:41.680> see<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
use the rod to lift up you can see the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.469 
use the rod to lift up you can see the
fly<00:01:42.250> they're<00:01:42.520> coming<00:01:42.789> there's<00:01:42.970> nothing<00:01:43.300> after

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
fly they're coming there's nothing after

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.440 
fly they're coming there's nothing after
it<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.869> then<00:01:44.380> back<00:01:44.590> into<00:01:44.800> another<00:01:45.130> casting<00:01:45.670> we

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it and then back into another casting we

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.779 
it and then back into another casting we
will<00:01:46.630> then<00:01:46.810> look<00:01:47.050> at<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:53.140> now<00:01:53.380> we'll<00:01:54.100> try<00:01:54.369> a

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
will then look at so now we'll try a

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.730 
will then look at so now we'll try a
slightly<00:01:55.179> faster<00:01:55.720> retrieve<00:01:56.110> again

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
slightly faster retrieve again

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.680 
slightly faster retrieve again
everything<00:01:57.369> in<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.550> straight<00:01:57.880> line<00:01:57.910> point<00:01:58.479> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
everything in a straight line point the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.260 
everything in a straight line point the
rod<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.080> water<00:01:59.319> and<00:01:59.979> at<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.369> fly<00:02:00.610> anything

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
rod at the water and at the fly anything

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.969 
rod at the water and at the fly anything
pulls<00:02:01.660> that<00:02:01.899> will<00:02:02.080> feel<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:02.470> straight<00:02:02.740> away

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
pulls that will feel it straight away

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.950 
pulls that will feel it straight away
now<00:02:03.429> we'll<00:02:03.610> do<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.759> faster<00:02:04.149> retreat<00:02:04.450> okay

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
now we'll do a faster retreat okay

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.749 
now we'll do a faster retreat okay
faster<00:02:05.710> twitchy<00:02:06.520> retrieve

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.429 

all<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.970> time<00:02:11.150> that's<00:02:11.689> keeping<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.170> flight

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
all the time that's keeping that flight

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.080 
all the time that's keeping that flight
nearer<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> surface<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.640> faster<00:02:13.970> you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
nearer to the surface the faster you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000 
nearer to the surface the faster you
retrieve<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.720> higher<00:02:15.079> in<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.379> water<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.829> fly

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
retrieve the higher in the water the fly

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.490 
retrieve the higher in the water the fly
stays<00:02:16.370> okay<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.239> slower<00:02:17.659> retrieval<00:02:18.319> fish

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
stays okay so a slower retrieval fish

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.670 
stays okay so a slower retrieval fish
your<00:02:18.680> fly<00:02:18.920> data<00:02:19.269> faster<00:02:20.269> retrieve<00:02:20.599> will<00:02:21.470> bring

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
your fly data faster retrieve will bring

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.280 
your fly data faster retrieve will bring
it<00:02:21.799> up<00:02:21.890> near<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> surface<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.970> again<00:02:23.810> lift

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
it up near to the surface and again lift

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.890 
it up near to the surface and again lift
have<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.709> look<00:02:24.920> at<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.129> fly<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:26.480> nothing

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
have a look at the fly there's nothing

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.530 
have a look at the fly there's nothing
after<00:02:27.079> it<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.950> again<00:02:28.250> back<00:02:28.670> into<00:02:28.970> another<00:02:29.150> cast

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
after it so again back into another cast

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.789 
after it so again back into another cast
nice<00:02:30.409> and<00:02:30.680> control<00:02:32.620> okay

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
nice and control okay

slow<00:02:58.430> steady<00:02:59.090> pace<00:02:59.239> okay<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.889> nymph

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
slow steady pace okay so that nymph

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.960 
slow steady pace okay so that nymph
would<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.650> bottom<00:03:03.980> yet<00:03:04.310> gently

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
would just be the bottom yet gently

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.390 
would just be the bottom yet gently
moving<00:03:05.180> along<00:03:05.629> and<00:03:05.810> again<00:03:06.409> very<00:03:06.769> every<00:03:07.250> now

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
moving along and again very every now

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.160 
moving along and again very every now
and<00:03:07.519> then<00:03:07.609> two<00:03:08.299> or<00:03:08.450> three<00:03:08.569> little<00:03:08.780> twitches

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
and then two or three little twitches

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.660 
and then two or three little twitches
just<00:03:09.379> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.680> bit<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.859> life<00:03:10.040> something<00:03:10.400> a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
just a little bit of life something a

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.309 
just a little bit of life something a
little<00:03:10.939> bit<00:03:11.090> different<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.659> sometimes<00:03:12.139> will

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
little bit different that sometimes will

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.369 
little bit different that sometimes will
trigger<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.650> take<00:03:13.120> but<00:03:14.120> again<00:03:14.389> at<00:03:14.599> all<00:03:14.840> times

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
trigger a take but again at all times

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.770 
trigger a take but again at all times
keep<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.340> rod<00:03:16.579> tip<00:03:16.849> pointing<00:03:17.389> at<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> water

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
keep that rod tip pointing at the water

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.839 
keep that rod tip pointing at the water
so<00:03:18.109> everything's<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.919> straight<00:03:19.250> line<00:03:19.280> any

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
so everything's in a straight line any

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.180 
so everything's in a straight line any
kind<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.269> movement<00:03:21.019> on<00:03:21.379> that<00:03:21.410> fly<00:03:21.769> line<00:03:22.010> you'll

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
kind of movement on that fly line you'll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.009 
kind of movement on that fly line you'll
feel<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.609> straightaway<00:03:23.060> here<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.660> lot<00:03:23.989> of

feel it straightaway here a lot of

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.689 
feel it straightaway here a lot of
people<00:03:24.199> stand<00:03:24.680> there<00:03:24.859> with<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.040> big<00:03:25.250> loop<00:03:25.519> of

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
people stand there with a big loop of

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
line from the tip of the rod you haven't

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.009 
line from the tip of the rod you haven't
you<00:03:28.489> haven't<00:03:28.760> got<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.000> feel<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.750> actual

you haven't got the feel to the actual
fly<00:03:30.260> with<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.609> holding<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.449> rod<00:03:32.599> above

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
fly with with that holding the rod above

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.449 
fly with with that holding the rod above
the<00:03:32.959> water<00:03:33.169> like<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:35.949> and<00:03:36.949> back<00:03:37.159> out<00:03:37.340> there

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
the water like that and back out there

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.520 
the water like that and back out there
again<00:03:37.639> one<00:03:38.479> other<00:03:38.629> thing<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.930> really<00:03:39.290> want<00:03:39.440> to

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
again one other thing I really want to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.589 
again one other thing I really want to
mention<00:03:39.829> when<00:03:39.919> we're<00:03:40.099> doing<00:03:40.220> retrieving<00:03:40.879> that

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
mention when we're doing retrieving that

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.020 
mention when we're doing retrieving that
I<00:03:41.659> hadn't<00:03:41.959> thought<00:03:42.139> of<00:03:42.199> is<00:03:42.769> this<00:03:43.280> index<00:03:43.699> finger

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
I hadn't thought of is this index finger

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.089 
I hadn't thought of is this index finger
is<00:03:44.090> very<00:03:44.120> important<00:03:44.870> okay<00:03:45.470> because<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.979> is

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
is very important okay because that is

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.640 
is very important okay because that is
your<00:03:46.280> control<00:03:46.729> over<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.180> line<00:03:47.359> okay<00:03:48.049> as<00:03:48.409> I've

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
your control over the line okay as I've

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.619 
your control over the line okay as I've
said<00:03:48.829> earlier<00:03:48.889> we<00:03:49.370> don't<00:03:49.609> use<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.150> real<00:03:50.329> lot<00:03:50.599> I

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
said earlier we don't use the real lot I

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.080 
said earlier we don't use the real lot I
certainly<00:03:51.169> don't<00:03:51.409> I<00:03:51.590> play<00:03:51.859> fish<00:03:52.129> by<00:03:52.310> hand<00:03:52.340> but

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
certainly don't I play fish by hand but

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.349 
certainly don't I play fish by hand but
this<00:03:53.209> index<00:03:53.659> finger<00:03:54.049> here<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.620> your<00:03:54.859> control

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
this index finger here is your control

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.569 
this index finger here is your control
okay<00:03:56.389> this<00:03:56.840> hand<00:03:57.079> underneath<00:03:57.379> that<00:03:57.709> index

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
okay this hand underneath that index

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.460 
okay this hand underneath that index
finger<00:03:58.669> and<00:03:59.000> you're<00:03:59.479> pulling<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.139> a<00:04:00.290> fish

finger and lift into the fish okay so
control<00:04:05.599> with<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> index<00:04:06.169> finger<00:04:07.150> everything

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
control with the index finger everything

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.330 
control with the index finger everything
get<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.329> nice<00:04:08.510> straight<00:04:08.870> line<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.409> just<00:04:10.129> do<00:04:10.310> a
