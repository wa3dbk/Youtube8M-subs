00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
roblox game development tutorial this

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.400 
roblox game development tutorial this
tutorial<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:06.089> going<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.420> continue<00:00:06.750> scripting

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
tutorial is going to continue scripting

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.080 
tutorial is going to continue scripting
and<00:00:07.830> we're<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> learn<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.639> little<00:00:08.940> bit

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
and we're going to learn a little bit

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.120 
and we're going to learn a little bit
okay<00:00:09.929> actually<00:00:10.349> we're<00:00:10.679> not<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> learn

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
okay actually we're not going to learn

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.580 
okay actually we're not going to learn
too<00:00:11.309> much<00:00:11.840> because<00:00:12.840> we're<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
too much because we're just going to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.769 
too much because we're just going to
cover<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.730> how<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> navigate<00:00:16.680> through<00:00:17.779> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
cover the how to navigate through the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.340 
cover the how to navigate through the
hierarchy<00:00:19.730> that<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.150> seen<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
hierarchy that can be seen in the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.189 
hierarchy that can be seen in the
Explorer<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:23.539> we're<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> learn<00:00:24.960> how

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
Explorer here we're going to learn how

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.290 
Explorer here we're going to learn how
to<00:00:25.230> navigate<00:00:25.529> through<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.310> by<00:00:26.789> scripting

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
to navigate through that by scripting

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.179 
to navigate through that by scripting
because<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> big<00:00:29.039> big<00:00:29.760> part<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
because this is a big big part of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
because this is a big big part of
scripting<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.390> without<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.780> can't<00:00:34.050> do

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
scripting and without it you can't do

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
scripting and without it you can't do
too<00:00:34.590> much<00:00:34.829> um<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.870> might<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:37.920> properties

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
too much um we might go over properties

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
too much um we might go over properties
or<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.629> might<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.989> next<00:00:40.200> tutorial<00:00:40.739> through

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
or that might be next tutorial through

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.280 
or that might be next tutorial through
scripting<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:42.120> sure<00:00:42.420> yet<00:00:42.600> we'll<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.230> we

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
scripting not sure yet we'll see how we

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.139 
scripting not sure yet we'll see how we
are<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.770> time<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:46.520> then<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:48.030> going

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
are on time and then I know we're going

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.069 
are on time and then I know we're going
to<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:49.340> built-in<00:00:50.340> functions<00:00:51.149> very

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to be going over built-in functions very

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.920 
to be going over built-in functions very
soon<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:53.690> let's<00:00:54.690> let's<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:56.280> started<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.730> guess

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
soon so let's let's get started I guess

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.520 
soon so let's let's get started I guess
alright<00:00:57.930> we'll<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> our<00:00:58.410> script<00:00:58.920> and<00:01:00.530> take

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
alright we'll go to our script and take

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.420 
alright we'll go to our script and take
out<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.829> print<00:01:02.160> hello<00:01:02.430> world<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:05.129> step

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
out this print hello world so first step

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.190 
out this print hello world so first step
is<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.900> finding<00:01:07.760> let's<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
is going to be just finding let's just

is going to be just finding let's just
here<00:01:10.200> we'll<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.770> print<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.049> want

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
here we'll do print and what do we want

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580 
here we'll do print and what do we want
to<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.030> well<00:01:18.060> let's<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.659> print<00:01:18.930> gate<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to go to well let's just print gate and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
to go to well let's just print gate and
let's<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.009> print<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> workspace<00:01:20.939> how<00:01:21.840> do

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
let's just print the workspace how do

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.370 
let's just print the workspace how do
you<00:01:22.110> print<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> workspace<00:01:23.070> well<00:01:23.880> typing<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you print the workspace well typing you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
you print the workspace well typing you
can<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.369> things<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
can do one of two things when you can

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.080 
can do one of two things when you can
type<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.450> workspace<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> uncapitalized

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
type in workspace with a uncapitalized

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.219 
type in workspace with a uncapitalized
by<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.360> everything<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.900> case-sensitive

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
by the way everything is case-sensitive

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.270 
by the way everything is case-sensitive
I'm<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.520> scripting<00:01:33.150> basically<00:01:34.280> basically

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I'm in scripting basically basically

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.069 
I'm in scripting basically basically
everything<00:01:36.590> print<00:01:37.590> workspace<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.810> over

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
everything print workspace if we go over

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.210 
everything print workspace if we go over
here<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.850> click<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> play<00:01:42.540> button

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
here and we just click this play button

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.179 
here and we just click this play button
we'll<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.430> there's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:45.649> little<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.070> an

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
we'll see there's a little bit of an

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.399 
we'll see there's a little bit of an
error<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:50.689> we're<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> explain

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
error here we're not going to explain

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.740 
error here we're not going to explain
the<00:01:52.649> error<00:01:52.860> yet<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> do

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the error yet because I'm going to do

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
the error yet because I'm going to do
that<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.140> another<00:01:55.439> tutorial<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.579> we've

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that in another tutorial and we've

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.569 
that in another tutorial and we've
gotten<00:01:57.060> further<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> we're<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.159> going

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
gotten further so we're actually going

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
gotten further so we're actually going
to<00:01:59.729> do<00:02:00.320> print<00:02:01.320> workspace<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.210> error<00:02:03.450> kind

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to do print workspace and the error kind

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.050 
to do print workspace and the error kind
of<00:02:04.140> was<00:02:04.409> hey<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.490> no<00:02:05.520> clue<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:05.969> you're

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
of was hey we have no clue what you're

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
of was hey we have no clue what you're
doing<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.600> had<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> space<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.740> just

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
doing because you had a space so just

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.430 
doing because you had a space so just
make<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.580> function<00:02:09.330> sort<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.229> should

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
make it a function sort of and it should

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.430 
make it a function sort of and it should
work<00:02:10.649> better

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
work better

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.980 
work better
so<00:02:12.620> we'll<00:02:12.770> go<00:02:12.920> over<00:02:13.100> here<00:02:13.280> we'll<00:02:13.490> close<00:02:13.700> it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so we'll go over here we'll close it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.450 
so we'll go over here we'll close it
pause<00:02:14.990> play<00:02:17.440> okay<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.800> go<00:02:18.980> over<00:02:19.100> here<00:02:19.220> and

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
pause play okay just go over here and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.870 
pause play okay just go over here and
disable<00:02:20.920> create<00:02:21.920> reenable

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
disable create reenable

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.470 
disable create reenable
and<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.540> get<00:02:23.890> workspace<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.370> praying<00:02:25.880> workspace

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
and we get workspace a praying workspace

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.200 
and we get workspace a praying workspace
for<00:02:26.780> us<00:02:26.900> with<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> capital<00:02:27.530> W<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:28.790> know<00:02:28.970> it's

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
for us with a capital W so we know it's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.960 
for us with a capital W so we know it's
not<00:02:29.330> printing<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.960> string<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.370> string<00:02:31.430> we

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
not printing a string the a string we

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.390 
not printing a string the a string we
inputted<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.740> actually<00:02:33.740> printing<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:37.130> name

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
inputted it's actually printing the name

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.910 
inputted it's actually printing the name
of<00:02:37.670> an<00:02:37.790> object<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.750> found<00:02:39.110> through<00:02:39.740> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
of an object that you found through the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.500 
of an object that you found through the
Explorers<00:02:40.520> hierarchy<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:44.060> found<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:46.510> now

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
Explorers hierarchy so we found that now

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.980 
Explorers hierarchy so we found that now
what<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:47.990> we<00:02:48.140> want<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.590> print<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.240> name<00:02:50.630> of

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
what if we want to print out the name of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.220 
what if we want to print out the name of
one<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.860> these<00:02:51.950> Brit<00:02:52.370> Air<00:02:52.880> Base<00:02:53.240> base<00:02:53.810> because

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
one of these Brit Air Base base because

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.960 
one of these Brit Air Base base because
there's<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.470> million<00:02:54.740> bricks<00:02:55.010> well<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:55.820> I'm

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
there's a million bricks well if I'm

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.240 
there's a million bricks well if I'm
wanting<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.270> do<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:56.600> base<00:02:57.250> well

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
wanting to do that for base well

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.710 
wanting to do that for base well
actually<00:02:58.580> no<00:02:58.910> first<00:02:59.210> I'll<00:02:59.390> show<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.570> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
actually no first I'll show you the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.210 
actually no first I'll show you the
second<00:03:00.260> way<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.410> how<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.740> get<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
second way of how to get to the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.160 
second way of how to get to the
workspace<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.270> this<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.630> sort<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.990> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
workspace so this is sort of the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.210 
workspace so this is sort of the
shortcut<00:03:03.740> but<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.210> way<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.450> prefer<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.260> game

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
shortcut but the way I prefer is game

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.880 
shortcut but the way I prefer is game
that<00:03:07.640> workspace<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.510> game<00:03:09.020> has<00:03:09.350> literally

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
that workspace and game has literally

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.250 
that workspace and game has literally
the<00:03:10.070> game<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.640> starts<00:03:11.300> it's<00:03:11.810> everything

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the game it starts it's everything

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.130 
the game it starts it's everything
everything<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.370> inside<00:03:13.730> game<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.240> then<00:03:14.960> you

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
everything is inside game and then you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.410 
everything is inside game and then you
go<00:03:15.290> down<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.650> workspace<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.610> everything<00:03:17.300> in

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
go down to workspace and everything in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.600 
go down to workspace and everything in
that<00:03:17.450> lighting<00:03:18.410> everything<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.280> players

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
that lighting everything in that players

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.699 
that lighting everything in that players
everything<00:03:20.300> in<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.350> forth<00:03:21.620> for

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
everything in that and so forth for

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.250 
everything in that and so forth for
every<00:03:22.220> everything<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.390> we'll<00:03:26.390> print<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.990> out

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
every everything so we'll print this out

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.880 
every everything so we'll print this out
all<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.100> have<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.370> do<00:03:28.490> is<00:03:28.640> go<00:03:28.820> down<00:03:28.940> here<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.890> by

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
all we have to do is go down here and by

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.370 
all we have to do is go down here and by
disabling<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:32.090> script<00:03:32.510> we're<00:03:32.810> stopping<00:03:33.350> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
disabling the script we're stopping the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.010 
disabling the script we're stopping the
script<00:03:33.890> making<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.580> not<00:03:34.820> able<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.420> do<00:03:35.570> anything

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
script making it not able to do anything

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.320 
script making it not able to do anything
and<00:03:36.560> then<00:03:36.680> by<00:03:36.920> Rhian<00:03:37.310> abling<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.910> we're<00:03:38.060> really

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
and then by Rhian abling it we're really

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.970 
and then by Rhian abling it we're really
restarting<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.380> script<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:41.530> when<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:42.650> do<00:03:42.770> that

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
restarting the script so when we do that

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.610 
restarting the script so when we do that
we'll<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.120> printed<00:03:44.540> workspace<00:03:45.020> again<00:03:45.230> down

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
we'll see a printed workspace again down

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.910 
we'll see a printed workspace again down
here<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.100> output<00:03:46.989> now<00:03:47.989> let's<00:03:48.650> get<00:03:48.860> to

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
here in the output now let's get to

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.790 
here in the output now let's get to
printing<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.640> base<00:03:49.880> okay<00:03:50.570> now<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.380> didn't

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
printing that base okay now I didn't

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.670 
printing that base okay now I didn't
explain<00:03:52.100> too<00:03:52.370> much<00:03:53.200> about<00:03:54.200> this<00:03:54.410> game<00:03:54.620> that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
explain too much about this game that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.830 
explain too much about this game that
workspace<00:03:55.160> thing<00:03:55.610> but<00:03:56.330> I'm<00:03:56.420> going<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.720> explain

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
workspace thing but I'm going to explain

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.610 
workspace thing but I'm going to explain
a<00:03:57.110> little<00:03:57.350> bit<00:03:57.530> more<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:59.450> game<00:03:59.989> dot

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
a little bit more now so game dot

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.830 
a little bit more now so game dot
workspace<00:04:01.430> why<00:04:01.670> do<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.940> keep<00:04:02.120> saying<00:04:02.180> game<00:04:02.600> dot

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
workspace why do I keep saying game dot

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.330 
workspace why do I keep saying game dot
workspace<00:04:03.260> why<00:04:03.470> isn't<00:04:03.770> it<00:04:03.800> just<00:04:03.860> game

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
workspace why isn't it just game

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.479 
workspace why isn't it just game
workspace<00:04:04.850> or<00:04:05.060> workspace<00:04:06.020> or<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.489> games

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
workspace or workspace or the games

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.070 
workspace or workspace or the games
workspace<00:04:08.230> well<00:04:09.230> in<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:10.100> lot<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.400> different

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
workspace well in a lot of different

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.360 
workspace well in a lot of different
object-oriented<00:04:12.080> programming<00:04:12.620> or<00:04:12.920> scripting

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
object-oriented programming or scripting

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.500 
object-oriented programming or scripting
languages<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:16.070> get<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.609> children<00:04:17.150> or<00:04:17.330> the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
languages you get the children or the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.279 
languages you get the children or the
descendants<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.669> different<00:04:19.669> objects<00:04:20.570> game<00:04:21.080> is

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
descendants of different objects game is

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.920 
descendants of different objects game is
an<00:04:21.500> object<00:04:22.070> here<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:23.090> object<00:04:23.630> is<00:04:23.780> the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
an object here and the object is the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.300 
an object here and the object is the
entire<00:04:24.229> game

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
entire game

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.640 
entire game
you<00:04:25.669> could<00:04:25.880> almost<00:04:26.030> call<00:04:26.270> them<00:04:26.570> sub<00:04:26.870> objects

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
you could almost call them sub objects

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.760 
you could almost call them sub objects
it's<00:04:28.280> more<00:04:28.610> common<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.030> call<00:04:29.210> them<00:04:29.360> children

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
it's more common to call them children

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.740 
it's more common to call them children
you<00:04:30.770> get<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.100> objects<00:04:31.550> children<00:04:32.090> usually<00:04:32.330> by

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
you get the objects children usually by

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.159 
you get the objects children usually by
putting<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.320> period<00:04:34.040> or<00:04:34.540> what's<00:04:35.540> called<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.930> dot

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
putting a period or what's called a dot

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.340 
putting a period or what's called a dot
separator<00:04:36.800> sometimes<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.669> just<00:04:38.660> call<00:04:39.050> it<00:04:39.080> dot

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
separator sometimes I just call it dot

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.940 
separator sometimes I just call it dot
because<00:04:39.650> it's<00:04:39.800> quicker<00:04:40.040> sounds<00:04:40.910> closer<00:04:41.180> to

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
because it's quicker sounds closer to

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.670 
because it's quicker sounds closer to
you<00:04:42.950> put<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.820> then<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:45.050> programming

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
you put it that and then the programming

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.280 
you put it that and then the programming
compiler<00:04:46.430> will<00:04:46.730> know<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.660> want<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.110> go

compiler will know that you want to go

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.310

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
child of it in this instance you want to

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.590 
child of it in this instance you want to
find<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.040> child<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:19.880> you're<00:05:20.030> going<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.360> go

find the child so you're going to go

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.409 
find the child so you're going to go
into<00:05:20.900> game<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.380> then<00:05:21.790> think<00:05:22.790> of<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:23.030> current

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
into game and then think of it current

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.440 
into game and then think of it current
here<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:25.190> should<00:05:25.400> this<00:05:25.669> should<00:05:25.970> give<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.330> good

and<00:05:53.300> pretend<00:05:54.229> that<00:05:54.320> backslash<00:05:55.039> is<00:05:55.250> really<00:05:55.580> a

it's case sensitive so you do have to
capitalize<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:51.330> as<00:06:51.450> you<00:06:51.720> capitalized<00:06:52.350> it<00:06:52.620> in

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
capitalize it as you capitalized it in

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.070 
capitalize it as you capitalized it in
your<00:06:53.130> game<00:06:53.840> dot<00:06:54.840> base<00:06:56.000> so<00:06:57.000> now<00:06:57.180> you<00:06:57.810> go<00:06:57.990> to<00:06:58.050> the

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
your game dot base so now you go to the

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.130 
your game dot base so now you go to the
place<00:06:58.320> one<00:06:58.970> will<00:06:59.970> go<00:07:00.090> to<00:07:00.120> the<00:07:00.450> script<00:07:03.140> disable

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140 
place one will go to the script disable

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.600 
place one will go to the script disable
enable<00:07:05.240> enable<00:07:06.240> and<00:07:06.420> they<00:07:07.350> printed<00:07:07.800> base<00:07:08.010> for

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
enable enable and they printed base for

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.640 
enable enable and they printed base for
us<00:07:09.230> so<00:07:10.230> base<00:07:10.680> is<00:07:10.950> now<00:07:11.190> there<00:07:11.850> and<00:07:12.230> we<00:07:13.230> know<00:07:13.470> it's

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
us so base is now there and we know it's

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.170 
us so base is now there and we know it's
there<00:07:13.860> because<00:07:14.070> we<00:07:14.550> printed<00:07:15.000> it<00:07:15.120> and<00:07:16.400> so<00:07:17.400> it's

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
there because we printed it and so it's

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.700 
there because we printed it and so it's
a<00:07:18.240> little<00:07:18.480> bit<00:07:18.690> of<00:07:18.840> how<00:07:18.990> to<00:07:19.050> go<00:07:19.320> through<00:07:19.350> the

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:19.710 
a little bit of how to go through the

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.080 
a little bit of how to go through the
hierarchy<00:07:21.170> is<00:07:22.170> through<00:07:22.530> scripting<00:07:23.040> next<00:07:24.000> the

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
hierarchy is through scripting next the

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.030 
hierarchy is through scripting next the
tutorial<00:07:24.690> because<00:07:24.930> this<00:07:25.260> has<00:07:25.470> been<00:07:25.740> longer

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040 
tutorial because this has been longer

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.300 
tutorial because this has been longer
than<00:07:26.220> I<00:07:26.280> wanted<00:07:26.850> it<00:07:27.000> to<00:07:27.150> be<00:07:27.710> next<00:07:28.710> tutorial

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
than I wanted it to be next tutorial

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.970 
than I wanted it to be next tutorial
we'll<00:07:29.670> be<00:07:29.780> printing<00:07:30.780> the<00:07:31.260> values<00:07:31.740> of

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:31.980 
we'll be printing the values of

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.560 
we'll be printing the values of
properties<00:07:33.140> of<00:07:34.140> different<00:07:34.530> objects<00:07:34.920> and

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570 
properties of different objects and

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.870 
properties of different objects and
after<00:07:36.570> that<00:07:36.780> we'll<00:07:36.960> probably<00:07:37.200> go<00:07:37.440> into

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:37.880 
after that we'll probably go into

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.110 
after that we'll probably go into
built-in<00:07:38.880> functions<00:07:39.360> in<00:07:39.660> Lua<00:07:40.460> so<00:07:41.460> thank<00:07:42.000> you

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 
built-in functions in Lua so thank you

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.090 
built-in functions in Lua so thank you
