partner analysis of Sabre and cute sue
from<00:00:02.700> fate<00:00:02.970> zero<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.540> think<00:00:03.959> most<00:00:04.140> people<00:00:04.350> can

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
from fate zero I think most people can

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.829 
from fate zero I think most people can
agree<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.190> pair<00:00:05.700> would<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.240> been

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
agree that this pair would have been

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.100 
agree that this pair would have been
really<00:00:07.649> powerful<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.400> very<00:00:08.550> dynamic<00:00:09.300> had

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
really powerful and very dynamic had

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.499 
really powerful and very dynamic had
they<00:00:10.349> gotten<00:00:11.010> along<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:12.330> worked

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
they gotten along and actually worked

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.570 
they gotten along and actually worked
together<00:00:12.719> they<00:00:13.380> were<00:00:13.440> not<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.740> compatible<00:00:14.370> duo

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
together they were not a compatible duo

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.870 
together they were not a compatible duo
and<00:00:14.969> they<00:00:15.660> didn't<00:00:16.080> even<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.340> similar<00:00:17.340> ideals

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and they didn't even have similar ideals

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.410 
and they didn't even have similar ideals
or<00:00:18.240> way<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.710> approaching<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.340> Grail<00:00:20.580> war<00:00:20.910> this

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
or way of approaching the Grail war this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.710 
or way of approaching the Grail war this
resulted<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.619> few<00:00:23.220> scenes<00:00:23.760> shared<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
resulted in very few scenes shared and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
resulted in very few scenes shared and
when<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.680> did<00:00:25.740> talk<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.340> each<00:00:26.609> other<00:00:26.760> they

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
when they did talk to each other they

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.320 
when they did talk to each other they
were<00:00:27.599> always<00:00:28.400> disagreeing<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.699> their<00:00:30.179> own

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
were always disagreeing on their own

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.620 
were always disagreeing on their own
kiyotsugu<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.560> saber<00:00:31.890> were<00:00:32.579> arguably<00:00:33.480> some

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
kiyotsugu and saber were arguably some

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.900 
kiyotsugu and saber were arguably some
of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> most<00:00:34.230> powerful<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> masters<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
of the most powerful of the masters and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.580 
of the most powerful of the masters and
the<00:00:36.090> servants<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.079> should<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.440> been

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the servants so they should have been

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
the servants so they should have been
able<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.950> sweep<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> competition<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.540> their

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
able to sweep the competition but their

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.119 
able to sweep the competition but their
inability<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.350> communicate<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.800> each<00:00:40.980> other

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
inability to communicate with each other

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
inability to communicate with each other
definitely<00:00:41.460> hindered<00:00:42.210> their<00:00:42.420> success

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
definitely hindered their success

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
definitely hindered their success
because<00:00:43.770> although<00:00:43.980> technically<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.969> guess

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
because although technically I guess

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.110 
because although technically I guess
they<00:00:45.539> did<00:00:45.899> win<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:47.100> ended<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.460> losing<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
they did win they ended up losing the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
they did win they ended up losing the
hardest<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.379> fair<00:00:49.620> saber<00:00:50.070> did<00:00:50.430> try<00:00:50.760> very

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
hardest to be fair saber did try very

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.660 
hardest to be fair saber did try very
hard<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.870> figure<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.649> Kitty<00:00:52.890> sugu<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> work

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
hard to figure out Kitty sugu and work

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.930 
hard to figure out Kitty sugu and work
with<00:00:53.910> him<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.360> he<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.809> refused<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.980> give<00:00:56.670> her

with him but he just refused to give her
anything<00:00:57.480> he<00:00:58.170> dismissed<00:00:58.890> her<00:00:59.129> notion<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
anything he dismissed her notion of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
anything he dismissed her notion of
jewelry<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.260> didn't<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.350> even<00:01:01.500> care

if<00:01:08.460> he<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> stomp<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.420> over<00:01:09.450> even<00:01:09.990> his

if he had to stomp all over even his

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
if he had to stomp all over even his

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
partners then as far as he was concerned

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.440 
partners then as far as he was concerned
it<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.110> okay<00:01:13.590> he<00:01:14.040> went<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.790> Grail<00:01:15.150> war

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it was okay he went into that Grail war

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 
it was okay he went into that Grail war
with<00:01:15.750> his<00:01:16.020> game<00:01:16.290> plan<00:01:16.320> already<00:01:16.979> mapped<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
with his game plan already mapped out so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
with his game plan already mapped out so
regardless<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:19.110> servant<00:01:19.650> he<00:01:19.830> ended<00:01:20.280> up

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
regardless of which servant he ended up

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.760 
regardless of which servant he ended up
with<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:21.030> sure<00:01:21.330> he<00:01:21.720> would<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:21.930> behaved<00:01:22.409> in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
with I'm sure he would have behaved in

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
with I'm sure he would have behaved in
the<00:01:23.100> exact<00:01:23.580> same<00:01:23.880> way<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.810> saber

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the exact same way and I think saber

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.780 
the exact same way and I think saber
would<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.799> done<00:01:26.009> better<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.520> more

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
would have done better with a more

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.580 
would have done better with a more
righteous<00:01:27.299> master<00:01:27.750> who<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.080> willing<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
righteous master who was willing to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.370 
righteous master who was willing to
yield<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.759> things<00:01:30.060> her<00:01:30.270> way<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.720> occasion

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
yield and do things her way on occasion

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.660 
yield and do things her way on occasion
of<00:01:31.590> course<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.280> she<00:01:32.520> had<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
of course it's not as if she had a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
of course it's not as if she had a
choice<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.180> who<00:01:33.689> she<00:01:33.960> would<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.200> summoned<00:01:34.590> five

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
choice of who she would be summoned five

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
choice of who she would be summoned five
but<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> seemed<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.520> every<00:01:35.790> time<00:01:36.000> she<00:01:36.240> tried

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
but it seemed like every time she tried

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
but it seemed like every time she tried
to<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> step<00:01:37.049> forward<00:01:37.110> Katie<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> do

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
to take a step forward Katie to do

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
to take a step forward Katie to do
everything<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.210> could<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> hold<00:01:39.869> her<00:01:40.020> back

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
everything he could to hold her back

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
everything he could to hold her back
both<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.040> were<00:01:41.189> fierce<00:01:41.520> competitors<00:01:42.119> in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
both of them were fierce competitors in

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.310 
both of them were fierce competitors in
their<00:01:42.390> own<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.020> they're<00:01:43.170> different

their own right but they're different
