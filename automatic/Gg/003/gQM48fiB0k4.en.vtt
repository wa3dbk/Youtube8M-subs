00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello people I hope you are very 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.810
 well the investigation let's talk about 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.440
 the second part of center hero 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.440
 commercial 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 It is very interesting as some people 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.099
 that your comedy actors do not fall 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.529
 well as adam sandler and jim who live 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.329
 tyler or kevin james but to me 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.669
 personally kevin james me hot 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.340
 more in likeable actor but in this 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.230
 movie as the power alpha would say 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.660
 rangers there is man 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 in this movie because because I already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 we had a first part in which 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 obviously maybe it is not the best tape 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.269
 of comedy much less the movie the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.039
 year but it could be entertaining or 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.170
 a fun proposal for some 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.449
 people but well it was good 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.519
 call us all to what follows of our 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 life but kevin james came back with this 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.050
 it's a part which maybe should never 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.999
 have existed because they do not propose us 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.960
 something really in this story where 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.790
 are going to count several heroes or 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 caregivers Security Police 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.440
 mall in a convention and 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 it turns out that there are evil evil people 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.100
 they want 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.650
 to mark in this convention whereby 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.660
 here is going to have to come to light these 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 heroes especially of course the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.680
 main character of kevin james and the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.830
 coast with this movie these characters 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.860
 they are extremely unilateral ie just 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.170
 They are good or they are bad 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.120
 they are not like us who are good and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 bad for life but they are good or 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.090
 bad and on the other hand there is a lot of abuse 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.270
 elgar or the engine that is to say was in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.700
 where you hit a broom or fall 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.860
 or you stumble very much in the style of the three 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.240
 nuts that one thing that even to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.030
 us of children now shorter of us 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.530
 it made the kids laugh today that only 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.140
 have notifications for candy 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 cross and things and those children no longer want 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.650
 see people hitting each other falling 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.780
 pounding like kevin james then 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.790
 it results in a very silly humor that to the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.290
 people no longer love it and the most thing the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.690
 movie is that it's only going to be like that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.580
 there is nothing else if the relationship that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.899
 suddenly has keith james with his daughter 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.360
 in the movie it's pretty cute 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.390
 pretty leg but then nothing beyond 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 to feel pretty for some time and if 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.650
 there is one other situation that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.570
 it genuinely makes us laugh but they are 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.239
 really very small situations very 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.220
 isolated and the others really that 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.420
 sometimes even one feels uncomfortable with 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.000
 what is happening in the movie 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.280
 because it's not funny but if I had a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 bad day and your purpose of life 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.580
 It is to remove all problems seeing 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.740
 kevin who is falling slip of 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.080
 roll hitting sticking and screwing 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.790
 in the head maybe not be so 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.560
 option but if you want to be a comedy 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.260
 smarter is definitely not 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.480
 It can be one of your tickets to enter 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.100
 to the cinema because it's a little wasted 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.800
 and that's why this tape gives me a 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.480
 delivery and average of 5 you must give 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.450
 how did you like this movie and what 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.550
 it's the worst comedy movie that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.750
 have seen and the worst movie they have 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.819
 seen leave the one that goes with in the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.560
