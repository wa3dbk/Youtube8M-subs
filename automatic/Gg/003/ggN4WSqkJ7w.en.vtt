00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.500
 in the 50s we could meet on the roads of Auvergne a 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.780
 front wheel drive with rear wheels with variable orientation 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 it was one of the first michael measurement cars 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.719
 thirty years later an assembly the tests continues 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.000
 the ladoux test center occupied 450 hectares north of Clermont-Ferrand 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.400
 on 40 kilometers of tracks every day of the year cars drive 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 continues 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.860
 it's not about winning a race 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.990
 but to go to the maximum of possibilities despite testing 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.990
 to their extreme limits 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.690
 but it's not just cars that adore 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.320
 there are also everyday cars 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.360
 yours 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.140
 who do what maybe 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 you will never do that to them 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 ap 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 sall 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.870
 it 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 it 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.690
 the goal 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.740
 let's leave the handling circuit to go to this plateau luisao

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.940
 the basalt coating tine finally the coefficient of adhesion that neighbor 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.940
 that of the ice 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.569
 measures the maximum speed at which the car maintains its 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.140
 trajectory and at the same time the tester tests the ease with which he 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
 catches the car when she picks up 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.980
 the reactions particular the different common 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.980
 different sculptures are very sensitive on wet ground 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.199
 in a tight bend 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.689
 the tests compared to speeds determined under conditions 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.629
 constant 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629

 breakthrough own qualities and these flying shots no longer affect the trajectory 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.719
 it's the redoubtable

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.359
 at a higher speed and without changing the position of the steering wheel 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.679
 the car continues online
