00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.030
 hey i think again and that comes 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.290
 today all donor version 1 as a stand 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.860
 Suitable for around when you can do this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.360
 ball by hand a mixed car want 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.590
 probably quite as grammatically 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.760
 but it does not matter 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 the mode of thun i was my believe 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.410
 that it is he who also makes the videos 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 if it is you then you could 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.140
 video do you like it already so falling 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 should look for the video 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:39.149
 but there are also 15,000 placeable 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 as object so the chines editor and yes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.980
 that's it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.079
 Now he is dark because he had 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.079
 really come to me faster 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 here will be photo mg dare park but what 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.250
 ever noticed is photo was mg 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.010
 disturbed 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.229
 no idea says obmann berg or something 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.210
 but he has to set aside 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.210
 legal but we hope so 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:18.820
 works balawi weidemann high valley 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.820
 So right left hall 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.960
 I just think that 's it 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.960
 board here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.500
 to run up we are now 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.500
 try 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.480
 those here 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.920
 office lotze 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.119
 how far 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.220
 the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.459
 that's what we have in there 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.480
 is actually already this practically 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.480
 Particles just like what has please 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.370
 the question there we did not release anything 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.070
 yes mr short fended 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.830
 to pour a nose 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:09.410
 so beautiful for us all 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 Of course, that's not the way it is now 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.150
 if I can do that 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.480
 mid- october will be sure a few times 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.780
 space 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.990
 better this way 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.990
 a lot of 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.740
 over ten years 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.099
 when stored for a very nice loose 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.040
 yes under pressure you could now synonymous 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.920
 still have to rein in high tours 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.920
 but for storage it does here 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.080
 no most vulnerable 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.080
 can roll wine served at the bottle 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.200
 Here is where a bit tight 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.330
 But it works 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.840
 Mr. was to evaluate 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.810
 The model is actually just cold 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.330
 savior and tree 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.330
 these errors 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:34.380
 but it would not fulfill its purpose 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.140
 probably not many 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:43.850
 So we make stuff and stuff so difficult 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.850
 that he has 5 and 5 points 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.810
 is probably due to real danger of the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.810
 a way was clear 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.050
 like architecture 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.860
 Yes 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.050
 Textures 5 and 5 points of functionality 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.620
 it would probably work too 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.970
 would look better if higher again 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:23.620
 feed mixer general times 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:27.669
 personal opinion is on of 5 and 5 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.660
 just awesome so unhappy that here 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:34.090
 could up here under normal position as 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.720
 It is also left in the description 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.820
 stock ball or straw and right at 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:47.260
 vale then nicely tune both rhine 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:50.250
 roll on the he overall rating then 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.780
 also five out of five stars 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.910
 do you want the left left? 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.910
 the description and yes would rather do 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.720
 if you are really thermal with that 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.050
 youtube channel 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.970
 could you really try it video 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.970
 to worry about how you built it here 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.020
 Thank you for the fashion as you 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.889
 find any mistakes or something 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.889
 well the lok 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:26.240
 well then already there looks the lok 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.240
 does not look that way 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:37.819
 a bit much going on a lot 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.819
 all with the valle donor 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:49.169
 therefore , no one gets here now 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:53.399
 full five points so only four so far 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:56.099
 makes the loose and nothing is that 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.659
 hanger gives or so but the four points 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:05.699
 average still better again 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:10.319
 So 4 points at the end and then until the 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:12.830
 next video downloaded in you and 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.830
 bye
