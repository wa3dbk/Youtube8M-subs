00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.789
 we look now she tells GS «500 coupe the St 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.660
 and you just have a closer look at the music functions 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.410
 we see here that is a radio there is now as a percentage 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 Chips keep selected 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.079
 and I can too 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.820
 here 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.070
 a complicity for the mp3 player converted to the process state crisis 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 had 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.220
 and percent 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.860
 Can you play my music directly? 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.190
 I can here will set the volume keys according to percentage mark 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 keep it going is quite good it is also loud loud 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.960
 set among others 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.000
 Of course I get over buttons like never before 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.370
 in My Music Player 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 so that you are all just postponed for current title all titles 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 Interpreters albums Schauers playlists and greens and random 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.140
 Do not just play on a title of the Americans 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.110
 to buy a title therefore appears in new delhi 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.460
 I can choose Armenia here next to current titles 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.530
 Add credentials to search 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 Percentage of property traffic is not possible around and then directly via Bluetooth Kiev 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 Do not want to move any more to a leadership duo 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.750
 choose 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 around memory status and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.800
 I do not want to scold anymore 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.430
 around 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.460
 exactly that was different 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.840
 to delete one 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.080
 Karl in the Speicherstadt what hides in the phone memory or 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 memory card 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.350
 There are generally light and sound effects 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.539
 So this is my coach, the spö not Stegner 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.980
 evaluate 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.720
 it can be awarded full star and asterisk 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 then I have to click here for a custom the user 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.670
 so moved by repeating a tooth and then getting it all out 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 and no compulsion is repeated 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.670
 and right next to it as well as the random playback of many with one 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.670
 to turn on and off kicking 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.249
 rightly do it 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:20.399
 German is also unanimous because it is always it is Künast but 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.520
 also in this way 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.399
 it is clear that they are raining here 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.099
 Quietly setting is the title of the whole problem 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.879
 I can also open the slider by turning right on the blue track to the bull 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.089
 I can always go here, too 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.459
 of course I can use my volume keys here for the next title 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.299
 jump clearly 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.489
 and we want to move here to Haiti 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.789
 See the possibilities I can minimize the claim 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.569
 during the interrogation the KSG can not write SMS between the legs 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.129
 i can leave with him a list of ads there is one i am lonely 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.159
 I can not just give our partners the predefined ones 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.359
 Prießnitz percent real 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.340
 more an alliance of who, then, a wedged steel 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.340
 Classical Jazz Pop Rock or concert halls 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.929
 So I can not hire myself 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.759
 To clarify exactly percent is to add use as percent spoke full throttle 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.759
 Turn on or cut out messages 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.809
 December we have buttocks here before and what I still quite nice finisher 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.129
 Sleep coach 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.930
 um, so that I can do more 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.460
 so if i can lull one to sleep for musician powers 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.720
 and for Alinghi, that could not happen all night 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 from a certain time go out then I can adjust this here 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:43.169
 in total from where of Claire I would have times and completely okay the phone 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.419
 plays various audio and video formats 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.489
 I think so 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.549
 the whole neat percentage e overall kept simple so that you 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.019
 between the equalizer 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.019
 no own percent can not make a setting 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:01.969
 but percent more just just so sometimes on the go listening to music then 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:03.909
 it is certainly well served by mobile phone
