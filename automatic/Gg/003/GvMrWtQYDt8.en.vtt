00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello again we continue our 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.099
 hard work we try to cure 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.870
 by our own efforts literally thousands of rubles 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.690
 holes through here on this I give Matiz 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 I do it because it is very sad 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 common phenomenon on deu on 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.350
 the Chinese and especially on our palms 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 which already 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.349
 the elderly spoke in the first part 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 video I repeat once again this is temporary 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 measure it is needed first to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.649
 you didn't drive a car that looks 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 like a scarecrow in the second that you understand 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.840
 what they do outbid and know where 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 to watch because I immediately say this is all 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 this story 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 now we have all this autumn 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.210
 the story after winter will look like 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 no better than she looked at 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.280
 the very beginning of the first video before 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.829
 we started to clean this now 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.020
 us and so we laid foam I wanted everything 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 take it off one day but the foam dries 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.119
 very long foam happens different here with us 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 some kind of debt drying caught in general 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.070
 she must dry answer from evening to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.259
 in the morning that's what happened with us now 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.259
 the remnants of the foam neatly cut off 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.710
 I cut out exactly neatly to 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.110
 do not pick off pieces of metal with a knife 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.030
 who are already breathing their last 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.630
 these came home yesterday and found myself 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.880
 in the hair tastes stiff foam and like me 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.780
 did not try 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.439
 Sorry, foam is not at all 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.360
 combed out and overall I had to or 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.640
 radish and a shred of hair further after 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.459
 how we groups cut it all away 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.659
 better spend a little more time not 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:04.490
 cut one by one so as not to submit 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.179
 knife metal is all the same we will 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.880
 peel off 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.679
 and here it is very superficial 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:17.299
 cleared quickly you will see 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:19.790
 and then after that we will bring it 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:25.519
 all in a decent view in order to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.890
 putty putty will continue all 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.380
 here do this trim tell you 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.780
 couple secret firstly sandpaper very 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
 convenient to wrap from the little bars because 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.390
 otherwise, how will you rub 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.690
 considered a cloth need some need 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.180
 yellow hard stop here and the second 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.829
 you can see the secret in this jar 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.389
 putty in it soaked two from putty 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.579
 small pieces that we 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.730
 will need to remove the residues 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.269
 putty soaked because then 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.319
 the skin is less clogged now her 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.480
 it is useless to mobilize 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.019
 foam removal but for putty it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.019
 will be good 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.400
 here we are finally finally yes putty 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.710
 I opened it I realized that it is absolutely not 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.530
 the most successful option I slipped my 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.260
 guys from the salon 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.510
 if you see this here it is 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.830
 homogeneous slightly granular need 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 that was putty slightly fibrous 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.380
 if you are in any auto shop ask 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.110
 you will be told what kind of putty it will be 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.570
 but explain the purpose and tell you what 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.570
 need not grainy fibrous his her 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.570
 will sell 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.680
 it costs about the same 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.050
 How much did I say at the beginning of the program 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.060
 further I add to the insight il 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.790
 neatly him 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.320
 stir it all smell terrible again I 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.110
 forgot respirator and now here 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.750
 the resulting mass neatly needs all 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:17.190
 stir in fact i still have pink 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.239
 seen now not visible 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.030
 it's a spatula and by the way here they go with 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.940
 we have banks at least 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.240
 walked and slowly begin this whole thing 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.470
 put it quietly it will be long 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.640
 a long process you put equal first 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.250
 it seems that it is impossible at all 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:45.150
 make normal exactly everything is possible 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.800
 just gently long and without haste we 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.750
 same as everyone in kindergarten 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.110
 plasticine figurines and loved this 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.110
 here she is 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.080
 Now we bring this whole thing under 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.349
 flat surface by the way here now i'm 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.539
 I realized that they have such big holes 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.210
 If I had another 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.380
 putty 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.199
 Here's a ball from the place and about which I 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.370
 said one might not even 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.190
 use foam 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.880
 back is worth using then when 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.039
 you right holes even stronger than to go well then 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.060
 there is when you need to create a cube inside 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:33.199
 will be structure 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:38.630
 and so now at this stage on the skin 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:40.849
 lip sanded helped eat will be able to go ahead 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.509
 see from times helped things go better 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.560
 our leader on the packaging is clogged up and so 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.789
 until smooth 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.690
 pleasant surface in which 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.150
 surface that you can then 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.449
 neatly pour paint and leaving 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.449
 clink 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.139
 on which for skin lay all around 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.300
 opened the door here don't forget to become 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:14.930
 open the door because otherwise the door 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.849
 paint and and quietly but patrick 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.280
 shell with pussy before that I'm good 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:27.789
 his chair is like that 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.789
 apply smooth paint movements 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.520
 In principle, theyâ€™re better off a little bit 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.460
 close 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.159
 because then the effect is obtained 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.020
 absentmindedness because see here i am 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.289
 there was too much stain here 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.289
 happened 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.629
 Well, something like this
