00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
poem because it's really just about how

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.550 
poem because it's really just about how
many<00:05:25.240> drink<00:05:25.510> water<00:05:27.480> it's<00:05:28.480> really<00:05:28.810> about<00:05:29.080> this

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
many drink water it's really about this

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.230

idea<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:31.200> that<00:05:32.200> there<00:05:32.950> is<00:05:33.160> no<00:05:33.190> sharing<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:34.090> what

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
idea of that there is no sharing of what

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.220 
idea of that there is no sharing of what
we<00:05:34.360> don't<00:05:34.570> already<00:05:34.720> know

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
we don't already know

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.770 
we don't already know
so<00:05:35.980> conferences<00:05:36.670> like<00:05:36.820> this<00:05:37.060> are<00:05:37.300> just<00:05:37.630> an

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
so conferences like this are just an

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.540 
so conferences like this are just an
opportunity<00:05:38.290> for<00:05:38.380> us<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.710> come<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:39.310> remember

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
opportunity for us to come and remember

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.820 
opportunity for us to come and remember
what<00:05:39.910> we've<00:05:40.060> forgotten<00:05:40.620> because<00:05:41.620> my

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
what we've forgotten because my

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.410 
what we've forgotten because my
experience<00:05:42.340> has<00:05:42.430> taught<00:05:42.610> me<00:05:42.670> that<00:05:43.000> everything

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
experience has taught me that everything

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.420 
experience has taught me that everything
we<00:05:43.750> need<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.140> know<00:05:44.350> is<00:05:44.590> already<00:05:44.950> within<00:05:45.130> us

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
we need to know is already within us

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.370 
we need to know is already within us
it's<00:05:45.670> a<00:05:45.790> part<00:05:46.030> of<00:05:46.210> everything<00:05:46.480> that<00:05:46.870> ever<00:05:46.990> has

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
it's a part of everything that ever has

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.440 
it's a part of everything that ever has
been<00:05:47.740> everything<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.640> is<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.090> everything

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
been everything that is and everything

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.030 
been everything that is and everything
that<00:05:49.570> we're<00:05:49.720> living<00:05:49.870> into<00:05:50.320> we<00:05:50.470> are<00:05:50.590> part<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:50.980> a

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
that we're living into we are part of a

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.150 
that we're living into we are part of a
continuum<00:05:51.730> and<00:05:51.910> so<00:05:52.540> knowledge<00:05:53.380> is<00:05:53.530> not<00:05:53.740> just

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
continuum and so knowledge is not just

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.760 
continuum and so knowledge is not just
belonging<00:05:54.520> to<00:05:54.880> one<00:05:55.120> specific<00:05:55.780> person<00:05:56.020> but

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
belonging to one specific person but

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.590 
belonging to one specific person but
rather<00:05:56.950> it's<00:05:57.280> always<00:05:57.700> there<00:05:57.910> for<00:05:57.940> all<00:05:58.270> of<00:05:58.480> us

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
rather it's always there for all of us

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.630 
rather it's always there for all of us
but<00:05:58.750> what<00:05:58.930> has<00:05:59.020> happened<00:05:59.230> over<00:05:59.650> time<00:06:00.310> as<00:06:00.520> we've

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
but what has happened over time as we've

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.000 
but what has happened over time as we've
built<00:06:00.850> up<00:06:01.000> blocks<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:02.080> that<00:06:02.260> knowing<00:06:02.830> and

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
built up blocks to that knowing and

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.070 
built up blocks to that knowing and
that's<00:06:03.670> part<00:06:03.940> of<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.090> gift<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.450> yoga<00:06:04.810> that<00:06:04.840> it

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
that's part of the gift of yoga that it

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.890 
that's part of the gift of yoga that it
helps<00:06:05.410> us<00:06:05.620> uncover<00:06:06.550> those<00:06:06.880> blocks<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:07.630> with

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
through those blocks to open up to our

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.930 
through those blocks to open up to our
inner<00:06:13.930> awareness<00:06:14.830> that's<00:06:14.980> always<00:06:15.460> been<00:06:15.730> there

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
inner awareness that's always been there
