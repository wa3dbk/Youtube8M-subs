00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
took the all newly released half-life 2

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.759 
took the all newly released half-life 2
madham<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> was<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.330> released<00:00:09.570> today<00:00:09.809> music

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
is the half-life 2's source engine and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.630 
is the half-life 2's source engine and
basically<00:00:14.099> um<00:00:14.750> very<00:00:16.279> creative<00:00:17.279> group<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
basically um very creative group of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090 
basically um very creative group of
developers<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.300> together<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.020> well<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.920> guess

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
developers got together and well I guess

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830

you<00:00:20.189> can't<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.400> say<00:00:20.670> creative<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
you can't really say creative but the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.939 
you can't really say creative but the
object<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.289> they're<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.890> to

map that out to the left trigger and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.830 
map that out to the left trigger and
other<00:01:29.220> than<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.880> seems<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.689> work<00:01:30.810> quite

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
other than that it seems to work quite

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
other than that it seems to work quite
fine<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.740> swap<00:01:32.070> through<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> weapons

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

steam client and any source game if you
I<00:01:48.689> mean<00:01:48.780> any<00:01:49.500> scheme<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.030> made<00:01:51.210> by

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
I mean any scheme so if it's made by

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.490 
I mean any scheme so if it's made by
valve<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.640> half-life<00:01:53.640> 2<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.060> later<00:01:54.500> then

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
valve and it's half-life 2 or later then

named a top of the liabilities and this
is<00:02:26.819> 640<00:02:27.360> 480<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.290> lagged<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.739> bit

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
is 640 480 is because it lagged a bit

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.059 
is 640 480 is because it lagged a bit
