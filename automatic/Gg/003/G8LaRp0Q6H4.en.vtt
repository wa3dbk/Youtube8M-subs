 city ​​goes to the river clyde the small 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.250
 hilarious because the subway is super 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.380
 healthy without balloons for people who 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.120
 they are dumb constant change is very useful 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.120
 to meter long and easy 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.900
 It is very easy because if this stop happens 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 you are not getting above two 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.310

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.940
 the meters of nothing 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.370
 really the center of the trait is the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.870
 coolest subway in which they are 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.119
 otan you do not have meters look at the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.899
 Barcelona 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.899
 from madrid 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.219
 the fact is that the glasgow subway 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:20.180
 there is also the future of the keys that 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.080
 of the future but before 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.489

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.550
 of buying the ticket from a person and 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.360

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.010
 If I am I, prepare yourself to buy the day of 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.240
 everything a person is sometimes that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.580
 a machine so subject that in humanity 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.970
 it is not very recorded at the fantastic moment 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.970

 Automatically announced stops 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.090

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.120

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:31.470
