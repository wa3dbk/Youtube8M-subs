00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.870
 present a high-end smartphone from 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.919
 at zte summers the rank s 2 4 g 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 smartphones which may well please 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.260
 number to its 4g connectivity 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.789
 French so first I showed 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.019
 of devices so with a battery 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:29.439
 removable a location this micro sim a 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:30.820
 micro sd slot so already the same 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.990
 for the first good point was a little 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.030
 withdrawn 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.079
 the back shell which is rather rare 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.090
 on high-end smartphones in 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.550
 general 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.350
 then for the return of the device on 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.260
 the left slice nothing down a microphone 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.579
 as well as a location for the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.440
 loading and connect us to your pc 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.800
 on the right slice the button 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.010
 volume and the ignition button and on the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 on top of a moving jack that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.359
 would wiggle to your earphones not 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.260
 on the front 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.260
 the usual buttons back menu and by 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:19.120
 m knowing that common who are 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.860
 backlit by a little bit of me first 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.440
 thing we notice an overlay the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.040
 manufacturer it is there even on blow I 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.360
 were saying in the star theme you are a 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.060
 name that was released last month 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.240
 smartphone offering on frandroid but 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 much more affordable my little 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.400
 overlay with as usual the menu 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.290
 just a few different icons otherwise 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.820
 we find some small 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.070
 specificities that will allow you 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.110
 improve ergonomics 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.670
 knowing that my personal as me 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.290
 I would have preferred a kind that I 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.150
 overcoat production preference and so 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.280
 I would prefer treatment would be getting 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.540
 restore and take for example the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.750
 peace 'launcher that will allow you 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.649
 to have a god android experience so 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.259
 at the level of the whole where we are on a 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.980
 phone that with a processor 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.020
 snapdragon of 801 so what's made of 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.910
 better now what allows you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.319
 to have a score of over 33000 points 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.830
 if we compare a little bit with the 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.440
 competition 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.290
 we see how level of a wins at 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.560
 miami 3 over a g2 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.720
 so it's still very good 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.250
 very good performance 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.100
 I can you and snapdragon processor 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.510
 801 with a full HD screen a camera 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.870
 rear 13 megapixel 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.450
 andrÃ© 4.3 so really what he knows of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.709
 who's doing better now and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.420
 so giga of ram with 16 giga of 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.569
 internal memory at the level of the gps I you 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.720
 did a screenshot that he talked about 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:05.000
 itself so a detection have almost 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.870
 10 seconds but an incredible man 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 of satellites 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.630
 I said I do not think I have 1st 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.500
 smartphone currently on the market 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.690
 who was capturing so many 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.140
 dates and the different ones so still a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.500
 time a very good point for this zte who 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.739
 offers a screen like a good quality 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.829
 a full hd screen so that's fine 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.140
 for for your everyday use knowing 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.359
 that he does like 5 inches 5 so for 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.269
 a multimedia vision that risks being 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:43.880
 rather not bad so I show a little 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.790
 little settings so again 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.470
 a little retouched by zte have nothing 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.750
 of 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.890
 nothing too general nothing too much 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.880
 custom still repeating enough 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.790
 close to what is usually done 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.050
 to control so as you said all 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.670
 on time it is good 4g you see here 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.890
 I tried to put a sim card such 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.300
 in unfortunately the city in 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.060
 which I find myself not covered 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.860
 by the 4g so it's a license what it 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.280
 gave me a ski test around 25 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.209
 mega 30 mega but no steps from calais 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.570
 in my case so otherwise we find the 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.910
 things 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.730
 all the usual parameters with 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.680
 some small originalities like the 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.020
 children's fashion with and I think 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.780
 introduced by the galaxy s 5 1 which allows 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.060
 to leave your parental smartphone 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.400
 to children without leaving their face 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.740
 full of the phone so a lot of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.290
 little things like that nice a month of 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.730
 energy saving or that too which 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.370
 can be quite practical even if they 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.630
 will ride more on the playsport 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.030
 but all thoroughly that it's like 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.890
 good ideas from zte for 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.260
 propose the best smartphone possible 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.700
 in a budget of less than 400 euros which 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.940
 proposes the best performances of 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.930
 moment with 4g compatibility 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.590
 So all for much cheaper 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.419
 than the usual tenors I 'm going to 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.250
 show you the storage and languages 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.770
 and I note however only one round of 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.970
 the device 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.970
 then stop cage so 16 giga total 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:22.680
 so as usual divided into 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:27.719
 several spaces for languages so 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.919
 no the 100% French offers because 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.620
 it's a smartphone that is not 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.150
 depressed normally so we have 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.029
 returns as usual we will put it 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.400
 that you want French well and 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:42.150
 so with all google services so 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.159
 the playsport that works perfectly 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.449
 for France 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.349
 so that was a quick 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.789
 presentation of the big two s 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.430
 5- inch 5 high-end smartphones 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.360
 with a stand ragon 801 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.110
 proposed to less than 400 euros in the 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.599
 android shop 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.219
 so I invite you to go see him if he 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.060
 you are interested and I tell you see you soon 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.060
 for a next video
