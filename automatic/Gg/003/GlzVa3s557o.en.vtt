I<00:00:51.030> would<00:00:51.359> only<00:00:51.600> advise<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.499> this<00:00:52.649> on

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
I would only advise you use this on

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
I would only advise you use this on
static<00:00:53.429> objects<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.329> other<00:00:54.539> words<00:00:54.870> anything

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
static objects in other words anything

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.829 
static objects in other words anything
that<00:00:55.679> doesn't<00:00:56.129> move<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.239> imagine<00:00:57.359> if

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
that doesn't move as you can imagine if

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.599 
that doesn't move as you can imagine if
using<00:00:58.229> this<00:00:58.319> gooseneck<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> moving<00:00:59.429> object

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
using this gooseneck on a moving object

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
using this gooseneck on a moving object
due<00:01:00.179> to<00:01:00.329> its<00:01:00.479> lack<00:01:00.659> of<00:01:00.839> stability<00:01:01.019> it<00:01:01.469> will

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
due to its lack of stability it will

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.100 
due to its lack of stability it will
shake<00:01:02.249> around<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.969> vibrate<00:01:03.449> meaning<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
shake around and vibrate meaning you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
shake around and vibrate meaning you
won't<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.500> left<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:04.949> stable<00:01:05.820> footage

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
won't be left with very stable footage

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
won't be left with very stable footage
so<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.009> left<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.399> two

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
so all in all we are left with two

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
so all in all we are left with two
