00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
had this kind of thing but it definitely

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
had this kind of thing but it definitely
didn't<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.720> they

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
didn't look like this it actually they

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.170 
didn't look like this it actually they
changed<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.670> started<00:01:45.000> falling

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
changed it because they started falling

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
changed it because they started falling
off<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.810> could<00:01:46.290> never<00:01:46.439> fall<00:01:46.710> off<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.130> like

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
off this could never fall off is like

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
off this could never fall off is like
all<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.970> piece<00:01:50.420> there<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.720> silver

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
all one piece there and this silver

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.940 
all one piece there and this silver
piece<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.920> guess<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.549> looks<00:01:53.790> okay<00:01:54.470> not<00:01:55.470> much<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
piece I guess it looks okay not much you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
piece I guess it looks okay not much you
can<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> circles<00:01:56.790> go<00:01:56.939> right<00:01:57.149> through<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.570> in

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
can the circles go right through like in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.100 
can the circles go right through like in
the<00:01:57.899> authentic<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the authentic and then you have the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010 
the authentic and then you have the
bronze<00:02:01.350> piece<00:02:01.969> which<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.119> guess<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
bronze piece which I guess it kind of

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.469 
bronze piece which I guess it kind of
looks<00:02:04.290> okay<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.430> did<00:02:05.610> notice<00:02:05.850> though<00:02:06.270> in

separated<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.030> way<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
separated it's not that way in the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.790 
separated it's not that way in the
authentic<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.599> has<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.500> that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
authentic and then it has you know that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.030 
authentic and then it has you know that
piece<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:24.180> she<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.629> one<00:02:24.780> feet<00:02:25.019> on<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
piece that she was the one feet on and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.729 
piece that she was the one feet on and
the<00:02:26.160> two<00:02:26.370> little<00:02:26.459> bumps<00:02:26.879> on<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.180> side<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:28.620> does

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
the two little bumps on the side it does

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.339 
the two little bumps on the side it does
not<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> little<00:02:29.450> date<00:02:30.450> tag<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.900> guess<00:02:31.110> like

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
not have a little date tag I guess like

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.520 
not have a little date tag I guess like
any<00:02:31.769> cast<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> guess<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.540> kind<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.810> sounds<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
any cast but I guess it kind of sounds a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.729 
any cast but I guess it kind of sounds a
little<00:02:34.650> off<00:02:34.800> fennekin<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.870> looks<00:02:37.200> okay<00:02:37.709> but

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
little off fennekin it looks okay but

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.850 
little off fennekin it looks okay but
like<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.300> links<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.470> bothered<00:02:40.830> me

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
like this the links kind of bothered me

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.070 
like this the links kind of bothered me
I<00:02:41.190> couldn't<00:02:42.180> put<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.599> my<00:02:42.750> authentic<00:02:43.200> bag

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
I couldn't put this on my authentic bag

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.680 
I couldn't put this on my authentic bag
because<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.459> obvious<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.420> fake

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
because it's just obvious that it's fake

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.110 
because it's just obvious that it's fake
alright<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.830> now<00:02:50.010> let's<00:02:50.040> move<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
alright so now let's move on to the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.380 
alright so now let's move on to the
authentic<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:52.489> said<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:53.700> thought<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> came<00:02:54.239> in

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
authentic I said your thought it came in

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.940 
authentic I said your thought it came in
this<00:02:54.569> box<00:02:59.660> it's<00:03:00.660> also<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.019> lot<00:03:01.200> lighter<00:03:01.530> than

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
this box it's also a lot lighter than

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.509 
this box it's also a lot lighter than
the<00:03:02.489> replica<00:03:03.349> no<00:03:04.349> bleeding<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.250> course

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
the replica no bleeding and of course

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.190 
the replica no bleeding and of course
the<00:03:06.239> ink<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.000> quality<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.599> metal<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the ink so the quality of the metal is a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.089 
the ink so the quality of the metal is a
lot<00:03:13.500> better<00:03:13.819> obviously<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.860> see

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
lot better obviously and you can see

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:24.319 
lot better obviously and you can see
again<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:21.260> see<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.670> newer<00:03:23.880> one<00:03:24.180> at

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
again the see this is the newer one at

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.050 
again the see this is the newer one at
least<00:03:24.680> smooth<00:03:25.680> they<00:03:26.190> took<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.790> little

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
least smooth they took out the little

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.699 
least smooth they took out the little
balls<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.389> used<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.260> because<00:03:28.560> like

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
balls that used to be in it because like

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.860 
balls that used to be in it because like
I<00:03:28.859> said<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.190> kept<00:03:29.370> falling<00:03:29.790> out<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.720> can

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
I said it kept falling out but you can

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.800 
I said it kept falling out but you can
see<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.139> difference<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.609> metal<00:03:32.970> it's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
see the difference in the metal it's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.400 
see the difference in the metal it's
like<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:35.010> know<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.819> lot<00:03:36.060> shinier<00:03:36.510> if

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
like you know this is a lot shinier if

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.770 
like you know this is a lot shinier if
you<00:03:37.620> look<00:03:37.829> at<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.790> definitely<00:03:39.269> see

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
you look at it you can definitely see

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.270 
you look at it you can definitely see
the<00:03:39.810> difference<00:03:39.930> there<00:03:41.450> then<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.989> have<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the difference there then you have the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.449 
the difference there then you have the
silver<00:03:44.549> piece<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:46.650> you're<00:03:46.829> going<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:47.250> come

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
silver piece that you're going to come

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.280 
silver piece that you're going to come
clear<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.299> can<00:03:48.450> see<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.720> difference<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
clear you can see the difference in the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
clear you can see the difference in the
metal<00:03:49.590> how<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.799> loot<00:03:50.220> saw<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.700> lot<00:03:51.359> shining<00:03:53.090> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
metal how the loot saw a lot shining the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.090 
metal how the loot saw a lot shining the
metal<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> lot<00:03:54.780> shinier<00:03:55.290> than<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.889> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
metal is a lot shinier than that of the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.660 
metal is a lot shinier than that of the
air<00:03:56.810> replica<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:59.810> you<00:04:00.810> have<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.670> bronze

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
air replica then you have the bronze

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750 
air replica then you have the bronze
piece<00:04:03.209> here<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.319> is<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.650> authentic<00:04:05.099> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
piece here this is the authentic and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.809 
piece here this is the authentic and
this<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.480> replica<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.200> guess<00:04:08.040> not<00:04:08.310> too<00:04:08.579> too

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
this is the replica I guess not too too

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.400 
this is the replica I guess not too too
much<00:04:09.000> but<00:04:09.180> again<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.630> shine<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
much but again the shine on the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.050 
much but again the shine on the
authentic<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:12.599> lot<00:04:13.410> more<00:04:13.980> than<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.849> of<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
authentic is a lot more than that of the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.270 
authentic is a lot more than that of the
replica<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.910> overtime<00:04:18.769> sign<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.070> replica

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
replica the overtime sign on the replica

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.280 
replica the overtime sign on the replica
on<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.880> authentic<00:04:21.479> here<00:04:24.200> compared<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.700> that

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
on the authentic here compared to that

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.170 
on the authentic here compared to that
of<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:28.780> replica<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.400> guess<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:31.580> pretty<00:04:31.790> close

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
of the replica I guess it's pretty close

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.530 
of the replica I guess it's pretty close
but<00:04:32.600> again<00:04:33.380> that's<00:04:33.590> shine<00:04:33.980> on<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.090> authentic

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
but again that's shine on the authentic

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.770 
but again that's shine on the authentic
is<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:36.230> lot<00:04:37.160> more<00:04:37.340> believable<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:41.450> it<00:04:41.540> looks

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
is a lot more believable but it looks

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:51.240 
is a lot more believable but it looks
pretty<00:04:42.440> close<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:43.130> would<00:04:43.880> have<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.210> say<00:04:44.420> myself

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.860 

authentic<00:04:52.600> replica<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:56.120> course<00:04:56.450> the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
authentic replica and of course the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.080 
authentic replica and of course the
authentic<00:04:57.380> cast<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.800> little<00:04:58.100> tag<00:04:58.400> like<00:04:58.880> with

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
authentic cast a little tag like with

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.110 
authentic cast a little tag like with
the<00:04:59.240> date<00:04:59.450> code<00:04:59.780> or<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.020> stamp<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.120> that

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the date code or that stamp on it that

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:14.200 
the date code or that stamp on it that
tells<00:05:02.450> you<00:05:02.690> it's<00:05:02.870> authentic<00:05:04.600> okay<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.940> sound

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
tells you it's authentic okay the sound

and<00:05:48.230> like<00:05:48.950> I<00:05:49.070> mentioned<00:05:49.130> before<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:50.030> links

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
and like I mentioned before the links

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.700 
and like I mentioned before the links
you<00:05:53.150> do<00:05:53.360> have<00:05:53.570> some<00:05:53.870> breakage<00:05:54.380> in<00:05:54.590> the

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
you do have some breakage in the

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.580 
you do have some breakage in the
authentic<00:05:55.160> like<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:56.390> know<00:05:56.510> it's<00:05:57.320> not<00:05:57.470> a

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
authentic like you know it's not a

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.110 
authentic like you know it's not a
complete<00:05:57.980> circle<00:05:58.370> but<00:05:58.520> it's<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:58.700> lot<00:05:58.850> neater

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
complete circle but it's a lot neater

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.200 
complete circle but it's a lot neater
than<00:05:59.540> the<00:06:00.410> replica<00:06:02.680> as<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:03.890> can<00:06:04.100> see<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:05.090> I'll

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
than the replica as you can see and I'll

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.130 
than the replica as you can see and I'll
show<00:06:05.450> you<00:06:05.480> again<00:06:05.900> do<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:07.010> replica<00:06:08.020> see<00:06:09.020> the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
show you again do the replica see the

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:17.170 
show you again do the replica see the
difference<00:06:09.910> it's<00:06:10.910> like<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:12.760> lot<00:06:13.760> Messier<00:06:16.180> then

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
difference it's like a lot Messier then

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.420 
difference it's like a lot Messier then
it<00:06:17.300> is<00:06:19.210> but<00:06:20.210> I<00:06:20.480> guess<00:06:20.510> it's<00:06:21.020> a<00:06:21.440> matter<00:06:22.280> of

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
it is but I guess it's a matter of

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.380 
it is but I guess it's a matter of
preference

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
preference

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:30.570 
preference
again<00:06:25.630> authentic<00:06:27.370> replica<00:06:28.510> it<00:06:29.510> depends<00:06:29.930> on

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
again authentic replica it depends on

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.680 
again authentic replica it depends on
what's<00:06:31.580> important<00:06:32.150> to<00:06:32.270> you

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
I really like the authentic a lot better

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.280 
I really like the authentic a lot better
