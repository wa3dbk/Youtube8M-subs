00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.030
 Welcome to the "World of Warcraft" professional crash course: combat thief 

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:06.824
 In the film, we will be in a simple and clear way 

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:10.902
 Tell you how to get started with a 90-level combat thief 

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:15.840
 The two main resources of thieves are energy and combo points. 

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:18.404
 Energy will rise rapidly over time 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.834
 Mainly used to perform several basic skills 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.411
 To accumulate combo points 

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.183
 The combo points will accumulate on the target. 

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:28.680
 Can be used to launch powerful finishing techniques 

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:32.594
 Apply deadly poison before entering the battle 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.739
 After entering the battle, the combat thief will use energy on two main skills. 

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.418
 The most important of these is the evil attack. 

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:42.869
 Evil attacks can cause considerable damage and generate combo points 

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:46.081
 You can also cast a blow to the bottom and apply a debuff to the target. 

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:48.633
 Not only can you make your finishing skills better 

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:52.779
 It also gives the evil attack a chance to generate additional combo points. 

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:55.396
 This debuff effect is best able to stay on the target 

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.667
 Only when the effect is about to disappear, it is necessary to cast a blow 

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:00.661
 When you accumulate 5 combo points 

00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:02.958
 There are three main ways to use 

00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:07.284
 Cutting can provide a gain effect that dramatically increases your attack speed 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.413
 So try to maintain the effect of resident 

00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:12.710
 You can also use combo points to cast deboning 

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:16.889
 Causes a lot of damage, or initiates recharge and recharge, which is a continuous treatment effect. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.728
 Can help you save your life 

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:21.845
 If you want to master the thieves' gameplay, there are still many places worth exploring. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 I hope this introduction can give you basic ideas and the right direction. 

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:29.840
 As long as you master the basic concepts, take a moment to study 

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:32.892
 Spellbook, talent and glyph 

00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:36.161
 Exploring spells not mentioned here will help a lot. 

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.100
 Thank you for watching, we see you in Azeroth!
