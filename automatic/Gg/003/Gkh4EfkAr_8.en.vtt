00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
serious i would say that we really

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.550 
serious i would say that we really
started<00:01:52.520> having<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.380> infestations<00:01:54.380> that

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
started having you the infestations that

started having you the infestations that
we're<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:55.580> starting<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.680> probably<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.920> 70s

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
we're just starting and probably the 70s

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.160 
we're just starting and probably the 70s
and<00:01:58.700> since<00:01:59.000> then<00:01:59.240> they<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.630> keep<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.080> know

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
and since then they just keep you know

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440 
and since then they just keep you know
just<00:02:00.350> keeps<00:02:00.590> multiplying<00:02:00.950> because<00:02:01.730> we

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
just keeps multiplying because we

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.290 
just keeps multiplying because we
haven't<00:02:02.810> had<00:02:02.990> any<00:02:03.020> way<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> control<00:02:04.460> them<00:02:04.640> it

seems<00:02:05.540> like<00:02:05.780> they're<00:02:05.990> more<00:02:06.170> active<00:02:06.350> right

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
seems like they're more active right

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.639

back in the 30s its natural enemy stayed
behind<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> ant<00:03:20.180> was<00:03:20.480> free<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.140> spread<00:03:21.500> for

he was bringing his infected ants back
to<00:03:47.720> Charles<00:03:48.140> frisch's<00:03:48.560> ranch<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.820> within<00:03:50.000> a

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
to Charles frisch's ranch so within a

couple of weeks you know several

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.520 
couple of weeks you know several
thousand<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.210> these<00:03:53.300> ants<00:03:53.780> will<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.290> died

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
thousand of these ants will have died

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.260 
thousand of these ants will have died
the<00:03:54.920> flies<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.190> are<00:03:55.400> inside<00:03:55.730> will<00:03:55.910> come<00:03:56.120> out

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
the flies that are inside will come out

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.870 
the flies that are inside will come out
of<00:03:56.360> their<00:03:56.480> hand<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:57.080> right<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.880> start

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
of their hand that's right and start

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.120 
of their hand that's right and start
attacking<00:03:59.000> other<00:03:59.570> ants<00:03:59.930> yes<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.980> we'll

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
attacking other ants yes so so we'll

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.880 
attacking other ants yes so so we'll
have<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> pulse<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:02.170> flies<00:04:03.170> coming<00:04:03.650> into<00:04:03.800> the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
have a pulse of flies coming into the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.070 
have a pulse of flies coming into the
environment<00:04:04.130> probably<00:04:04.880> about<00:04:05.120> two<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.050> three

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080

weeks<00:04:06.290> from<00:04:06.680> now<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:08.120> order<00:04:08.300> to<00:04:08.480> get<00:04:08.660> an

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
weeks from now and in order to get an

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.170 
weeks from now and in order to get an
establishment<00:04:09.500> going<00:04:09.770> in<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.010> area<00:04:10.400> what<00:04:10.940> we

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
establishment going in this area what we

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.010 
establishment going in this area what we
are<00:04:12.140> going<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.530> do<00:04:12.800> is<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:13.090> multiple<00:04:14.090> wave<00:04:14.660> of

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
are going to do is a multiple wave of

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.740 
are going to do is a multiple wave of
releases<00:04:15.830> so<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.310> we<00:04:16.459> have<00:04:16.669> these<00:04:17.090> pulses<00:04:17.600> of

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
releases so that we have these pulses of

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.110 
releases so that we have these pulses of
emerging<00:04:18.200> flies<00:04:18.500> supported<00:04:19.400> by<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:19.580> next<00:04:19.850> one

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
emerging flies supported by the next one

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.210 
emerging flies supported by the next one
another<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.660> week<00:04:20.900> later<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.410> another<00:04:21.980> week

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
another a week later and another week

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010 
another a week later and another week
later<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.030> we<00:04:23.150> get<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.360> continuous

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020
