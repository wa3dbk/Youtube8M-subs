00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
images your background because it's a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.929 
images your background because it's a
gradient<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:22.949> dark<00:00:23.160> gray<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.670> light

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
gradient go from dark gray to a light

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.480 
gradient go from dark gray to a light
gray<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> color<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.220> footer

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
gray as well as the color for the footer

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.580 
gray as well as the color for the footer
so<00:00:27.210> let's<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.019> started

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
so let's get started

so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.970 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
the<00:00:31.539> main<00:00:31.990> background<00:00:32.259> so<00:00:32.649> that<00:00:32.680> was<00:00:32.860> that

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
the main background so that was that

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.400 
the main background so that was that
really<00:00:33.309> dark<00:00:33.489> gray<00:00:33.820> which<00:00:34.390> is<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.899> color<00:00:35.230> we

set to the body so we need to go to our

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.140 
set to the body so we need to go to our
CSS<00:00:38.140> Styles<00:00:38.620> find<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.190> body<00:00:39.400> one<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:39.879> double

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
CSS Styles find the body one and double

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.819 
CSS Styles find the body one and double
click<00:00:40.300> it<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.660> now<00:00:41.170> we<00:00:41.350> need<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.590> go<00:00:41.770> to

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
click it and now we need to go to

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.369 
click it and now we need to go to
background<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.600> says<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.870> change<00:00:44.110> color

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
background and it says to change color

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.610

we're<00:00:44.980> going<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.340> select<00:00:45.640> color<00:00:45.970> so<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:47.530> I'm

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
we're going to select color so well I'm

we're going to select color so well I'm
going<00:00:47.769> to<00:00:47.800> choose<00:00:48.010> 3<00:00:48.309> 3<00:00:48.610> 3<00:00:48.790> which<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.210> nice

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
going to choose 3 3 3 which is a nice

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.619 
going to choose 3 3 3 which is a nice
dark<00:00:49.720> gray<00:00:50.019> click<00:00:50.800> apart<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:52.089> applies<00:00:52.390> it

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
dark gray click apart and it applies it

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.110 
dark gray click apart and it applies it
to<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.900> whole<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> background<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.220> you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
to the whole of the background and you

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.819 
to the whole of the background and you
can<00:00:55.390> obviously<00:00:55.629> darker<00:00:56.260> because<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.710> haven't

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
can obviously darker because we haven't

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.110 
can obviously darker because we haven't
set<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.100> background<00:00:57.339> for<00:00:57.640> this<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:57.970> it's

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
set a background for this so it's

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.220 
set a background for this so it's
see-through<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:58.659> it<00:00:58.780> goes<00:00:58.900> straight<00:00:59.050> through

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
see-through and it goes straight through

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.680 
see-through and it goes straight through
to<00:00:59.559> this<00:00:59.680> background<00:00:59.920> as<00:01:00.370> well<00:01:00.550> as<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.699> 30<00:01:01.000> so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
to this background as well as the 30 so

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.020 
to this background as well as the 30 so
that's<00:01:01.869> the<00:01:02.110> body<00:01:02.440> done

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
that's the body done

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.200 
that's the body done
so<00:01:04.839> now<00:01:05.050> for<00:01:05.110> my<00:01:05.350> main<00:01:05.890> background<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.760> that<00:01:06.790> is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
so now for my main background so that is

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.100 
so now for my main background so that is
this<00:01:07.630> bit<00:01:07.870> here<00:01:08.610> I've<00:01:09.610> got<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.090> gradient<00:01:10.720> here

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
this bit here I've got a gradient here

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.560 
this bit here I've got a gradient here
which<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.800> sized<00:01:14.280> width<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.430> 960<00:01:15.640> sets<00:01:16.420> our

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
which is sized width of 960 sets our

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.420 
which is sized width of 960 sets our
wide<00:01:16.810> our<00:01:17.050> content<00:01:17.530> thinkers<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:18.190> height

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
wide our content thinkers and in height

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.880 
wide our content thinkers and in height
of<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.670> 10<00:01:18.880> now<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.479> put<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:19.960> height<00:01:20.110> as<00:01:20.290> 10<00:01:20.530> is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
of a 10 now I put the height as 10 is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.010 
of a 10 now I put the height as 10 is
because<00:01:21.310> if<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.520> had<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.790> like<00:01:22.210> site<00:01:22.900> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
because if you had it to like site the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.330 
because if you had it to like site the
size<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.440> screen<00:01:23.710> or<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.920> size<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.250> a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
size of the screen or the size of a

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.000 
size of the screen or the size of a
thing<00:01:24.580> exactly<00:01:24.910> then<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:26.200> will<00:01:26.619> be<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> master

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
thing exactly then we will be a master

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.130 
thing exactly then we will be a master
size<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.610> be<00:01:27.760> hard<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.180> blood<00:01:28.450> server<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
size and be hard to blood server and

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.780 
size and be hard to blood server and
plus<00:01:29.650> we<00:01:29.800> can<00:01:29.979> repeat<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.460> which<00:01:30.580> I'll<00:01:30.700> be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
plus we can repeat it which I'll be

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.460 
plus we can repeat it which I'll be
showing<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.060> later<00:01:31.240> but<00:01:31.900> basically<00:01:32.229> it's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
showing you later but basically it's

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.870 
showing you later but basically it's
just<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.710> gradient<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.190> public<00:01:33.460> can't<00:01:33.640> see<00:01:33.700> it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
just a gradient you public can't see it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.690 
just a gradient you public can't see it
well<00:01:34.060> but<00:01:34.960> basically<00:01:35.500> here<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.190> starts<00:01:36.550> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
well but basically here it starts a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.090 
well but basically here it starts a
lightest<00:01:37.180> gray<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.600> here<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.380> finishes<00:01:38.950> as

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
lightest gray and here it finishes as

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.450 
lightest gray and here it finishes as
white<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:39.970> completely<00:01:40.660> white<00:01:40.899> 0<00:01:41.170> 0<00:01:41.530> 0<00:01:41.770> 0<00:01:41.830> 0

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
white so completely white 0 0 0 0 0

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060 
white so completely white 0 0 0 0 0
hashtag<00:01:43.030> white<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:44.590> that's<00:01:44.680> our<00:01:44.890> background

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
hashtag white so that's our background

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.430 
hashtag white so that's our background
and<00:01:45.700> we<00:01:45.880> put<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.149> inside<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.899> images

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
and we put it inside of the images

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.420 
and we put it inside of the images

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
you can see it's applied itself but

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.870 
you can see it's applied itself but
sometimes<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.890> internet<00:02:15.370> won't<00:02:15.550> breed<00:02:15.730> this

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
sometimes the internet won't breed this

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.730 
sometimes the internet won't breed this
properly<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.360> what<00:02:16.570> we<00:02:16.660> need<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.930> keep<00:02:17.200> go<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
properly so what we need to keep go to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.590 
properly so what we need to keep go to
background<00:02:18.280> repeat'<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.760> put<00:02:19.209> wrap<00:02:19.420> and

background repeat' and put wrap and
repeat<00:02:19.870> repeat<00:02:20.290> why<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.670> repeats<00:02:21.970> it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
like that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.710 
like that
if<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.990> put<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.320> as<00:02:23.620> X<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:25.150> won't<00:02:25.420> repeat

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
if we put this as X it won't repeat

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.110 
if we put this as X it won't repeat
properly<00:02:26.050> or<00:02:26.140> repeat<00:02:26.470> down<00:02:26.890> or<00:02:27.250> pre<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.790> quat

properly or repeat down or pre a quat
across<00:02:28.570> but<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.290> already<00:02:29.620> filled

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800

the<00:02:29.920> hole<00:02:30.130> across<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.580> won't<00:02:30.760> repeat<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the hole across it won't repeat it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.910 
the hole across it won't repeat it
anymore<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.900> won't<00:02:32.050> repeat<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:32.380> downwards
