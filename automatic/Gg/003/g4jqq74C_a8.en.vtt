something moving moving an animal moving
round<00:00:36.070> how<00:00:36.850> much<00:00:37.059> preparation<00:00:37.750> goes<00:00:38.260> into

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
round how much preparation goes into

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.130 
round how much preparation goes into
sort<00:00:38.830> of<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.010> choreography<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.420> music

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
sort of the choreography and the music

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.439 
sort of the choreography and the music
we<00:00:41.829> work<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.160> lot<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.519> barrel<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.210> it's<00:00:43.360> a

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
we work a lot on the barrel so it's a

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.750 
we work a lot on the barrel so it's a
static<00:00:43.839> course<00:00:44.079> just<00:00:44.409> and<00:00:44.769> that<00:00:45.550> doesn't

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
static course just and that doesn't

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.310 
static course just and that doesn't
bother<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.329> different<00:00:46.600> move<00:00:46.780> with<00:00:47.020> a<00:00:47.050> roller

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
bother to different move with a roller

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.380 
bother to different move with a roller
on<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.710> so<00:00:47.949> we<00:00:48.100> practice<00:00:48.579> all<00:00:48.730> our<00:00:48.850> routines<00:00:49.210> on

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
on it so we practice all our routines on

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.119 
on it so we practice all our routines on
there<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:49.840> normally<00:00:50.620> throughout<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.039> winter

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
there and normally throughout the winter

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.030 
there and normally throughout the winter
we<00:00:51.489> can<00:00:51.520> decide<00:00:51.910> what<00:00:52.120> music<00:00:52.390> we're<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.660> to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
we can decide what music we're going to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.130 
we can decide what music we're going to
the<00:00:53.520> choreography<00:00:54.090> facial<00:00:54.510> expressions<00:00:54.990> are

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the choreography facial expressions are

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
the choreography facial expressions are
a<00:00:55.170> big<00:00:55.380> part<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
a big part of it and then from that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
a big part of it and then from that
we're<00:00:57.630> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.080> walk<00:00:58.290> on<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.650> horse<00:00:58.860> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
we're going to walk on the horse you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.980 
we're going to walk on the horse you
want<00:00:59.280> news<00:00:59.460> worth<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.850> lot<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.450> then<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
want news worth a lot down and then the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.870 
want news worth a lot down and then the
routine<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.470> builds<00:01:01.830> up<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.220> then<00:01:02.490> by<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
routine just builds up and then by the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.700 
routine just builds up and then by the
end<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.540> hopefully<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.500> perspective

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
end of it hopefully it's all perspective

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.800 
end of it hopefully it's all perspective
and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.380 
and

better<00:01:22.250> at<00:01:22.549> faulting<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.060> general<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.689> I

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
better at faulting in general and I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.899 
better at faulting in general and I
thought<00:01:24.770> three<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.159> us<00:01:25.250> are<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.549> top<00:01:25.700> seven

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
thought three of us are in the top seven

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.029 
thought three of us are in the top seven
the<00:01:26.179> FEI<00:01:26.450> rankings<00:01:26.960> individually<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:27.799> as

individuals we're hoping we've got a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.460 
individuals we're hoping we've got a
good<00:01:29.420> chance<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.869> actually<00:01:29.960> bringing<00:01:30.289> home

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
good chance of actually bringing home

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.410 
good chance of actually bringing home
some<00:01:30.619> really<00:01:30.860> good<00:01:30.950> results<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.640> personal

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
best scores swell for Great Britain and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.850 
best scores swell for Great Britain and
within<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.299> world<00:01:35.720> as<00:01:35.899> well<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.350> lot<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.649> other

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
within the world as well a lot of other

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.440 
within the world as well a lot of other
nations<00:01:37.070> feudal<00:01:37.610> smaller<00:01:37.850> nations<00:01:38.090> are

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
nations feudal smaller nations are

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.520 
nations feudal smaller nations are
beginning<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.929> become<00:01:39.049> more<00:01:39.319> prominent

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
beginning to become more prominent

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.770 
beginning to become more prominent
