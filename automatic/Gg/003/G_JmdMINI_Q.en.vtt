00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.150
 ah 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.800
 Good evening on August 10 , 2050 and 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.930
 we continue with very high temperatures already 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.449
 go 10 days in much of the country with 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.559
 values ​​above the average the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.120
 temperatures are going to continue to be 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.640
 elevated during the next hours 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.620
 because the Saharan air mass is going to 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.449
 keep on spain along the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.640
 next few days although it will slowly go away 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.040
 withdrawing we will continue talking about a lot 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.480
 heat on everything even more 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.010
 especially in bathed communities 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.050
 through the Mediterranean there rise the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.000
 temperatures and will also increase the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.489
 bad visibility today we have had notices 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.309
 activated red level by temperatures 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.049
 maximum higher than 44 degrees in 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.180
 much of the center of the country tomorrow it 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.710
 repeat these warnings because the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.350
 temperatures as we said are kept 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.030
 or even go up we do a review of the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.530
 temperatures during the last hours 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.119
 in the valley of the guadalquivir in córdoba 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 have come to touch the 50 degrees more than 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.680
 45 in much of the peninsular interior 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.930
 with temperatures that also exceed 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.220
 35 degrees in the Mediterranean there the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.560
 feeling of embarrassment is very 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.680
 meaningful all the Cantabrian with 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.720
 maximum values above 37 38 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.750
 and the high ebro above the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.240
 45 only something remains outside of 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.560
 so much heat the Galician coast also the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.590
 North plateau and maximum temperatures 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.720
 exceed 40 degrees but they 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.330
 we want to set the maximum and the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.320
 minimum go to madrid today the temperature 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.490
 maximum of 45 and the minimum of 28 in fact 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.050
 during the last days the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 maximum temperatures have been between 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.390
 44 and 45 degrees in the capital 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.120
 but the minimums have been between 27 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.650
 and the 29 that's why between 10 o'clock 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.010
 night and 8 in the morning that would be 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.460
 the hours of sleep we find values 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.399
 to sleep between 28 29 and more than 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.740
 40 degrees it is difficult to fall asleep 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.510
 these days in much of Spain 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.180
 tomorrow the same situation continues 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.860
 we will continue talking about sun of warmth in 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.270
 the Mediterranean and just some 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.650
 showers in the Pyrenees today we have 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.520
 wanted to go outside to see what 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.510
 people's opinion 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:31.610
 and he knew very hot but well so 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.410
 that it is very hot is horrible and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.780
 you have to be drinking a lot of water 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.930
 and walk all the time looking for 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.050
 shadows and the horrible heat as it goes 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:48.150
 because we are not used to 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:54.450
 in the shade of the shadow a hat 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:57.030
 solar water protection go to day of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.850
 frightening heat and see that I forget 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.720
 hot days today 37 years ago that I 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.569
 I married and I remember it was 41 degrees 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.569
 today it would seem cool to us and then 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.730
 a record temperature 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.549
 because Carmen was right he was referring to the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.849
 heat wave we had in August of 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.650
 2010 with the extremely high temperatures 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.299
 ICCP forecasts, I said that the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.099
 temperatures were going to rise in the 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.010
 Mediterranean temperatures that could 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.930
 rise even up to 5 degrees in some 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.879
 points in Spain we have registered a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.310
 increase in maximum temperatures 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.079
 between the two and the two and a half degrees 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.840
 in the Cantabrian and between more than three 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.040
 even in some points more than four 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.389
 in the maxims but also in the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.969
 minimum minimum temperatures that have 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.669
 raised from the order of the three grades to what 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.469
 over the last thirty years it has been 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.120
 increased the number of warm days 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.889
 has also increased the number of 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.569
 warm nights practically all 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.299
 nights are warm in the period 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.159
 summer in much of downtown and 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.870
 south of the country and the 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.340
 How many heat waves 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.409
 days in a row we have temperatures 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.769
 so high in some points about 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.409
 all of the south more than ten days more than 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.639
 heat waves that we had before and the 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.519
 forecasts say that during 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.449
 next decades will continue the increase this 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.990
 is the forecast for the Mediterranean 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:17.489
 by the end of the century the temperatures 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.590
 they were going up for the moment we were staying 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.570
 shorter term 'the forecast for 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.490
 next few days it's still 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.130
 elevated temperatures although they will go 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.870
 lowering a little increase on Thursday 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.370
 we hope for a day that will continue 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.720
 sunny with temperatures that 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.060
 they will keep high and we will talk again 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.490
 of cali plus high temperatures 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.280
 with values ​​over again from the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.480
 45 degrees in the center and in the south in 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.950
 beginning on Friday will begin to enter 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.930
 a little bit of north with which 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.670
 will breathe something more relieved in the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.710
 Cantabrian communities and that 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.050
 thermal descent will mean that there 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.430
 finish that heat wave that has 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.040
 maintained the highest temperatures of 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.930
 normal up to 10 days in that sector and 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.670
 already facing Saturday the cloudiness 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.130
 will begin to enter the west of the country 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.480
 for now without precipitation will continue 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.460
 doing only in the rest of Spain ' 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.050
 but the temperatures in that area 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.490
 will fall below the values ​​that 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.310
 we consider heat wave and 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.740
 this 15-day heat wave would end 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.360
 followed throughout that area and we just 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.730
 as always with our saying 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.370
 metrological for the day and tells us 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.050
 by san lorenzo very intense heat and what 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.750

 very hot day these years a lot 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.470

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.470
 good dates 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.110
 good to give the super show room with it 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.110
 happen the noodle rules when I change 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.500
 come in very easy have christiana 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.500
 Figueres

 Fortune to watch live with tv we have 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.140
 the power and the responsibility to 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.320
 create perfect forest in network 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.800
