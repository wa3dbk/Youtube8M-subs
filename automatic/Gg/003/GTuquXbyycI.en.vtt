at<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.560> first<00:01:29.829> flash<00:01:30.159> where<00:01:30.429> it<00:01:30.490> goes<00:01:30.579> up<00:01:30.789> into

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
at the first flash where it goes up into

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.730 
at the first flash where it goes up into
the<00:01:31.179> clouds<00:01:31.450> all<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:31.719> guess<00:01:31.929> when<00:01:32.079> I<00:01:32.109> do<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.469> pull

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
the clouds all I guess when I do is pull

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.469 
the clouds all I guess when I do is pull
out<00:01:32.890> your<00:01:33.070> Ethernet<00:01:33.579> cable<00:01:33.609> so<00:01:34.359> it

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
out your Ethernet cable so it

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.330 
out your Ethernet cable so it
disconnects<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.140> from<00:01:35.200> live<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.890> brings<00:01:36.159> you

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
disconnects you from live and brings you
