00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.440
 find tonight in this wonderful 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.410
 very distinguished outfit to make you a 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.880
 hairdressing tutorial as well as a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.110
 technique to do this pretty 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.809
 curls at like at the beach 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 so here I am already going out of the shower 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 so that explains a little bit this side 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 neglect doctors and so I got 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 washed the hair with a super shampoo 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.710
 so there he still wet someone 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.630
 someone mccomas of the eye his 1,100 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 solid points and it really feels great 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 he is nourishing he is shining 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 the hair and then I used the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.680
 rafistoller which is an approach in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.110
 point 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.210
 so here's to do this hairstyle in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.129
 does it's a bit basic hairstyle 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.760
 to make a ton of super hairstyle 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.180
 and lots of events like that so we 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 first brush the hair well me 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.180

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.899
 put it back to you here you have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.199

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.909
 how am I going to do away on the side 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:11.010
 I say it in three a little bit this side 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:14.670
 like that one milking you have the three 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.520
 wicks and places like braids 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.729
 I 'm going to his parents so are there from 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.450
 right is going to be in the middle the wick 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.150
 it also left in the middle 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:38.790
 I do a salto like that afterwards 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.210
 left right I take the guy I the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.200
 joust 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.000
 we're going to celebrate kings and here I started 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.740
 a little bit of spinning along manic 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.009
 and the last bit 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 here you see legs and I am 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.390
 put off tomorrow I'm losing I'm turning a 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.520
 little for you see and there I finish my 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.049
 normally press then always in 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.099
 beating Belgium by two under par 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:10.000
 on top of me then I'm going to do the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.130
 choose me 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 look at it then I'll take invited the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.090
 stick could leave it like that you 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.400
 see you tie here and that makes you 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.500
 a pretty little hairstyle and me what 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 I will take sides is to make a 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.990
 nice bun on the side even the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.620
 started here the elk snail rolls I 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.170
 roll in a ball up and I do like that I 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.570
 make sure that the little tea 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.380
 sitting does not see himself so once from the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.840
 mouloud if you're proud I take 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.770
 rolls that's it I'm doing this for 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.330
 show you because I'm going 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.080
 to sleep so leave him stranded because 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.240
 otherwise it will embarrass me 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.220
 I miss a little spice now 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.340
 remove but you 're going that result 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:03.950
 here it is and to decorate a little 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.240
 the hairstyle you can who can 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.490
 add small axes and that of 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.550
 flowers for example to brighten up a little 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:21.530
 all that's it 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:26.540
 and that makes you a pretty early childhood 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.070
 and machete what is normally it's 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.780
 well it's also cards and a little 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.500
 press me because I want it 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.400
 stay well sealed for the facts that I 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.400
 want to have tomorrow 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.660
 I'm back after a good night's sleep 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.670
 sleep I could put on makeup 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.250
 I might put the tutor on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.310
 youtube and we will be able to move to the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.730
 unveiling part of the loops so 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.080
 first I'm going to take off the press that's fine 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.080
 make very tight little loops 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.680
 that's what it gives at first glance 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.380
 so that's a little too structured 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.709
 again what you can do next 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.049
 it's either like me you take a 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.690
 sort of a spray there is the spray 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.150
 care brilliance of the little Marseille and 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.700
 it allows a little blur the loops 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.110
 because it's a bit too hard 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.340
 hard 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.040
 I take that otherwise you can also 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.870
 take for example a sudden loop 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.940
 like that to have beautiful curls 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.320
 restructure or for that which 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.500
 unlike me have not already lÃ© 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.230
 way can loop naturally after 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:51.660
 this step to proceed to Step ac 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:57.210
 otherwise it will not fit then the spray 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:01.310
 a little matter in my hands here but 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.310
 there I pass the hand for a little bit 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.720
 to make the books a little more 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.710
 natural as if you really go out 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.710
 of bed like that normal 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.080
 and that's how it can make 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.370
 so me today I'm going to do I have 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.080
 decided I will always take this 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.440
 side there the beautiful loop up 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.460
 so I'm going to take I'll bring back the 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:44.820
 wick like that and I take some 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:48.780
 small crocodile clips could block on 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.289
 the side so I kept the good 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.289
 small antilles 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:16.750
 I will even always cost the title 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:19.010
 last it allows me to have these 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.570
 who will last me all day 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:28.700
 so maybe I'll make the choice 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:30.140
 me to add a because crocos in 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.710
 bringing back paths a little by art 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.710
 is stopped 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.570
 hello quietly eat a fondue 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.170
 sat afternoon this is all for 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.270
 today 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:55.020
 I'm getting ready to go and 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.020
 then see you soon I put on a little outfit 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:13.200
 she is strong enough in the world
