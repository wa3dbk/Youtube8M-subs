00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.000 
stuff here so right off the bat let's go
into<00:00:32.910> slow<00:00:33.059> motion<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.680> house

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
into slow motion here we have the house

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.160 
into slow motion here we have the house
with<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> ghost<00:00:35.730> woman's<00:00:36.210> last<00:00:36.480> which<00:00:36.899> I'm

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
with the ghost woman's last which I'm

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
with the ghost woman's last which I'm
guessing<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.950> had<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> strong<00:00:38.730> feeling<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
guessing I had a strong feeling this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
guessing I had a strong feeling this
house<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:39.660> include<00:00:40.050> something<00:00:40.410> easter<00:00:40.980> egg

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
house would include something easter egg

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.100 
house would include something easter egg
wise<00:00:41.370> i'm<00:00:41.700> guessing<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.450> too<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.989> also

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
wise i'm guessing that too when we also

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.440 
wise i'm guessing that too when we also
saw<00:00:43.320> russman<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:44.219> also<00:00:44.489> has<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> had<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> pack<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
saw russman he also has a had a pack a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.819 
saw russman he also has a had a pack a
punch<00:00:45.719> weapon<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> actually<00:00:46.649> pretty

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
punch weapon which is actually pretty

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
punch weapon which is actually pretty
cool<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> pack<00:00:48.059> punch<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.420> still

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
cool so we know the pack punch is still

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
cool so we know the pack punch is still
here<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.079> well<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.410> saw<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> location<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> jug

here so let's go ahead and break it down

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.950 
here so let's go ahead and break it down
we<00:00:59.070> also<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.940> light<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.390> speed<00:01:00.600> Cola

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.920 
we also see the light for speed Cola
above<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.430> place<00:01:02.820> i'm<00:01:03.120> guessing<00:01:03.570> speed<00:01:03.750> cool

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
above in a place i'm guessing speed cool

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
above in a place i'm guessing speed cool
it's<00:01:04.110> pretty<00:01:04.170> green<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:05.970> actually

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's pretty green so that's actually

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's pretty green so that's actually
quite<00:01:06.479> interesting<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:08.130> also<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
quite interesting to see we also see a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.530 
quite interesting to see we also see a
new<00:01:08.640> location<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.150> haven't<00:01:09.330> seen<00:01:09.450> before

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
new location we haven't seen before

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
new location we haven't seen before
which<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> courthouse<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:11.340> in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
which is the courthouse probably in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
which is the courthouse probably in
behind<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> prison<00:01:12.780> i'm<00:01:12.869> guessing<00:01:13.320> that'll

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
behind the prison i'm guessing that'll

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
behind the prison i'm guessing that'll
be<00:01:14.189> probably<00:01:14.460> how<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> prisoner

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
be probably how you get to the prisoner

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.289 
be probably how you get to the prisoner
and<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> guys<00:01:16.439> notice<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.280> most<00:01:17.549> kind

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and if you guys notice the most kind

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.789 
and if you guys notice the most kind
most<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> shots<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
most of the shots we see with the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.950 
most of the shots we see with the
prisoner<00:01:20.189> he's<00:01:20.400> actually<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:21.150> samuel<00:01:21.780> which

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
prisoner he's actually with samuel which

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.370 
prisoner he's actually with samuel which
kind<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.380> confirms<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:23.070> theory<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.380> Samuels

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
kind of confirms my theory that Samuels

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
kind of confirms my theory that Samuels
are<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.250> only<00:01:26.460> guy

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
are going to be the really only guy

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
are going to be the really only guy
who's<00:01:26.939> actually<00:01:27.119> able<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> communicate<00:01:27.990> with

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
who's actually able to communicate with

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
who's actually able to communicate with
the<00:01:28.950> prisoner<00:01:29.430> mainly<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.150> i'm<00:01:30.390> guessing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the prisoner mainly because i'm guessing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
the prisoner mainly because i'm guessing
the<00:01:30.689> prisoner<00:01:31.049> has<00:01:31.200> eight<00:01:31.439> zombies<00:01:32.130> before

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the prisoner has eight zombies before

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
the prisoner has eight zombies before
I'm<00:01:32.640> that's<00:01:32.909> how<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.180> guessing<00:01:33.479> he<00:01:33.600> survived

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I'm that's how I'm guessing he survived

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
I'm that's how I'm guessing he survived
here<00:01:34.409> he's<00:01:34.590> been<00:01:34.829> eating<00:01:35.009> flesh<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:36.689> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
here he's been eating flesh so he can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
here he's been eating flesh so he can
communicate<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.530> Samuel<00:01:38.340> through<00:01:38.610> his<00:01:38.759> mind

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
communicate with Samuel through his mind

right now as you guys can see there's

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.509 
right now as you guys can see there's
appears<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.329> be<00:03:06.389> a<00:03:06.419> shining<00:03:06.750> object<00:03:07.169> in<00:03:07.799> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
appears to be a shining object in the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.039 
appears to be a shining object in the
prison<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.239> we<00:03:09.299> haven't<00:03:09.480> seen<00:03:09.569> before<00:03:09.659> and

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
prison that we haven't seen before and

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.619 
prison that we haven't seen before and
also<00:03:10.199> the<00:03:10.409> prison<00:03:10.769> has<00:03:10.919> no<00:03:11.099> lights<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.699> it<00:03:11.879> so

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
also the prison has no lights in it so

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.500 
also the prison has no lights in it so
that<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.019> interesting<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.799> see<00:03:14.099> i'm<00:03:14.510> guessing

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that is interesting to see i'm guessing

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.449 
that is interesting to see i'm guessing
maybe<00:03:15.870> there<00:03:16.139> is<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.349> power<00:03:16.620> switch<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:17.219> you

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
maybe there is a power switch that you

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
map they went to did the research at a

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.509 
map they went to did the research at a
place<00:03:30.870> called<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.229> think<00:03:31.439> it's<00:03:31.530> silicone<00:03:31.829> ghost

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
post a link to it and where it is or

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.300 
post a link to it and where it is or
what<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.229> is<00:03:43.379> a<00:03:43.409> basically<00:03:43.979> like

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
what it kind of is a basically like

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.610 
what it kind of is a basically like
where<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.669> on<00:03:44.699> the<00:03:44.970> world<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:46.079> i<00:03:46.109> guess<00:03:46.379> you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
where it is on the world so i guess you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.899 
where it is on the world so i guess you
guys<00:03:46.799> would<00:03:46.979> like<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.370> where<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.549> is

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
guys would like to know where that is

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.280 
guys would like to know where that is
but<00:03:48.090> that's<00:03:48.449> basically<00:03:48.689> where<00:03:48.989> they<00:03:49.109> did<00:03:49.259> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
but that's basically where they did the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.749 
but that's basically where they did the
research<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.129> they<00:03:50.189> should<00:03:50.310> have<00:03:50.430> lots<00:03:50.669> of

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
research of and they should have lots of

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.089 
research of and they should have lots of
pictures<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.409> including<00:03:52.409> how<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:52.709> did<00:03:52.859> a<00:03:52.889> lot

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
pictures I including how they did a lot

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.159 
pictures I including how they did a lot
of<00:03:53.129> I'm<00:03:53.790> guessing<00:03:53.970> there's<00:03:54.269> will<00:03:54.689> be<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> lot<00:03:55.139> of

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
of I'm guessing there's will be a lot of

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.809 
of I'm guessing there's will be a lot of
mine<00:03:55.379> shaft<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.799> actually<00:03:56.189> this<00:03:56.250> map<00:03:56.459> may<00:03:56.759> be

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
mine shaft so actually this map may be

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.839 
mine shaft so actually this map may be
actually<00:03:57.150> really<00:03:57.840> big<00:03:58.139> which<00:03:58.979> I<00:03:59.159> want<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.819> want

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
actually really big which I want I want

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.610 
actually really big which I want I want
a<00:04:00.209> really<00:04:00.569> big<00:04:00.780> map<00:04:00.989> because<00:04:01.319> really<00:04:01.560> I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
a really big map because really I

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.080 
a really big map because really I
haven't<00:04:01.829> there's<00:04:02.129> always<00:04:02.400> new<00:04:02.639> stuff<00:04:02.939> I'm

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
saying here and there's lots of big open

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
saying here and there's lots of big open
areas<00:04:05.129> half<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.489> time<00:04:05.639> which<00:04:06.209> actually<00:04:06.389> quite

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
areas half the time which actually quite

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.249 
areas half the time which actually quite
interesting<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.290> see<00:04:08.269> so<00:04:09.269> another<00:04:09.780> thing<00:04:09.900> is

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
I'm just really excited for this map

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.069 
I'm just really excited for this map
there's<00:04:17.340> lots<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.820> stuff<00:04:17.940> in<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.329> 20<00:04:18.659> seconds

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
there's lots of stuff in this 20 seconds

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.680 
there's lots of stuff in this 20 seconds
I'll<00:04:19.469> try<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.859> get<00:04:20.009> covered<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.489> all<00:04:20.639> but<00:04:21.539> that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.000 
I'll try and get covered it all but that
house<00:04:21.930> looks<00:04:21.959> like<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.800> be<00:04:22.889> your

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
house looks like it's going to be your

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.330 
house looks like it's going to be your
main<00:04:23.599> point<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.050> Easter<00:04:25.500> egg<00:04:25.590> if<00:04:25.830> anything

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
main point of the Easter egg if anything

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.810 
main point of the Easter egg if anything
so<00:04:26.490> that's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
so that's

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.580
