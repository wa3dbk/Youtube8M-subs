00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that's bringing me on to this which is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
that's bringing me on to this which is
my<00:00:52.020> new<00:00:52.230> series<00:00:52.469> idea<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.129> thought<00:00:53.340> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
my new series idea which I thought of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
my new series idea which I thought of
now<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> limit<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.780> 100<00:00:54.960> baby

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
now as there was a limit on 100 baby

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
now as there was a limit on 100 baby
challenge<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.710> went<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> series<00:00:56.460> where<00:00:56.579> there

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
challenge I went to a series where there

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.779 
challenge I went to a series where there
wasn't<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.510> limit<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.800> idea<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
wasn't a limit and my idea is that I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.670 
wasn't a limit and my idea is that I
start<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> minecraft<00:01:00.660> singleplayer<00:01:00.809> world

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
start a minecraft singleplayer world

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.490 
start a minecraft singleplayer world
just<00:01:02.190> randomly<00:01:02.520> generated<00:01:03.120> world<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
just randomly generated world and then I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.700 
just randomly generated world and then I
build<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> Minecraft<00:01:05.880> city<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.750> each<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
build like a Minecraft city and each of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
build like a Minecraft city and each of
the<00:01:07.830> houses<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.520> suggested<00:01:09.090> by<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the houses is suggested by you and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.880 
the houses is suggested by you and
that's<00:01:09.960> probably<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.260> making<00:01:10.470> any<00:01:10.560> sense<00:01:10.590> at

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's probably not making any sense at

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
that's probably not making any sense at
the<00:01:10.950> moment<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.909> gonna<00:01:12.119> plan<00:01:12.420> on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the moment so what I was gonna plan on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
the moment so what I was gonna plan on
doing<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> build<00:01:14.670> my

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
doing was that I was going to build my

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240 
doing was that I was going to build my
house<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> center<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> city<00:01:17.009> hall

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
house in the center or like a city hall

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
house in the center or like a city hall
or<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.750> could

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
or something like that and then we could

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.710 
or something like that and then we could
have<00:01:18.930> streets<00:01:19.500> full<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> houses<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.390> things

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
have streets full of houses with things

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
have streets full of houses with things
suggested<00:01:22.290> by<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.220> comments<00:01:23.549> would

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
suggested by you so the comments would

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
suggested by you so the comments would
suggest<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.210> house<00:01:24.420> sighs<00:01:24.780> how<00:01:25.140> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
suggest the house sighs how it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
suggest the house sighs how it's

and<00:01:32.490> stuff<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.689> could

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and stuff like that and then we could

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.270 
and stuff like that and then we could
have<00:01:33.930> people<00:01:34.170> living<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.740> houses<00:01:34.950> from

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
have people living in these houses from

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
have people living in these houses from
the<00:01:35.310> micro<00:01:35.640> comes<00:01:35.850> alive<00:01:36.090> mod<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.450> we'd<00:01:36.540> have

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the micro comes alive mod so we'd have

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
the micro comes alive mod so we'd have
like<00:01:36.840> hundreds<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.320> people<00:01:37.740> living<00:01:37.979> inside<00:01:38.189> we

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
like hundreds of people living inside we

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
like hundreds of people living inside we
could<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.180> time-lapse<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> building<00:01:40.229> of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
could also time-lapse the building of

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
could also time-lapse the building of
the<00:01:40.380> houses<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> make<00:01:41.040> time<00:01:41.250> lapse<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the houses and make time lapse of out of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.910 
the houses and make time lapse of out of
it<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> yet<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.020> endless<00:01:43.500> things<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it and yet there be endless things that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
it and yet there be endless things that
people<00:01:44.189> could<00:01:44.280> suggest<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.030> say<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> built<00:01:45.479> five

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
people could suggest so say I built five

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990 
people could suggest so say I built five
houses<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.649> episode<00:01:47.189> sort<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.820> we

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
houses and episode sort of thing we

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
houses and episode sort of thing we
could<00:01:48.119> split<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.509> into<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:49.110> than<00:01:49.290> five

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
could split it up into more than five

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.139 
could split it up into more than five
comments<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.610> instead<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.850> having<00:01:50.909> one

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
comments so instead of having one

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
comments so instead of having one
comment<00:01:51.869> per<00:01:51.960> house<00:01:52.350> sort<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> thing<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.009> could

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
comment per house sort of thing we could

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
comment per house sort of thing we could
have<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> comment<00:01:53.880> suggesting<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.170> size<00:01:55.439> of

and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.209> over<00:02:12.599> time<00:02:12.629> we

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and I think over time we

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
and I think over time we
you<00:02:13.560> see<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.890> city<00:02:14.100> grow<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.940> look

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

amazing<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:16.200> i<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.860> create<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
amazing and then i can create like a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.160 
amazing and then i can create like a
massive<00:02:17.580> time-lapse<00:02:18.210> like<00:02:18.510> every<00:02:18.960> 10

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
massive time-lapse like every 10

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.540 
massive time-lapse like every 10
episodes<00:02:19.590> are<00:02:19.740> somewhat<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.100> showing<00:02:20.430> the
