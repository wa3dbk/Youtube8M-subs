00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.750 
plus sign by the positive and the
negative<00:01:21.640> got<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.670> minor<00:01:23.000> so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.120 

when<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:28.940> disconnected<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.750> positive<00:01:30.260> now<00:01:30.470> as

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
when so disconnected a positive now as

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.730 
when so disconnected a positive now as
you<00:01:31.250> can<00:01:31.400> see<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:34.340> move<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:35.020> way<00:01:36.050> chuck<00:01:36.710> it

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
you can see just move that way chuck it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.770 
you can see just move that way chuck it
so<00:01:37.040> my<00:01:37.190> face<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.460> not<00:01:38.050> really<00:01:39.050> in<00:01:39.200> any<00:01:39.350> metal<00:01:40.780> no

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
so my face is not really in any metal no

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.680 
so my face is not really in any metal no
just<00:01:42.050> take<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.380> battery<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:44.150> I've<00:01:44.330> taken<00:01:44.509> a

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
just take the battery and I've taken a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.200 
just take the battery and I've taken a
battery<00:01:45.110> room<00:01:45.170> now

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
battery room now

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.380 
battery room now
put<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.300> new<00:01:47.450> battery<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:49.030> always<00:01:50.030> make<00:01:50.360> sure

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
put the new battery in always make sure

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.469 
put the new battery in always make sure
the<00:01:50.600> terminals<00:01:51.460> on<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.610> same<00:01:52.820> size<00:01:53.150> where<00:01:53.450> you

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the terminals on the same size where you

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.469 
the terminals on the same size where you
took<00:01:53.720> them<00:01:53.900> off<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> positive<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.270> just

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
took them off so the positive is just

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.190 
took them off so the positive is just
side<00:01:56.740> negatives<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.830> side<00:01:59.020> I'm<00:02:00.020> gonna

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
side negatives that side I'm gonna

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:11.710 
side negatives that side I'm gonna
connect<00:02:00.619> up<00:02:01.720> positive<00:02:10.060> not<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.330> tighten

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
connect up positive not just tighten

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.370 
connect up positive not just tighten
that<00:02:11.750> up<00:02:11.900> now<00:02:12.820> as<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.209> can<00:02:14.330> see<00:02:14.540> now<00:02:14.750> connected

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
that up now as you can see now connected

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.800 
that up now as you can see now connected
up<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.680> positive<00:02:16.580> back<00:02:16.820> up<00:02:17.030> put<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.570> cover

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
up the positive back up put the cover

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.740 
up the positive back up put the cover
over<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.940> now<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:21.260> connect<00:02:21.590> up<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.340> negative

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
over it now to connect up the negative

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.680 
over it now to connect up the negative
like<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.850> matter<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.239> tightening

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
like so it's just a matter of tightening

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.930 
like so it's just a matter of tightening
now<00:02:30.220> now<00:02:31.220> I've<00:02:31.430> connected<00:02:31.790> both<00:02:32.209> terminals

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
now now I've connected both terminals

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.970 
now now I've connected both terminals
make<00:02:34.540> sure<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.840> I'm<00:02:35.470> not<00:02:35.500> really<00:02:35.830> tight<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
make sure that I'm not really tight and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.850 
make sure that I'm not really tight and
that<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.490> tune<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.120> they're<00:02:40.660> not<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:41.830> a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
that you can tune it they're not got a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.880 
that you can tune it they're not got a
good<00:02:42.160> connection<00:02:42.490> on<00:02:42.790> both<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:43.300> them<00:02:43.890> once

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
good connection on both of them once

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.070 
good connection on both of them once
that's<00:02:45.070> done<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.640> show<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> battery<00:02:46.630> nation

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
that's done you show a battery nation

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.920 
that's done you show a battery nation
square<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.970> next<00:02:49.240> thing<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.540> put<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
square the next thing is to put the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.930 
square the next thing is to put the
bracket<00:02:50.320> back<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:51.160> hold<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.490> battery<00:02:51.850> in

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
bracket back on to hold the battery in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.600 
bracket back on to hold the battery in
place<00:02:52.560> as<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:57.010> bracket<00:02:57.490> is

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
place as you can see now my bracket is
