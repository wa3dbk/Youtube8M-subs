00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.430 
him off but with the super minions this
is<00:04:39.310> gonna<00:04:39.460> be<00:04:39.669> an<00:04:40.060> easy<00:04:40.300> turret<00:04:40.780> probably<00:04:41.349> an

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
is gonna be an easy turret probably an

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.279 
is gonna be an easy turret probably an
inhibitor<00:04:41.860> yeah<00:04:42.389> yeah<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:43.690> they<00:04:43.810> tumbled<00:04:44.169> on

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
inhibitor yeah yeah so they tumbled on

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.619 
inhibitor yeah yeah so they tumbled on
bengi<00:04:44.680> they<00:04:44.830> got<00:04:45.039> him<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:45.490> they're<00:04:46.449> gonna

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
bengi they got him but they're gonna

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:47.820 
bengi they got him but they're gonna
lose<00:04:46.840> an<00:04:46.990> inhibitor<00:04:47.379> for<00:04:47.560> it

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
lose an inhibitor for it

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.559 
lose an inhibitor for it
if<00:04:48.220> they<00:04:48.400> had<00:04:48.490> just<00:04:48.699> treated<00:04:49.030> one<00:04:49.210> for<00:04:49.449> one

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
if they had just treated one for one

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:50.879 
if they had just treated one for one
right<00:04:49.780> there<00:04:49.990> definitely<00:04:50.289> would<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.800> been

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
right there definitely would have been

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.100 
right there definitely would have been
worthwhile<00:04:51.129> to<00:04:51.520> slow<00:04:51.789> down<00:04:51.969> SK<00:04:52.330> Telecom<00:04:52.810> it's

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
worthwhile to slow down SK Telecom it's

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.899 
worthwhile to slow down SK Telecom it's
going<00:04:53.319> to<00:04:53.469> freely<00:04:54.009> auto<00:04:54.280> attack<00:04:54.699> the

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
going to freely auto attack the

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.730 
going to freely auto attack the
inhibitor<00:04:55.330> turret<00:04:55.509> I'm<00:04:56.289> gonna<00:04:56.409> try<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.650> get

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
inhibitor turret I'm gonna try and get

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.399 
inhibitor turret I'm gonna try and get
him<00:04:59.580> in<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:00.669> lot<00:05:00.909> of<00:05:00.940> trouble<00:05:01.599> now<00:05:01.629> Wolf's<00:05:02.080> a

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
him in a lot of trouble now Wolf's a

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.230

after<00:05:12.819> this<00:05:12.969> they<00:05:13.150> can<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.449> take<00:05:13.599> more

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
after this they can just take more
