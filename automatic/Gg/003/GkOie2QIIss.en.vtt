that out well basically what we'll have
to<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.700> start<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> state<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> your

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to do is start with the state of your

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
to do is start with the state of your
floors<00:00:37.770> okay

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
floors okay

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.510 
floors okay
get<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> bare<00:00:39.390> wood<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.890> how

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
get it down to bare wood just to see how

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700 
get it down to bare wood just to see how
deep<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> stain<00:00:42.239> right<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.930> then

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
deep the stain right there and then

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
deep the stain right there and then
based<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.219> information<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:45.270> could<00:00:45.690> do

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
based on that information we could do

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.950 
based on that information we could do
one<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> two<00:00:46.469> things<00:00:46.579> we<00:00:47.579> could<00:00:47.820> either<00:00:48.059> remove

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
one of two things we could either remove

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.189 
one of two things we could either remove
the<00:00:49.289> would<00:00:49.500> completely<00:00:50.539> repatched<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the would completely repatched it in and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.619 
the would completely repatched it in and
then<00:00:52.770> it'll<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.670> brand<00:00:53.940> new<00:00:54.000> it'll<00:00:54.420> blend

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
then it'll all be brand new it'll blend

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.430 
then it'll all be brand new it'll blend
perfectly<00:00:55.129> or<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> stain<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
perfectly or if we think the stain we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
perfectly or if we think the stain we
can<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.770> most<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> stain<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can get most of the stain out but this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
can get most of the stain out but this
still<00:01:00.570> might<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.899> slight<00:01:01.199> outline<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.489> could

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
still might be a slight outline we could

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
still might be a slight outline we could
stain<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> floors<00:01:03.570> dark<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:05.070> will

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
stain all the floors dark and that will

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
stain all the floors dark and that will
help<00:01:05.309> mask<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.619> problem

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
help mask the problem
