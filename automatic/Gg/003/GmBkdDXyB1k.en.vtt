is<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:14.940> arsenic<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.480> chicken<00:00:15.870> because<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
is there arsenic in chicken because it's

fed to them mmm finger looking good

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.230 
fed to them mmm finger looking good
basically<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.359> rat<00:00:21.630> poison<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.410> chicken<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
basically it's rat poison in chicken and

arsenic in the chicken thing not a big
deal<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.450> they're<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.049> maybe<00:01:08.270> maybe

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
deal now they're going well maybe maybe

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
deal now they're going well maybe maybe
there's<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> maybe<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
there's a maybe there's a little bit of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.780 
there's a maybe there's a little bit of
cancer-causing<00:01:12.350> going<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
cancer-causing going on there with the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
cancer-causing going on there with the
bladder<00:01:15.299> cancer<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.080> lung<00:01:16.229> cancer<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.189> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bladder cancer and lung cancer but it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
bladder cancer and lung cancer but it's
not<00:01:17.820> everybody<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.049> will<00:01:19.439> keep<00:01:19.680> letting

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
not everybody so it will keep letting

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.249 
not everybody so it will keep letting
people<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.270> their<00:01:21.450> chicken<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.960> ahead

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
people put it in their chicken go ahead

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.260 
people put it in their chicken go ahead
no<00:01:22.380> problem<00:01:22.740> meanwhile<00:01:23.159> Europe's<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.640> we

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
no problem meanwhile Europe's like we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
no problem meanwhile Europe's like we
don't<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.750> chicken<00:01:25.020> your's<00:01:25.830> always

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
don't want your chicken your's always

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
don't want your chicken your's always
much<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.430> advanced<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> US<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> banning

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
much more advanced in the US and banning

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.870 
much more advanced in the US and banning
things<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> kill<00:01:28.860> us<00:01:28.890> i<00:01:29.310> yes

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
things that are going to kill us i yes

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.210 
things that are going to kill us i yes
that's<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that's what it is so now the thing is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.819 
that's what it is so now the thing is
that<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.970> FDA<00:01:33.210> said<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.470> because

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that the FDA said you know because

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.920 
that the FDA said you know because
there's<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.850> any<00:01:36.060> arsenic<00:01:36.390> left<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
there's not any arsenic left in the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
there's not any arsenic left in the
chicken<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.400> poop<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.090> out

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
chicken because they poop it all out

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.359 
chicken because they poop it all out
that's<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.259> say<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.920> poop<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> all

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
poop all of it out it ends up in their

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.179 
poop all of it out it ends up in their
meat<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.020> poop<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.740> poop<00:01:47.009> out

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
meat but the poop that they do poop out

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
meat but the poop that they do poop out
highly<00:01:48.119> concentrated<00:01:48.420> poop<00:01:49.640> poison<00:01:50.640> arsenic

highly concentrated poop poison arsenic
chicken<00:01:52.170> poop<00:01:52.439> okay<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.869> also

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
chicken poop okay now and I think also

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.569 
chicken poop okay now and I think also
like<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> chicken<00:01:56.310> poop<00:01:56.460> are

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
like when we think of chicken poop are

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.069 
like when we think of chicken poop are
like<00:01:56.700> okay<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.750> our<00:01:57.899> food

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
like okay that's not going in our food

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
like okay that's not going in our food
that's<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.500> outside<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> cases<00:01:59.460> really

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that's like outside of the cases really

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
that's like outside of the cases really
the<00:02:00.000> reality<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.140> chickens<00:02:01.860> are

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the reality of this is that chickens are

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.370 
the reality of this is that chickens are
stuffed<00:02:02.549> into<00:02:02.790> tiny<00:02:03.149> cages<00:02:03.570> they're<00:02:04.200> not

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
stuffed into tiny cages they're not

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.749 
stuffed into tiny cages they're not
allowed<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.710> move<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.070> fact<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.369> really

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
allowed to move in fact they really

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
allowed to move in fact they really
can't<00:02:05.969> even<00:02:06.030> move<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.630> grow<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
can't even move because they grow so

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.080 
can't even move because they grow so
large<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.590> their<00:02:07.890> legs<00:02:08.160> cannot<00:02:08.610> support

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
large that their legs cannot support

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
large that their legs cannot support
their<00:02:09.330> weight<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.319> sit<00:02:10.530> there<00:02:10.679> on

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
their weight so they just sit there on

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.240 
their weight so they just sit there on
their<00:02:11.129> poop<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> then<00:02:11.879> they
