00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.280
 The workshop is not much better 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.829
 the 33 year old with his brother it 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.420

 today he has nine employees two 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.949
 branches where a lot happens 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.809
 are 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.909
 we have already experienced scenes that is 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.799
 sometimes incomprehensible when we are 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.659
 then any 15 year old girl 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.219
 we can not say your phone 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.680
 save more and they will be gone too 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.649
 So that's about to be set if 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.239
 man the death of pet folklore 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:21.440
 thomas vogel is still well prepared 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:23.000
 he has only a small problem batteries 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.709
 technician josef mader already many 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.340
 seen because he works since theirs 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.840
 founding in the workshop 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.299
 we are now doing a battery exchange here 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.429
 at a iphone 5 the first 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.679
 work steps are in the bottom of the 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.910
 to loosen both housing screws 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.869
 so that you can remove the display synonymous 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.369
 Your customers need their data 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.110
 By the way, do not worry 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.410
 they stay with the repair so far 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.929
 so it's mostly possible they are 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.700
 actually display quite classic device 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.769
 falls on the floor display is 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.099
 bound 

00:01:53.769 --> 00:02:01.239
 followed by water damage fluids 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.239
 and battery 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.690
 The experts repair the apple brands 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.730
 and samsung at the best too 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.160
 sold 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.190
 If the housing screws then removed 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.920
 are on the device ideally is one 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.230
 Suction cup around the display then out of the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.700
 to lift housing and helps with such a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:31.810
 slide to the whole then just closed 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:34.180
 solve and then the device is open 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.790
 then unscrew four screws 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.069
 because of the battery smartphone repair 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.239
 is not a siemens education professional and 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.660
 his team have everything themselves 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.660
 taught 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.220
 Well then we have the new battery here 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.890
 they always arrive partially loaded 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.269
 that means he has a certain foundation 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.810
 so that the device is the same then 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.810
 can use again 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.379
 depending on the damage 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.670
 the repair is between 39 and 200 euros 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.150
 The customers usually have to wait a long time 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.849
 not on her device in the cut for the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.220
 common devices if the spare part 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.780
 is besieged there is a repair 30 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.890
 minutes to one hour approximately 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.420
 if you prefer to repair your mobile phone yourself 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.430
 wants to get in the online shop of 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.690
 Workshop also spare parts many 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.459
 instructions are available at youtube 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.459
 or ifixit come point 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.390
 the technical easy on the devices 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.680
 that just again, that you just 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.150
 that fixes that one again 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.709
 also feasible 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.800
 Challenges stand that the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.600
 problems and it is great 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.770
 working environment with us by that times 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.730
 somehow are so friendly 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.540
 loose atmosphere still relatively small it 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.100
 means one can also own 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.270
 making decisions is flexible and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.270
 It's a lot of fun
