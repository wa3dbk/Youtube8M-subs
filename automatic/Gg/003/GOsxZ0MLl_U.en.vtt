00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:09.740
 Hello everyone, and then after the letters the second video 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.599
 on your replay, well, I have not fully 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 watched everything that you sent though not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.680
 so much as it would seem 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.680
 damn it could be much worse 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 I’m not quite cope yet 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.910
 of the week we will finish a couple more vidosikov we 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.939
 let's write down a video about the lion I already have 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.960
 rolling it even has but further 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.910
 let's see but this is a fight for me 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 interesting because there will be tanking 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.410
 on e100 the date may be some not 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.620
 correct choices of something but how are you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.480
 I know, in principle, the stretch is not very in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.610
 principle generally not very punitive 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 started stretching and the like so now 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.960
 often roll out e100 but not tank 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 Were able only against everybody 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 I can do it and here I was 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.519
 interesting to see what happens or 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.270
 wrong thin this paradox seemed 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.250
 I think I should do everything right 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.400
 current already played in this game but 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.690
 still still gaming 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.860
 Aleshin how well here and this group well, 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:26.540
 by the way apparently the fillings are constant 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.180
 i'll be a great shot aa rye in 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.300
 the correct inscription here is highlighted 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.850
 constantly viewer channel on twitch and this 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.770
 consider this idea and by the way he spoke 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.070
 same rights as all of you 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.260
 but here handsome too will be the beginning 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.050
 I'm straight, I feel like I'm 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.330
 I play to seven shot but seven still 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.340
 Type of meet very interesting 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.250
 tank ie before you play on 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.440
 tank and address it is also like me 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.700
 draw conclusions 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.410
 before you play the tank need a little 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.380
 it would look at the video now for 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.000
 at least this 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.690
 you can do it here 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.030
 and up to every possible accounting the end is a lot 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.819
 just so I could see the video already 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 can draw any conclusions 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.859
 and I really need to because 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.469
 you want to learn to play something 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.090
 wanted to see and 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:21.459
 good but here for a long time to hide the corpse 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.689
 Of course it is a strange way it operates 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.209
 whether he did not notice t57 something else but 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.489
 in general, now 57 will begin to distribute to him 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.200
 Here you are, you can do the same 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.750
 It was to do for the pipe, it seems to me 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.659
 more interesting for you can not super cool 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.969
 dude but it's great to eat like that 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.969
 her that yes it is nonsense camera is removed 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:52.569
 57 rare cretins seemed to come on 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.699
 more often as he drove interestingly you have 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.430
 there probably already played and you know what 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.650
 we like to make a bit more weight 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.569
 I was like a wild, apparently doing like 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.370
 makes mars sometime my sin 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.799
 friend did so you yourself turned away 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.659
 shirt and go as if I am you 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.659
 showing the camera to the camera then poke out 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.810
 the situation is that here we are 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.510
 look like he is that anka and then 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.489
 he has a tower he does not turn away too 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.950
 he turns her in that direction a little 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.120
 sigh that is how I would not know 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.120
 there will be a lesson for me 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.890
 there were pictures of course not vile plays 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.630
 on paper I look yes we'll speed up here 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.959
 that is, the main point would be 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.970
 precisely in tanking here damn well and 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.790
 I do not have a lot to learn from him, I Jarosz 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.280
 watched this video replay itself 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.980
 such a brush just drives and shoots 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.060
 there is nothing supernatural here 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.190
 piece of paper up to seven grandmother 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.220
 that is, it is most likely a video after all 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.420
 for me here and drying shmalyay and here 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.519
 there will be an incomprehensible choice now 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.299
 priorities and I should think and drying 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:08.680
 I wanted to throw in the gold 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:11.500
 praise gold when drying from of course 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.950
 and and try what after this video I 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.070
 show you how I tanked sediments into this 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.350
 seen on stream 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.169
 Stream recording is also on Tube but 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.630
 I'll take a look and make a threat 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.180
 look why decides to shoot 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.490
 seven though there shrinkage 169 hepe of course 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.039
 maybe he doesn't want to take himself but 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.039
 Yet well it covers all birochkoy 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.070
 lucky 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.560
 great shot and this is 3. will not enter 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.750
 the best replays are washi that's fucking them because 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.690
 that he is here as the bottom and sued but 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.980
 Here it is , it turns out so here it is necessary 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.870
 towers do and don't know how much and 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.150
 write us productively under the video 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.410
 rules so did not correctly can 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.570
 be like something really different 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:09.400
 tank but here 430 is the best tank war 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:11.050
 It will be very long to stand on the replay that 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.520
 would like to add something 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:20.110
 dosnam we are all your replays domenem 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.050
 and then choose the best of them and he already 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.490
 will compete with the following 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.720
 the elect will be there for sure 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.310
 soviet tyaz there german costs and accident 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.940
 so whether to send the battle now is not worth 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.830
 It is worth being limited a little that is how 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.600
 supporting this week finish there 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.580
 video at least postpone video can 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.380
 we have an extra day will end once and Wait 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.030
 day i will make an announcement we will 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.600
 watch other replays you'll 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.080
 send 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.260
 so send replays to t32 when i 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:55.060
 I ask the German tyazhe not worth it like this 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:58.660
 I will wait 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.669
 wait and do not play we are pigeons but more 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.630
 than 8000 though I shot of course not super 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.370
 steep 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.440
 the fight itself turned out but I liked 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.980
 precisely tanking but he also played his 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:14.080
 role if not for him then fig bridge 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:17.900
 For me, 8 500 damage is generally one 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:23.570
 one of the best moments of life here 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.370
 battle then your replays wait hope 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.610
 everything would be fine with you was in the fall 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.610
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:35.030
