00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.340
 apple changed the design now we have 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.090
 nothing is written on top all very 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.460
 succinctly but judging by this contour can be seen 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.470
 what size will the phone be 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.629
 do tradition neatly 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.140
 we open it with a pen 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.620
 I even studied the domain I get 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.809
 do it like this without fear of taking this 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.220
 film and here it is here it is the moment of truth 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:52.760
 here it is now carefully got out yes 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.769
 mean age iphone here apple 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.680
 made by mind to order neatly 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.390
 I could not get it off 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.070
 say that he began to hold in his hand 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.869
 much worse or is there something like that 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.760
 normalities at least in my hand 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.900
 here they do not know how it will be about 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.460
 models 6 plus we will check enough 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 comfortable due to rounded edges 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.950
 which here are many a number of frame this 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.930
 the film she became double well well 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.460
 naturally the diagonal was four inches 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.490
 it became 47 nothing surprising if we 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.789
 will compare the thickness of it was another 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 thinner i.e. iphone 6 is thinner than 500 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.049
 5s was already thin but not really there 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.280
 there is no normal if we compare 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.600
 phone and back means 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.480
 the camera is still here double flash 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 work he which gives us white light and 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.710
 the yellow light the camera got better 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.170
 the apple is made of liquid metal so 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.320
 called material which is separate 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.940
 socket so now it's not easy 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 the surface is so silvered and the whole 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.040
 the whole part of this part which can 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.020
 understand separately disassemble now not 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.290
 will the power button be moved sideways 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.730
 let's turn that in the box in 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.280
 a box given to us such a gun for 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.990
 which can raise and all the documentation 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.610
 necessary and most important that we have 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.100
 There is an adapter for a European outlet 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.160
 and immediately we have cable lighting 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.960
 which has absolutely not changed since the past 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.020
 the version is like there was karen likes well and 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.180
 stayed and we have airpods headphones 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.930
 which were presented in 2012 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.880
 maybe it's some kind of cooler 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.830
 revision maybe they will sound louder 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.840
 I do not know everything we will check you all 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.720
 the game world 1 anboxing first impression 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.660
 she did not show the most important thing 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.080
 it is here in this little neat 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.500
 little book is the same needle 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.050
 which you can get a sim card and our 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.130
 pocket 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.340
 instructions in different languages ​​that 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.560
 is a 6 iphone like them 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.840
 use and two big stickers 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.910
 stickers become more power button 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.680
 moved to the side this is very 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.600
 convenient because here in the hand lies like 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.489
 I just need to get on the screen to me 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.350
 just press it in principle 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.370
 normal evolution for the phone is what 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.959
 on top now there is nothing well everything 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.660
 Anboxing itself on this we will finish the most 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.760
 the main thing is that the iphone 6 is now in Krasnodar 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.320
 and we will tell about your impressions 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.320
 necessarily in the next video
