00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.519 

this<00:00:15.240> test<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.430> JRA<00:00:17.430> ultimate<00:00:18.420> tests<00:00:18.810> for

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
this test is the JRA ultimate tests for

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.560 
this test is the JRA ultimate tests for
just<00:00:19.560> riding<00:00:20.070> along<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.119> simulates

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
just riding along and what it simulates

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
just riding along and what it simulates
is<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:23.300> massive<00:00:24.380> jump<00:00:25.380> casing<00:00:26.099> where<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> fork

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is a massive jump casing where the fork

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.900 
is a massive jump casing where the fork
would<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.180> driven<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:29.340> side<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
would be driven into the side of the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
would be driven into the side of the
jump<00:00:30.090> where<00:00:30.269> you're<00:00:30.390> coming<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.689> short<00:00:31.340> so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
jump where you're coming up short so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
jump where you're coming up short so
what<00:00:32.520> we're<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> we're<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.660 
what we're going to do is we're going to
basically<00:00:34.020> try<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.620> crush<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> bike<00:00:35.460> by

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
basically try and crush the bike by

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
basically try and crush the bike by
pushing<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.270> bottom<00:00:37.200> bracket<00:00:37.590> toward<00:00:38.040> the

front axle with a totally rigid
unbendable<00:00:42.450> fork<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.410> we're<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> try

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
unbendable fork now we're going to try

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
unbendable fork now we're going to try
and<00:00:43.980> crush<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> bike<00:00:44.640> frame<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.840> see

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and crush the bike frame and and see

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.580 
and crush the bike frame and and see
what<00:00:46.140> happens

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.310 
and the frame here instead of going and
pulling<00:01:19.830> something<00:01:20.250> brand-new<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> stock

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
pulling something brand-new out of stock

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.179 
pulling something brand-new out of stock
we're<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> take<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> frame<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> two

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
we're going to take a frame that two

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
we're going to take a frame that two
years<00:01:23.400> ago<00:01:23.610> went<00:01:24.540> through<00:01:24.750> two<00:01:24.930> different

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
years ago went through two different

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
years ago went through two different
fatigue<00:01:25.500> tests<00:01:25.740> those<00:01:25.890> two<00:01:26.159> hundred<00:01:26.220> thousand

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
fatigue tests those two hundred thousand

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
fatigue tests those two hundred thousand
cycles<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.479> fatigue<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.439> impact

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
cycles of fatigue then it was impact

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.440 
cycles of fatigue then it was impact
tested<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.610> different<00:01:29.880> tests<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.240> didn't

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
tested on two different tests and didn't

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
tested on two different tests and didn't
break<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.549> ridden<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.060> two

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
break and then it was ridden for two

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.740 
break and then it was ridden for two
years<00:01:33.509> by<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:33.990> employee<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.390> he<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
years by an employee and he just got a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.090 
years by an employee and he just got a
new<00:01:36.900> frame<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.530> we're<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> throw<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
new frame so we're going to throw it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.560 
new frame so we're going to throw it
back<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> test<00:01:38.700> machine<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> actually

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
back on the test machine and actually

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
back on the test machine and actually
smash<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.350> time<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.820> see<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.090> about

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
smash at this time so see what all about

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
smash at this time so see what all about
abuse<00:01:42.689> leaves<00:01:43.110> us<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:48.590> 456<00:01:49.590> ninety<00:01:52.130> nine

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:51.390 

aluminium<00:03:31.489> broke<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.940> laughs

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.520 

more<00:03:52.400> weight<00:03:52.580> yeah<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.510> think<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.140> should<00:03:54.320> leave

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
more weight yeah I think we should leave

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.740 
more weight yeah I think we should leave
it<00:03:54.590> although<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.820> spends<00:03:56.210> bike<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:56.570> maybe

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
it although it is spends bike so maybe

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.250 
it although it is spends bike so maybe
we<00:03:56.840> should<00:03:56.870> break<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.910> we<00:03:59.210> just<00:03:59.450> did<00:03:59.720> double

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
we should break it so we just did double

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.400 
we should break it so we just did double
the<00:04:00.560> height<00:04:00.970> on<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.270> carbon<00:04:02.720> dome<00:04:02.870> at<00:04:03.020> the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
the height on the carbon dome at the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.790 
the height on the carbon dome at the
aluminum<00:04:04.220> one<00:04:04.940> started<00:04:05.390> breaking<00:04:05.750> around<00:04:06.110> 450

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
aluminum one started breaking around 450

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.770 
aluminum one started breaking around 450
and<00:04:07.600> then<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.720> just<00:04:09.050> buckled<00:04:09.590> as<00:04:09.740> we<00:04:09.890> hitted<00:04:10.340> it

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and then it just buckled as we hitted it

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.630 
and then it just buckled as we hitted it
600<00:04:11.780> after<00:04:11.990> that<00:04:12.140> this<00:04:12.620> one<00:04:13.130> just<00:04:13.370> went<00:04:13.459> up<00:04:13.580> to

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
600 after that this one just went up to

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.509 
600 after that this one just went up to
900<00:04:14.510> millimeters<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.740> it's<00:04:15.920> just<00:04:16.040> bouncing

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
900 millimeters and it's just bouncing

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.370 
900 millimeters and it's just bouncing
so<00:04:16.970> it's<00:04:17.120> no<00:04:17.239> surprise<00:04:17.390> fan<00:04:17.930> couldn't<00:04:18.230> break

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
so it's no surprise fan couldn't break

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.349 
so it's no surprise fan couldn't break
it<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:19.340> we<00:04:19.430> could<00:04:19.579> add<00:04:19.700> some<00:04:19.730> more<00:04:19.940> weight<00:04:20.150> and

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
it but we could add some more weight and

00:04:20.359 --> 00:05:06.220 
it but we could add some more weight and
see<00:04:20.540> what<00:04:20.660> happens<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:03.050> got<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.260> a<00:05:03.560> cement
