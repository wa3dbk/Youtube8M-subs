from back there these probably look like
Astra<00:00:23.340> 400s<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.779> there's<00:00:24.960> good<00:00:25.109> reason<00:00:25.410> for

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
Astra 400s and there's good reason for

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.590 
Astra 400s and there's good reason for
that<00:00:25.590> these<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.160> fact<00:00:26.189> copies<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.210> Astra

that these are in fact copies of Astra
for<00:00:27.810> hundreds<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:29.070> makes<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.460> both<00:00:29.550> very

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
for hundreds what makes them both very

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.570 
for hundreds what makes them both very
interesting<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:30.930> were<00:00:31.580> anarchist

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
interesting is that they were anarchist

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.820

some from countries like Russia but they
did<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.109> to<00:02:01.200> manufacture<00:02:01.799> some<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.159> their

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
did want to manufacture some of their

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.279 
did want to manufacture some of their
own<00:02:02.429> or<00:02:02.609> at<00:02:02.700> least<00:02:02.850> try<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.840> set<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
own or at least try to so they set up a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.889 
own or at least try to so they set up a
couple<00:02:04.499> of<00:02:04.710> manufacturing<00:02:05.369> facilities<00:02:05.909> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
couple of manufacturing facilities and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
couple of manufacturing facilities and
they<00:02:07.439> tried<00:02:07.710> producing<00:02:08.220> some<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.490> their<00:02:08.610> own

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
they tried producing some of their own

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
they tried producing some of their own
guns<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:10.050> probably<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.590> two<00:02:10.769> most

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
guns and these are probably the two most

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
guns and these are probably the two most
common<00:02:11.430> examples<00:02:11.940> they're<00:02:12.569> both<00:02:12.750> copies<00:02:13.019> of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
common examples they're both copies of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.860 
common examples they're both copies of
the<00:02:13.379> Astra<00:02:13.709> 400<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.400> had<00:02:14.610> been<00:02:14.730> adopted<00:02:15.269> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the Astra 400 that had been adopted in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.530 
the Astra 400 that had been adopted in
18:21<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.890> standard<00:02:17.430> Spanish<00:02:18.209> army

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
18:21 is the standard Spanish army

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.780 
18:21 is the standard Spanish army
pistol<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:19.890> made<00:02:20.129> sense<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.519> use

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
pistol and so it just made sense to use

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.570 
pistol and so it just made sense to use
it<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:22.080> well<00:02:22.319> these<00:02:22.470> are<00:02:22.650> both<00:02:22.860> copies<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
it so well these are both copies of the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.190 
it so well these are both copies of the
Astra<00:02:23.879> 400<00:02:24.390> they<00:02:24.480> were<00:02:24.540> made<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.019> different

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.960 
Casso so why don't I bring the camera
back<00:02:34.829> here<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.099> let's<00:02:35.220> take<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> closer<00:02:35.760> look

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
back here and let's take a closer look

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.000 
back here and let's take a closer look
at<00:02:36.120> both<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.420> these<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.870> learn<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> little<00:02:37.769> bit

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
at both of these and learn a little bit

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.470 
at both of these and learn a little bit
about<00:02:38.159> their<00:02:38.370> production<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.000> what<00:02:39.299> worked

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
about their production and what worked

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.899 
about their production and what worked
and<00:02:39.599> what<00:02:39.780> didn't<00:02:40.110> we'll<00:02:41.099> start<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.640> with

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
and what didn't we'll start here with
