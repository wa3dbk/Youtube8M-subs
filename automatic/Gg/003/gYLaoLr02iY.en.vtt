00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
up at the end there is the important

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.570 
up at the end there is the important
point<00:01:23.250> luxury<00:01:23.670> suites<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:25.400> pretty<00:01:26.400> much

why<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.229> Coliseum<00:01:28.229> was<00:01:28.410> imploded<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> make

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
why that Coliseum was imploded to make

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300 
why that Coliseum was imploded to make
way<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.490> more<00:01:29.850> luxury<00:01:30.300> boxes<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.979> saved<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
way for more luxury boxes they saved a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
way for more luxury boxes they saved a
lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.490> time<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.910> money<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.180> imploding<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lot of time and money and imploding the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.840 
lot of time and money and imploding the
Omni<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:35.160> because<00:01:35.400> tearing<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> down

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
Omni actually because tearing it down

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.130 
Omni actually because tearing it down
evidently<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.690> taken<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.020> six

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
evidently would have taken about six

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
evidently would have taken about six
months<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.680> would<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> cost<00:01:38.009> four<00:01:38.220> times<00:01:38.430> as

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
months and would it cost four times as

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.120 
months and would it cost four times as
much<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:39.660> say<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.800> easiest

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
much they say so this was the easiest

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.070 
much they say so this was the easiest
and<00:01:41.490> most<00:01:41.520> efficient<00:01:42.149> cost<00:01:42.450> efficient<00:01:42.869> way<00:01:42.899> of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
and most efficient cost efficient way of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.169 
and most efficient cost efficient way of
doing<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.520> scary<00:01:44.880> for

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
doing it but it was a little scary for

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.700 
doing it but it was a little scary for
us<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.690> CNN<00:01:45.869> Center<00:01:46.319> it<00:01:46.410> felt<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.619> an

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
us here at CNN Center it felt like an

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
us here at CNN Center it felt like an
earthquake<00:01:46.800> second<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.880> tell<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
earthquake second I can tell you that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
earthquake second I can tell you that
folks<00:01:48.869> who<00:01:48.990> will<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.259> outside<00:01:49.740> there<00:01:50.069> right

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
folks who will be outside there right

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
folks who will be outside there right
now<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.729> getting<00:01:50.940> quite<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:52.190> mouthful

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
now would be getting quite a mouthful

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.029 
now would be getting quite a mouthful
wouldn't<00:01:54.300> they<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:55.200> no<00:01:55.530> wonder<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.890> don't

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
wouldn't they it's no wonder they don't

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.950 
wouldn't they it's no wonder they don't
encourage<00:01:56.399> people<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.940> come<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.630> see

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
encourage people to come down and see

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.510 
encourage people to come down and see
these<00:01:58.140> things<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.560> wondering<00:01:58.830> if<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.100> see

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
these things I'm wondering if we can see

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.460 
these things I'm wondering if we can see
some<00:01:59.670> replays<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.569> because<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
some replays to this and because it

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.800 
some replays to this and because it
happened<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.950> quickly<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.660> we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
happened so quickly and there I think we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.859 
happened so quickly and there I think we
do<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.160> suicide<00:02:05.940> cam<00:02:06.300> tape<00:02:06.630> which

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
do have the suicide cam tape which

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.600 
do have the suicide cam tape which
they're<00:02:07.050> currently<00:02:07.410> getting<00:02:07.920> ready<00:02:08.250> for

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
they're currently getting ready for

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.540 
they're currently getting ready for
viewing<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> viewing<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.740> don't<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.459> how

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
viewing for the viewing I don't know how

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.770 
viewing for the viewing I don't know how
much<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.850> saw<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.240> it<00:02:12.360> though<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> think<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
much we saw in it though I think it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.059 
much we saw in it though I think it
pretty<00:02:12.990> much<00:02:13.080> went<00:02:13.350> out<00:02:13.440> went<00:02:13.709> particulate

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
pretty much went out went particulate

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.260 
pretty much went out went particulate
yeah<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:16.380> pretty<00:02:16.620> much<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.120> is

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
yeah and it pretty much I think that is

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.780 
yeah and it pretty much I think that is
a<00:02:18.300> shot<00:02:18.660> well<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> cloudy<00:02:19.980> day<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.370> Atlanta

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
a shot well it's a cloudy day in Atlanta

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.340 
a shot well it's a cloudy day in Atlanta
so<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> little<00:02:21.330> bit<00:02:21.420> hard<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
so it's a little bit hard to not that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.980 
so it's a little bit hard to not that
cloudy<00:02:22.590> though<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.830> don't<00:02:23.010> think<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.990> anyway

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
cloudy though I don't think but anyway

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.440 
cloudy though I don't think but anyway

we have it apparently so

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.100 
we have it apparently so
I<00:02:36.250> see<00:02:36.700> them<00:02:36.850> cueing<00:02:37.270> away<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:37.810> we're<00:02:38.020> gonna

morning<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.050> could<00:03:11.140> talk<00:03:11.290> about<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.650> too<00:03:11.920> but

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
morning we could talk about that too but

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.780 
morning we could talk about that too but

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140

and<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.230> didn't<00:03:31.500> look<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:32.100> but

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and it didn't look like this but

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.040 
and it didn't look like this but
supposedly<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.270> ceiling<00:03:33.660> was<00:03:33.810> supposed<00:03:34.020> to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
supposedly the ceiling was supposed to

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
supposedly the ceiling was supposed to
be<00:03:34.170> dropped<00:03:34.410> first<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.740> didn't<00:03:34.950> look<00:03:35.010> like

be dropped first it didn't look like
that's<00:03:35.370> how<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.670> happened<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.420> there<00:03:37.020> was<00:03:37.140> a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
that's how it happened but there was a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.340 
that's how it happened but there was a
distinct<00:03:37.940> series<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.060> explosions<00:03:39.390> one<00:03:40.050> to

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
distinct series of explosions one to

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.670 
distinct series of explosions one to
seed<00:03:41.160> drop<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.820> those<00:03:42.060> columns<00:03:42.570> right<00:03:42.930> then

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
seed drop out those columns right then

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.320 
seed drop out those columns right then
there<00:03:43.830> was<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> series<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.310> explosions<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.970> take

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
there was a series of explosions to take

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.180 
there was a series of explosions to take
the<00:03:45.450> ceiling<00:03:45.840> down<00:03:46.020> well<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.530> well<00:03:46.800> who<00:03:46.980> and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
the ceiling down well that well who and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.630 
the ceiling down well that well who and
then<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> wall<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.870> walls<00:03:49.140> were<00:03:50.040> supposed<00:03:50.490> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
then the wall the walls were supposed to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.180 
then the wall the walls were supposed to
fall<00:03:51.180> inward<00:03:51.570> on<00:03:51.660> there<00:03:52.020> we<00:03:52.230> are<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.070> we

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
fall inward on there we are and there we

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.479 
fall inward on there we are and there we
are<00:03:53.220> -<00:03:53.370> there<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:55.080> corner<00:03:55.470> shot<00:03:55.739> waving<00:03:56.340> out

can<00:04:11.110> go<00:04:11.200> take<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.440> look<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.860> see<00:04:12.040> if<00:04:12.190> there's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
can go take a look and see if there's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.640 
can go take a look and see if there's
any<00:04:13.270> damage<00:04:13.480> sustained<00:04:13.959> here<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.319> building

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
any damage sustained here the building

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
did shake quite a bit yes it did it

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.270 
did shake quite a bit yes it did it
really<00:04:16.959> did<00:04:17.200> there<00:04:17.739> was<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.889> lot<00:04:18.040> of<00:04:18.070> vibration

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
really did there was a lot of vibration

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.220 
really did there was a lot of vibration
there<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:18.880> some<00:04:19.030> glass<00:04:19.299> behind<00:04:19.690> us<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.079> that

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
there is some glass behind us and that

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.010 
there is some glass behind us and that
shook<00:04:20.470> quite<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.739> bit<00:04:21.150> well<00:04:22.150> but<00:04:22.750> then<00:04:22.870> this

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
shook quite a bit well but then this

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.360 
shook quite a bit well but then this
building<00:04:23.350> shakes<00:04:23.590> when<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.860> trains<00:04:24.160> roll

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
building shakes when the trains roll

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.820 
building shakes when the trains roll
underneath<00:04:24.790> -<00:04:25.060> sometimes<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.080> know<00:04:26.200> and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
underneath - sometimes so you know and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.050 
underneath - sometimes so you know and
then<00:04:26.980> we're<00:04:27.100> gonna<00:04:27.220> be<00:04:27.400> looking<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.730> think<00:04:27.850> at<00:04:28.000> a

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
then we're gonna be looking I think at a

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.720 
then we're gonna be looking I think at a
pile<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.270> rubble<00:04:28.780> for<00:04:29.250> well<00:04:30.250> cleaned<00:04:30.550> up

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
pile of rubble for well cleaned up

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.340 
pile of rubble for well cleaned up
rubble<00:04:31.060> maybe<00:04:31.240> for<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.540> while<00:04:31.750> because<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.230> new

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
rubble maybe for a while because the new

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.930 
rubble maybe for a while because the new
arena<00:04:32.620> is<00:04:32.800> not<00:04:32.950> scheduled<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.400> open<00:04:33.669> until<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
arena is not scheduled to open until the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.480 
arena is not scheduled to open until the
fall<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.740> 1999<00:04:35.740> yes<00:04:36.520> so<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.419> Hawks<00:04:37.690> will

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
fall of 1999 yes so the the Hawks will

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.370 
fall of 1999 yes so the the Hawks will
the<00:04:39.490> Hawks<00:04:39.700> will<00:04:39.880> be<00:04:39.970> playing<00:04:40.270> at<00:04:41.020> both

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
the Hawks will be playing at both

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.460 
the Hawks will be playing at both
Georgia<00:04:41.980> Tech's<00:04:42.370> facility<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:44.260> some

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
Georgia Tech's facility and in some

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.060 
Georgia Tech's facility and in some
cases<00:04:44.680> at<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.190> Dome<00:04:45.460> which<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:45.880> right
