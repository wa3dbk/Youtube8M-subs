detail so to get the most extreme
overclocks<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> card<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:07.080> need

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
overclocks on the card we actually need

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.859 
overclocks on the card we actually need
to<00:01:07.380> deliver<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.920> power<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> GPU<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.720> on

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to deliver more power to the GPU so on

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
to deliver more power to the GPU so on
our<00:01:10.020> new<00:01:10.170> toxic<00:01:10.650> model<00:01:10.950> we've<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.610> got

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
our new toxic model we've actually got

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179 
our new toxic model we've actually got
not<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.780> digital<00:01:13.110> power<00:01:13.350> control<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.040> we've

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
not just digital power control but we've

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.880 
not just digital power control but we've
got<00:01:14.430> eight<00:01:15.090> phase--<00:01:15.420> power<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> GPU<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
got eight phase-- power for the GPU and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.710 
got eight phase-- power for the GPU and
additional<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.729> phases<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.270> power<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.630> the

additional two phases of power for the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
additional two phases of power for the
memory<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.740> deliver<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> maximum

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
memory so we can deliver the maximum

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.640

the power section is maintained at a
cool<00:01:25.770> level<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.460> we're<00:01:26.640> using<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:27.090> sefa

exclusive<00:01:28.560> diamond<00:01:29.009> chokes<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.210> also

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
exclusive diamond chokes and we also

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.510 
exclusive diamond chokes and we also
have<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.020> whole<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.590> solid<00:01:31.860> capacitors<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
have a whole lot of solid capacitors and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.490 
have a whole lot of solid capacitors and
other<00:01:32.700> components<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.689> designed<00:01:34.350> to

other components in there designed to
maintain<00:01:34.650> high<00:01:35.100> reliability<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> higher

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
maintain high reliability so the higher

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
maintain high reliability so the higher
we<00:01:36.780> take<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> clocks<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.369> heat<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
we take the clocks the more heat is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
we take the clocks the more heat is
going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.090> generated<00:01:39.240> by<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> GPU<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to be generated by the GPU so the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.859 
going to be generated by the GPU so the
next<00:01:41.490> thing<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.759> need<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> achieve<00:01:42.240> maximum

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
next thing we need to achieve maximum

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
next thing we need to achieve maximum
performance<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.860> highly<00:01:44.250> efficient<00:01:44.640> cooler

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
performance is a highly efficient cooler

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
performance is a highly efficient cooler
and<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:45.540> we've<00:01:45.689> done<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.170> toxic

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and what we've done with this toxic

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.340 
and what we've done with this toxic
model<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.100> we're<00:01:48.000> using<00:01:48.360> 10<00:01:48.630> millimeter<00:01:49.140> heat

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
industry-first for sapphire we're going

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
industry-first for sapphire we're going
to<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> maximum<00:01:53.880> amount<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.240> heat<00:01:54.299> away

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
