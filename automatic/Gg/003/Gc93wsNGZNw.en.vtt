00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.689
 if you come in from the outside then 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.219
 the walls are almost dark 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.669
 blackish dark gray you get there 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:35.640
 within orphan you see a wealth of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.409
 all sails and beautiful seats and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.409
 a beautiful indoor environment 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.920
 this glass music hall was an attempt to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.080
 to make their total glass box and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.700
 acoustic to be redeemed are acoustic 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.070
 fish tank 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.790
 so that if music was made here 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.420
 that no noise was heard from 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.420
 the balconies 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:14.210
 be echo time is in a bare room 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.550
 five seconds and with these features 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 this field is that, after a point two 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.490
 seconds gone what an excellent acoustics 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.700
 and gives it special for you 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.840
 such a hard material as glass is one 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.280
 fantastic 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.470
 acoustic environment can makes the core 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.990
 of the invention is the way the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.660
 lower glass plates via a node 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.440
 with a boat on the outside and that 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.570
 stripping 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.580
 the top node we go 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.260
 then those forces through this stick 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.260
 in a kind of craftsmanship from 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.860
 very thin 8 mm thin steel bars 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.860
 they are thus hung on the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 upper the construction at the top and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.600
 especially about pressure 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.840
 leaning architects therefore a horizontal one 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.030
 This construction is excellent under load 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.680
 suitable he is so thin that we 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.720
 initially he thought a bit 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.850
 too vulnerable they are but even after 25 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.519
 he had no damage for years 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.080
 sit was a very in those days 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.480
 experimental construction 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.520
 unfortunately unfortunately the management of the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.320
 Berlage Fair despite decided to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.480
 to have him removed 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.340
 this requires a larger installation 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.040
 a convention center can be built 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.370
 which I find very unfortunate so I stand 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.040
 somewhat sorry in my body here too 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.500
 look at what I consider to be one 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.630
 design baby where would I think it would be a shame 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.520
 like that in a month apart 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.140
 would be met and to the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.180
 scrap heap would disappear 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.180
 so if anything about it in maastricht 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.350
 tilburg again groningen or in 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.330
 Amsterdam still needs one 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.120
 lecture hall at the universities 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.610
 we keep our recommended the problem 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.530
 just that you are a very big one 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.510
 outdoor space and need one if 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.170
 build up interior space 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.170
 he is worth it 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.819
 Peter Saren died when we got one 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.819
 of the glass panels 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.469
 signature and then the agreement was that 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.760
 if i ever die i would have one too 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:31.120
 signature our driving 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.120
 that is fortunately the paper goes
