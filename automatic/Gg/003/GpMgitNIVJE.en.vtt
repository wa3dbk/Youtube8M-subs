00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this just below those holes so that I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
this just below those holes so that I
can<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.710> cleaned<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.220> drill<00:00:29.789> new<00:00:29.970> holes

that<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> ordered<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> new<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.730> just

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that so I ordered a new one just

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
that so I ordered a new one just
Universal<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.629> may<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.290> cutting

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
Universal one I may have to be cutting

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.660 
Universal one I may have to be cutting
it<00:00:43.649> down<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:45.230> packing<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.670> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it down just a little bit packing in and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.799 
it down just a little bit packing in and
I<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:49.190> put<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.250> into<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> new<00:00:50.579> rivets<00:00:50.969> put<00:00:51.719> in

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I will put it into the new rivets put in

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
I will put it into the new rivets put in
the<00:00:51.899> tip<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.829> should<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.699> good<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the tip and it should be good to go I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
the tip and it should be good to go I
think<00:00:54.539> everything<00:00:55.260> should<00:00:55.289> work<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
think everything should work out so I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.580 
think everything should work out so I
taped<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.520> along<00:00:56.910> where<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.210> gonna<00:00:57.329> be

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
taped this along where I'm gonna be

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.420 
taped this along where I'm gonna be
cutting<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.129> end<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.010> yeah<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
cutting off the end of that and yeah so

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
cutting off the end of that and yeah so
see<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> works<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
see how it works out all right so I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
see how it works out all right so I
finished<00:01:04.739> off<00:01:04.979> cutting<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.180> off<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:07.080> already

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
finished off cutting this off I already

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
finished off cutting this off I already
threw<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> piece<00:01:07.979> away<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> don't<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
threw the piece away so I don't have it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
threw the piece away so I don't have it
over<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.140> looks<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.439> good<00:01:10.680> guys

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
smooth it out a bit and then just sanded

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
smooth it out a bit and then just sanded
it<00:01:21.960> by<00:01:22.080> hand<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> inside<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.820> tested<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it by hand on the inside and I tested it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.370 
it by hand on the inside and I tested it
out<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> tip<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.170> see

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
out with the the tip so as you can see

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
out with the the tip so as you can see
it'll<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.740> pop<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it'll just pop in right here it's a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
it'll just pop in right here it's a
pretty<00:01:33.329> snug<00:01:33.720> which<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.049> good<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:35.280> want

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
pretty snug which is good I don't want

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
pretty snug which is good I don't want
to<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.049> works<00:01:37.259> out

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to put it in right now but it works out

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.069 
to put it in right now but it works out
guys<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.210> next<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.329> I'll<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
guys it next thing I'll have to do is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.810 
guys it next thing I'll have to do is
just<00:01:40.320> measure<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:40.920> holes<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
just measure these holes really

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
just measure these holes really
perfectly<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:44.299> drill<00:01:45.299> those<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
perfectly and drill those I think what I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.520 
perfectly and drill those I think what I
might<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:48.149> drill<00:01:48.689> new<00:01:48.930> holes<00:01:48.960> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
might do is actually drill new holes in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.300 
might do is actually drill new holes in
this<00:01:49.680> thing<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.640> tip<00:01:51.619> because<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.189> gonna

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
this thing in the tip because it's gonna

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.480 
this thing in the tip because it's gonna
be<00:01:53.520> really<00:01:54.329> hard<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.290> exact<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> if

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
be really hard to get those exact and if

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.740 
be really hard to get those exact and if
I<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:57.000> exact<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.630> just

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
I don't get them exact then I'm just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that in there I had to actually cut off

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.050 
that in there I had to actually cut off
the<00:02:47.110> end<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.410> little<00:02:47.530> bit<00:02:47.680> because<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.700> came<00:02:48.850> out

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
the end a little bit because it came out

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.310 
the end a little bit because it came out
about<00:02:50.070> an<00:02:51.070> inch<00:02:51.790> or<00:02:52.120> two<00:02:52.360> longer<00:02:53.080> than<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
about an inch or two longer than the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.800 
about an inch or two longer than the
exhaust<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.130> cut<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.400> down<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:55.690> I'm

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
exhaust was so I cut it down now I'm

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.960 
exhaust was so I cut it down now I'm
gonna<00:02:55.959> be<00:02:56.110> putting<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.950> packing<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.850> then

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
gonna be putting the packing in and then

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.820 
gonna be putting the packing in and then
getting<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.270> tip<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.600> drilling<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> holes<00:02:59.440> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
getting a tip on drilling the holes and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.410 
getting a tip on drilling the holes and
I<00:03:00.640> think<00:03:00.820> we<00:03:00.880> should<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.180> good<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.390> go

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420

I think we should be good to go
hopefully<00:03:01.959> don't<00:03:02.050> run<00:03:02.260> into<00:03:02.440> any<00:03:02.560> problems

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
masking tape to hold it together so

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.790 
masking tape to hold it together so
looks<00:03:15.850> pretty<00:03:16.030> good<00:03:16.180> yes<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.530> should<00:03:17.709> be
