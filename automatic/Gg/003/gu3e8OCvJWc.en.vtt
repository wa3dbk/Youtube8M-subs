00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 great performance for the student band of the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 Gymnasiums in jüchen in a few weeks 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 they go as an opening act of the wdr big band 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.320
 on the stage jazz with school that means 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.759
 project that has existed for two years and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 before the joint concert there are 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.059
 still a special highlight four 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.100
 professionals visit the students for tips 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.609
 give and the young musicians on the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.609
 to look at the finger 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 leonard still has time for a little one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 fun saxophone mouthpiece on the trombone 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.630
 then they stick and screw together 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.630
 what belongs together 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.969
 for the layman, this is something like 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.350
 once the lower saxophone of the larger 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.350
 now come the professionals 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 Arno is his saxophone colleague and he's right 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.420
 This is a very special day 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 known 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.190
 I think this is already a wirtin practice too 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 we may never have to measure 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.479
 great people just played together 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.130
 you still have math or history 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 but who cares? 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.540
 on a day at the jazz swing and latin 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.540
 play the main character 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.430
 Jörg Enderle leads the school band Die 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.860
 even a first place two years ago 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.049
 but won at the state competition 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.600
 direct contact with musicians from one 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.159
 recognized worldwide because that could 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.159
 once again give a whole new push 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.540
 the professionals are there 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.290
 two Germans one Dutchman and one 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.290
 American 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.730
 the wdr big band is international and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.860
 immediately full on the matter 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.060
 Now it's getting serious for the boys 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.060
 musician from munich 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.970
 what will they say the well -traveled 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.970
 professionals 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:31.690
 quick tips first hand and me 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.190
 think that gives a completely different one 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.170
 quite another if that's me 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.470
 the same think what the bda would be big 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.740
 So also do band rehearsals every day 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.900
 I always thought her profile now time 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.900
 so accurate and yes 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.670
 Of course we still have one in the end 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.019
 committee there if we are that 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.120
 there is another group 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.829
 because that sounds like that and she says then 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.049
 guys you are not together that 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.819
 you are hanging over the rhythm group 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.590
 If you come here you can hear it once 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.030
 on 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.520
 single sample each group is doing its own thing 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.360
 jens neuffer accommodates the saxophones 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.400
 his wings 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.540
 you have to play the instrument you 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.300
 you should not of the instrument 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.430
 let play and leonard arno and the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.140
 others literally suck on five 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.530
 times on the plot of the scale 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.530
 play 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.019
 with a little practice, you can get something out of it 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.030
 like you we this thing 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.680
 you can be upset and this flexibility 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.189
 you need them quite completely 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.909
 urgent 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.909
 I watch times to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:04:19.810
 yes, yes, wonderfully great too 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.560
 clarinet and then you could still there 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.260
 which enable the student a 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.330
 unique experience but also the professionals 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.220
 take something with the certainty that 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.790
 all talents are slumbering and that of 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.110
 Big band offspring gets a chance 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.340
 yes i did not have big ben in the beautiful 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.850
 I had to do it all myself 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.290
 I was a music club and there teaching 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.200
 but no joke was played there 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.520
 normal music clubs played music and 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.520
 but that was of course mine too 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.000
 i never forget that education 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.000
 belongs to me 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.660
 this afternoon the students will be out 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.900
 Certainly not forget lychen 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.750

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.930
 no matter if old or young whether amateur 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:12.300
