 Background story on this I am present 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.630

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.310
 the game has just ten euros 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.939
 So I cost directly 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.320
 slammed 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.850

 So i played sims game too 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.179

 Protected by sorcerers and today is the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.120

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.720
 The dumbest take what to choose 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.159
 yes, of course 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.180

 I have not found anybody 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.310
 I heard the xps one sells itself 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.820
 important and so above the name if 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.540
 your bosses work okay okay 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.370
 this is better juans act xd 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.450
 what does that mean I do not speak 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.160
 Italian it means whores is one 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.510
 horny type 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 okay you can leave me like that 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.420
 but okay are free image 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.860
 hopefully not as usual 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 not really hope too 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.190
 ok i think he's gone so we'll do it 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.470
 go on 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.480
 our first task could be easier 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.160
 We do not have to be two pigs 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.050
 bring back which are ausgeüxt 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.970
 who is now looking for hours at a time 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.430
 will be disappointed because the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.620
 pigs stand a meter next to the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.010
 house today elvira but also beautiful 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.800
 can do it yourself or 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.090
 now our hero juans act xd meets his 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.390
 first friends and that the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.580
 awkward buddy the spoiled 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.160
 princess butter and the blonde 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.110
 Linzer from my show I am only since 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.550
 a few minutes to play that annoying 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.290
 me already without end 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.290
 the language of the sims 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.750
 as if the text alone was not 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.850
 would have been enough and now we come 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.970
 even for the important part of the game 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.980
 The wizard exam will be tested 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.840
 from the wizard manon of course we have 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.490
 also competition and discounts and the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.380
 Captain Barney just seems to mind 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.840
 would rather do something completely different 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.920
 Can I blame him after 1 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 definitely not 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.160
 but how accurate is the wizard's exam 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.440
 how will be determined who the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.610
 The most powerful wizard here is where we are 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.490
 conjure up things 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.810
 as we fight against each other by 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.470
 we against a powerful kite 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.470
 fight 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.430
 we build houses 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.840
 that would be my first idea though 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.830
 i could conjure my house directly 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.250
 maybe build with a nice one 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.980
 terrace 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.240
 but seriously what do they have 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.040
 Developers thought so 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.390
 probably the same as others 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.160
 ea play absolutely nothing 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.540
 after the tutorial kram will finally be 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.820
 the winner announced 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.280
 to our big surprise we have 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.100
 of course win and everything from 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.930
 is now following only get worse as 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.580
 From now on, we must the inhabitants of the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.620
 help the city by giving you houses 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.450
 to build 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.130
 completely without payment 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.350
 and if that is not bad enough 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.540
 we would have to look at the material itself 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.620
 get by dismantling or doctors 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:52.000
 Trees fall but we have to do it 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.460
 there is no way around it 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.020
 house finished and what is it 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.750
 is not satisfied now he still wants 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.610
 Interior but without payment 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.710
 I will not do a reasonable job 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.930
 so the holidays we pack on the 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.419
 This will be on the cabinet floor 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.160
 another picture on the bookshelf and one 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.229
 another bed on the other bookshelf 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.820
 Incidentally, I have no idea how the 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.620
 two beds because it can stay 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.979
 but in this game I do not expect any 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.610
 Logic more so let's see what he tells us 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.729
 will say 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.760
 you have done a great job 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.960
 I am really glad that you are ours 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.960
 new city ​​carrier until seriously that was 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.640
 good work is enough for me i travel now 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.700
 maybe there is another island 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.740
 to do there meaningful 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.110
 to the nature park or in the wild 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.669
 West pretty clear decision 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.669
 in the natural park of course 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.199
 on the island we meet rené and otherwise 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.839
 no one what is our first task 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.029
 on the island right here 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.949
 Visitor Center is building the island 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.839
 can barely be in front of visitors 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:14.399
 save and how to build 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:21.719
 visitor center exactly from 25 cherries 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:23.399
 and five smileys that makes sense or that 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:27.389
 next few minutes can be described as such 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:30.389
 Be quick to register when planting 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.269
 Rip off more like cats 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.429
 collect more fish around their run 

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:38.129
 work around the bear's body and lens 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:39.929
 run now that we all materials 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.739
 it will be time the visitor center 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:42.479
 to build 

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:44.549
 and of course I will 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.119
 visitors center is also screw up again 

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:47.219
 yes, yes 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.649
 bushes within the center will open 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:52.499
 the roof simply a flower on the roof 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.459
 on the house a bear on the house and 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.049
 I think I do not need to 

00:06:53.459 --> 00:07:00.209
 mention that you too 

00:06:55.049 --> 00:07:02.969
 but we liked it 

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:06.860
 conclusion of the game is this game 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:10.669
 boring, this game is bad 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:16.669
 you should buy this game 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:16.669
 horrorfilm but karrubi 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:24.770
 He's gone because I'm here with you 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.060
 you never get but you were 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.060
 no what 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.190
 if you the video has spread to 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.720
 can you love the high part and 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.380
 hopefully you will switch next time 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.870
 again 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.450
 to my show so show onebox show 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.620
 only here in the internet destroyed 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.670
 then you have to deal with the consequences 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.840
 Life 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.840
 until then and bye
