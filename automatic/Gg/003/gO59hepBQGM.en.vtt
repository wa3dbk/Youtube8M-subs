the<00:01:54.240> girls<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:55.320> pretty<00:01:55.560> much<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.829> same

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
the girls have pretty much the same

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.490 
the girls have pretty much the same
detailing<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:57.810> currently<00:01:58.170> available

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
detailing now that's currently available

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.359 
detailing now that's currently available
so<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.329> around<00:02:01.369> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
so it's really all the way around the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.920 
so it's really all the way around the
collar<00:02:02.609> and<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> neckline<00:02:03.359> and<00:02:03.659> around

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
collar and the neckline and around

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
collar and the neckline and around
around<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.469> facing<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.340> centre<00:02:05.700> front

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
around the facing and the centre front

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.180 
around the facing and the centre front
and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.750> again<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> pockets<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.039> it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and then again on the pockets so it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.830 
and then again on the pockets so it's
just<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.430> slight<00:02:08.670> variation<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.690> nice

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just a slight variation so it's nice

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.170 
just a slight variation so it's nice
work<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.590> works<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.100> well<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.090> think

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
work it works really well and I think

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.150 
work it works really well and I think
it'll<00:02:12.450> give<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.080> each<00:02:13.350> boy<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.770> each<00:02:13.890> girl

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
it'll give it the each boy in each girl

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.830 
it'll give it the each boy in each girl
that<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:14.940> bit<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.150> distinction<00:02:15.690> which<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that little bit of distinction which is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.230 
that little bit of distinction which is
really<00:02:16.170> important

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
really important

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.610 
really important
the<00:02:19.240> most<00:02:19.450> important<00:02:20.020> thing<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.349> think<00:02:20.560> about

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the most important thing to think about

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.589 
the most important thing to think about
that<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.640> thought<00:02:21.880> about<00:02:22.000> with<00:02:22.330> early

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
that I thought about with early

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.870 
that I thought about with early
childhood<00:02:22.959> in<00:02:23.140> particular<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.550> a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
childhood in particular is to have a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.240 
childhood in particular is to have a
much<00:02:25.390> more<00:02:25.599> comfortable<00:02:25.870> less<00:02:26.830> formal

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
much more comfortable less formal

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.970 
much more comfortable less formal
approach<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.080> little<00:02:29.319> each<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.770> that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
approach for the little each so that

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.860 
approach for the little each so that
it's<00:02:30.130> easy<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:31.090> parents<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.569> put<00:02:31.720> together

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's easy for parents to put together

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.160 
it's easy for parents to put together
easy<00:02:32.349> for<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> kids<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.099> get<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.790> off<00:02:34.170> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
easy for the kids to get on and off and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.290 
easy for the kids to get on and off and
just<00:02:35.770> more<00:02:35.890> serviceable<00:02:36.459> everyday<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> play

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
extremely well I think above all I think

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.089 
extremely well I think above all I think
the<00:05:59.689> kids<00:05:59.930> are<00:06:00.050> going<00:06:00.169> to<00:06:00.229> love<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.710> wear<00:06:00.860> it
