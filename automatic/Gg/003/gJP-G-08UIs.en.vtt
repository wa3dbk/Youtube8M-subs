quick little business like this that way
you<00:04:40.199> get<00:04:40.470> only<00:04:40.680> super<00:04:41.370> solar<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.910> you're

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
you get only super solar and you're

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.150 
you get only super solar and you're
paying<00:04:42.240> each<00:04:42.570> individual<00:04:43.290> layer<00:04:43.500> not<00:04:43.830> like

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
paying each individual layer not like

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.560 
paying each individual layer not like
cutting<00:04:44.610> through<00:04:44.820> eight<00:04:45.030> different<00:04:45.240> layers

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
cutting through eight different layers

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.129 
cutting through eight different layers
and<00:04:45.840> then<00:04:45.960> we'll<00:04:46.199> discover<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.479> rivers<00:04:48.479> okay

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
and then we'll discover the rivers okay

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.040 
and then we'll discover the rivers okay
and<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.220> liver<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.550> right<00:04:51.000> below<00:04:51.300> this<00:04:51.720> first

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
and the liver is right below this first

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.730 
and the liver is right below this first
decision<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.830> be<00:04:52.979> careful<00:04:53.430> about<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.600> event<00:04:54.990> hi

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
decision so be careful about it event hi

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
so y'all get to that point and then
