00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
on the table design and then you set it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
on the table design and then you set it
down<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.490> table<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.600> touching<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
down on table you will be touching the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
down on table you will be touching the
case<00:01:10.290> however<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:11.520> too<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.850> your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
case however if you're too if your

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
case however if you're too if your
surface<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.689> completely<00:01:13.200> flat<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.799> smooth

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
surface is not completely flat or smooth

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
surface is not completely flat or smooth
you<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.210> laid<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you will not really have laid on the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.270 
you will not really have laid on the
table<00:01:15.689> design<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> very

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
table design so this is a very

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
table design so this is a very
minimalistic<00:01:17.790> case<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
minimalistic case and because of that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
minimalistic case and because of that
it's<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:19.380> very<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.430> thin<00:01:20.729> by<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.119> name<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's also very very thin by the name of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
it's also very very thin by the name of
the<00:01:21.509> title<00:01:21.720> ultra<00:01:22.229> slim<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:23.700> slim

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the title ultra slim this is a very slim

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
the title ultra slim this is a very slim
case<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> also<00:01:24.659> keeps<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> width<00:01:25.409> pretty

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
case and also keeps the width pretty

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
case and also keeps the width pretty
small<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.549> great<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.759> one-handed<00:01:27.299> use

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
small so it's great for one-handed use

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
small so it's great for one-handed use
overall<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:28.829> someone<00:01:29.159> who<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.369> looking

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
overall if you're someone who is looking

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
overall if you're someone who is looking
for<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.909> thin<00:01:30.509> case<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
for a thin case so that's not going to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
for a thin case so that's not going to
