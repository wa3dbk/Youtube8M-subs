00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.089
 is possible that you did not pass 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 all the tests of the seat and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.340
 pastry cooks then ask at 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.650
 of the academy compared to your profile 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.859
 have you ever zapped pastry cook or a bachelor 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.439
 if you have it you just have to go 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.650
 just it's a big word to practice 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 and two other written tests 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.920
 understand what is waiting for you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.309
 day of the pastry cook I'm talking about the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.340
 practice of course sap day and you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.320
 will have to realize four modules one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.360
 entremets with a theme to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 respect for the themes you go them 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.260
 have here january they will be visible 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.640
 on the internet a pie 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.140
 obviously it can be a pie 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 chocolate or lemon meringue pie 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.300
 or other a paste-based realization 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 with cabbage or pasta ruth and knowing that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 the puff pastry so still the most 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.940
 often and of course the pet peeve of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 all the people who pass in candidate 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 free 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.659
 the Bienne laughs so it can be 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.990
 croissants chocolate breads 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.330
 depend grape or brioche 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.340
 milk rolls brioche nanterre and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.369
 that's it's not obvious especially to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.130
 home well to apprehend so this 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.610
 this module is not easy because enchante 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.430
 inch 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 there are still problems but 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.280
 good all this I will explain to you when 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 of an upcoming video the little ones 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 tips for making pastries 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.900
 at Mass to apprehend the practice 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.720
 I already propose to buy 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.299
 the essential the ceap book and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.799
 pastry chefs it's really very good there 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.900
 there are a lot of bass notes not bad 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.500
 explanations about the technology the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 term 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 the material you can also follow me 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.860
 during my classes at michel auguste a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590
 indeed we put in place all the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 weeks on their website a little 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160
 condensed courses that I propose at 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.190
 them 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.240
 third little board training 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.920
 it's not the practice of training 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.270
 times every three weeks to me who 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.550
 is important it's really not that in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.800
 do you have to practice all the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.130
 minimum weeks three hours per 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.119
 week 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.830
 really it's the union minimum 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.450
 are you planning an organization in the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.340
 time measure your work time 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.290
 for info during my classes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.410
 pastry with my students very 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.780
 quickly in three four sessions I 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.840
 does a mini test actually it's a 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.640
 little control so you want and in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.100
 1h30 1h30 or pillin not a minute of 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680
 more they have to realize so a pie 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.380
 with chocolate and a dessert that presides 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 the assembly included and we start with 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.820
 just raw materials for them 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.520
 practice practice stopped with all 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.830
 current trend books prepare 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.570
 your thanks to the data sheets these apps 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 and pastry chefs I will put a link 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.680
 also under this video you go 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.120
 so be able to download the annals in 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.120
 simply does the server and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.590
 pastry chefs from previous years 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.950
 fourth tip put yourself in the place 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.330
 of a future employer for example you 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.100
 go to work 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.799
 what does the employer want from you 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.840
 not a pastry chef know-how 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.680
 roses in sugar a piece mounted everything 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.420
 we'll see later 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.220
 what's really important on the day of 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.350
 That's what the jury looks at you 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.670
 it is you working do you 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.400
 work in respect of hygiene 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.170
 with respect for safety because 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.660
 we have to work in a group so 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.790
 you have to respect your colleagues 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.860
 even though the exam day separately from 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.470
 colleagues obviously this notion of 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.150
 pleasure take pleasure does not do the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.010
 grimace the day of sap and it's not 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.200
 obvious with stress so learn 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.569
 well your bass notes learn well 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.999
 the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.840
 with safety and hygiene and everything is going 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.170
 go well 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.959
 that's it for this little council knew 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.879
 that he would see later that it's not 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.150
 bad at all to have that in the head in 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.730
 made 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.239
 and finally here is my last little 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.790
 advice 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.019
 the pet peeve as soon as we want to train 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.219
 or learn something new 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.209
 it's failure 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:59.730
 for me it is essential to know 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.980
 recognize his failures to succeed 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.560
 it's with chess we'll learn that 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.109
 we will analyze and suddenly we go 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.359
 progress in teeth in this phase 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.980
 learning 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.120
 here it is finished for today I 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.010
 will put in place very quickly 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.720
 other videos on the same theme 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.000
