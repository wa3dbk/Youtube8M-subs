00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
in Salem and god eater 2 as well so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.209 
in Salem and god eater 2 as well so
that's<00:00:57.300> cool<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> other<00:00:58.829> guys

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that's cool so that's the other guys

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.700 
that's cool so that's the other guys
ticketing<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> other<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.870> really

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
ticketing and the other one is really

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
ticketing and the other one is really
difficult<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.399> find<00:01:02.870> all<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.260> early<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
difficult to find all it was early I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
difficult to find all it was early I
couldn't<00:01:05.010> find<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:06.060> Ronin<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.540> because

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
couldn't find it I put Ronin in because

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.969 
couldn't find it I put Ronin in because
I<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.290> probably<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.710> only<00:01:07.799> way

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I think that's probably the only way

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.060 
I think that's probably the only way
you'll<00:01:08.159> find<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.530> maybe<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.830> wasn't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you'll find it if I maybe just wasn't

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
you'll find it if I maybe just wasn't
there<00:01:11.220> earlier<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.210> put<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> lego

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
there earlier but I put in a lego

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830 
there earlier but I put in a lego
ninjago<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.450> actually<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
ninjago and I think there's actually a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469 
ninjago and I think there's actually a
spelling<00:01:16.350> mistake<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.040> believe<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.790> Lego

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
spelling mistake can you believe on Lego

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.550 
spelling mistake can you believe on Lego
