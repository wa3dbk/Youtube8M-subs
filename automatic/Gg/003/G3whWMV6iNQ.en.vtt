looking<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.479> hat<00:01:57.659> rubber<00:01:58.020> ducky<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.380> flag

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
looking for a hat rubber ducky and flag

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.840 
looking for a hat rubber ducky and flag
rubber<00:02:00.600> ducky

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.910 

down<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.939> head<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.200> got<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.380> little<00:02:11.560> combo

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
down the head you got a little combo

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.990 
down the head you got a little combo
meter<00:02:12.099> up<00:02:12.340> here

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
meter up here

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.699 
meter up here
so<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> think<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.959> found<00:02:14.140> all<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.410> items

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.110 
so I think if you found all the items
quickly<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.220> row<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.580> would<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:15.880> more

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
quickly in a row you would get more

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.759 
quickly in a row you would get more
points<00:02:16.330> for<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:19.140> there's<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> flag

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
points for that there's the flag

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.870 
points for that there's the flag
I<00:02:20.800> know<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.130> couldn't<00:02:21.519> see<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:24.730> or

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
I know I couldn't see that right or

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.990 
I know I couldn't see that right or
reward<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.420> waiting<00:02:25.569> for<00:02:25.930> me
