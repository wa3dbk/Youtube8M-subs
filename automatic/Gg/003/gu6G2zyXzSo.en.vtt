00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
daughter's name is Kiera this project is

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.369 
daughter's name is Kiera this project is
called<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.280> Kiera<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.989> first<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.170> went

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
called for Kiera and first I went

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.960 
called for Kiera and first I went
through<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.769> design<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.580> let's<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.879> ahead

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
through some design so let's go ahead

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.250 
through some design so let's go ahead
and<00:00:57.089> check<00:00:57.299> that<00:00:57.479> out<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:57.839> see<00:00:58.019> what<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> came

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and check that out and see what I came

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.460 
and check that out and see what I came
up<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:59.570> started<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> idea<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
up with I started with the idea of the

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.039 
up with I started with the idea of the
letter<00:01:01.650> K<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.309> Kiera<00:01:02.580> I<00:01:02.790> sketched<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> couple

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
letter K for Kiera I sketched a couple

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.020 
letter K for Kiera I sketched a couple
of<00:01:04.140> front<00:01:04.379> views<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.979> pretty<00:01:05.339> quickly<00:01:05.640> came

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
of front views and pretty quickly came

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
of front views and pretty quickly came
up<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.360> something<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.870> liked<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.440> took<00:01:08.370> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
up with something that I liked I took it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
up with something that I liked I took it
to<00:01:08.610> 3d<00:01:08.970> using<00:01:09.270> Sketchup<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.380> front

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to 3d using Sketchup the front

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.100 
to 3d using Sketchup the front
incorporates<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> letter<00:01:11.549> K<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.570> rest<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
incorporates the letter K the rest is a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
incorporates the letter K the rest is a
fairly<00:01:13.530> straightforward<00:01:13.830> chest<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
fairly straightforward chest I got the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
fairly straightforward chest I got the
overall<00:01:15.810> shape<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.260> dimensions<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.010> didn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
overall shape and dimensions but didn't

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
overall shape and dimensions but didn't
add<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> small<00:01:17.970> details<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> sketch

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
add all the small details in the sketch

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
add all the small details in the sketch
up<00:01:19.049> those<00:01:19.770> will<00:01:19.979> come<00:01:20.100> later<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> shop<00:01:22.729> now

wood so try to cut that out a little bit

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.009 
wood so try to cut that out a little bit
as<00:02:25.830> well<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.000> went<00:02:27.180> through<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.629> I'm<00:02:27.870> able

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
as well and I went through and I'm able

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.789 
as well and I went through and I'm able
to<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.409> all<00:02:28.680> my<00:02:29.040> pieces<00:02:29.280> from<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:31.290> single

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
to get all my pieces from this a single

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:38.720 
to get all my pieces from this a single
piece<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.099> walnut

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.150 

except<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.330> front<00:02:40.599> K<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.470> front<00:02:41.770> K<00:02:41.980> is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
except for the front K that front K is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.710 
except for the front K that front K is
going<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.400> from<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> other<00:02:42.849> section<00:02:43.599> of

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
going to be from the other section of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.020 
going to be from the other section of
the<00:02:44.140> other<00:02:44.260> piece<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.590> walnut<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the other piece of walnut I have and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.809 
the other piece of walnut I have and
it's<00:02:46.150> got<00:02:46.300> some<00:02:46.480> curl<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.819> two

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
it's got some curl to it so two

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's got some curl to it so two
different<00:02:49.090> trees<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.989> walnuts<00:02:50.349> going<00:02:50.470> to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
different trees the walnuts going to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.320 
different trees the walnuts going to
look<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:51.069> know<00:02:51.160> slightly<00:02:51.730> different<00:02:52.209> or

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
look you know slightly different or

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.720 
look you know slightly different or
pretty<00:02:52.540> different<00:02:52.959> we'll<00:02:53.050> see<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:54.580> that's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
pretty different we'll see but that's

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.240 
pretty different we'll see but that's
cool<00:02:54.970> because<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:56.380> one<00:02:56.620> will<00:02:56.800> be<00:02:56.920> sort<00:02:57.220> of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
cool because the one will be sort of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.949 
cool because the one will be sort of
curly<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.880> it'll<00:02:58.060> just<00:02:58.180> be<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.450> three<00:02:58.480> pieces

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
curly and it'll just be the three pieces

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.400 
curly and it'll just be the three pieces
of<00:02:59.200> K<00:02:59.440> the<00:03:00.069> leg<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:01.209> then<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.600> course<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.959> you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
of K the leg and then of course the you

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.259 
of K the leg and then of course the you
know<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.010> vertical<00:03:03.489> leg<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> two

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
know this the vertical leg and the two

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.509 
know this the vertical leg and the two
other<00:03:04.450> pieces<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.930> form<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.319> K<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.769> then<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
other pieces to form a K and then the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.400 
other pieces to form a K and then the
rest<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.150> will<00:03:07.269> be<00:03:07.390> out<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.569> this<00:03:07.750> one<00:03:08.080> board

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
rest of it will be out of this one board

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.559 
rest of it will be out of this one board
so<00:03:08.920> it'll<00:03:09.099> really<00:03:09.190> highlight<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.880> K<00:03:10.150> and

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
so it'll really highlight that K and

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.140 
so it'll really highlight that K and
then<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.110> course<00:03:11.140> all<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.680> panel<00:03:12.580> pieces<00:03:12.819> will

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
then of course all the panel pieces will

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.440 
then of course all the panel pieces will
be<00:03:13.180> cherry<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.230> I've<00:03:14.739> got<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> bunch<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.450> cherry

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
be cherry and I've got a bunch of cherry

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.210 
be cherry and I've got a bunch of cherry
over<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.110> rack<00:03:17.290> there<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.890> I'll<00:03:17.980> pull

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
over on the rack there that I'll pull

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.789 
over on the rack there that I'll pull
down<00:03:18.250> what<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.610> need<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.959> from<00:03:20.200> my<00:03:20.350> sketchup

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
down what I need it so from my sketchup

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.100 
down what I need it so from my sketchup
plan<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.610> first<00:03:22.150> want<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.450> start<00:03:22.690> with<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> K<00:03:23.080> I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
plan I first want to start with the K I

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.979 
plan I first want to start with the K I
want<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.410> start<00:03:23.709> with<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.700> front<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.690> so

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
want to start with the front of this so

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
want to start with the front of this so
here's<00:03:26.880> here's<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.000> front

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.640 

front<00:03:36.209> view<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.780> want<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.020> start<00:03:37.380> with<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
front view and I want to start with the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.440 
front view and I want to start with the
whole<00:03:37.860> from<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.400> build<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.880> front<00:03:39.239> first

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
whole from to build that front first

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.520 
whole from to build that front first
most<00:03:39.900> complicated<00:03:40.319> piece<00:03:40.860> it's<00:03:41.550> got<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.910> K

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
most complicated piece it's got this K

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.150 
most complicated piece it's got this K
then<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> rest<00:03:43.830> of<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.130> pretty

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
then the rest of it is pretty

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.250 
then the rest of it is pretty
straightforward<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.239> know<00:03:45.630> frame<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.140> panel

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
straightforward you know frame and panel

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.010 
straightforward you know frame and panel
sides<00:03:46.620> frame<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.190> panel<00:03:47.310> back<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.970> lid<00:03:48.599> so<00:03:48.959> I

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
sides frame and panel back and lid so I

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.790 
sides frame and panel back and lid so I
want<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> fully<00:03:49.680> build<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.700> front<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:52.319> Stiles

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
want to fully build the front the Stiles

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.460 
want to fully build the front the Stiles
rails<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.370> K<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:54.000> then<00:03:54.599> base<00:03:54.930> all<00:03:55.200> my<00:03:55.349> other

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
rails the K and then base all my other

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.890 
rails the K and then base all my other
dimensions<00:03:55.950> off<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.330> took<00:03:57.660> my

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
dimensions off of that so I took my

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.180 
dimensions off of that so I took my
Sketchup<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.500> first<00:03:58.680> want<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:58.890> start<00:03:59.099> with

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
Sketchup and I first want to start with

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.170 
Sketchup and I first want to start with
the<00:03:59.280> curved<00:03:59.610> pieces<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.500> printed<00:04:01.920> out<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.910> K

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
the curved pieces so I printed out the K

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
so you can see a couple of sides side

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.719 
so you can see a couple of sides side
top<00:04:44.349> rails<00:04:44.680> side<00:04:45.099> top<00:04:45.629> as<00:04:46.629> we<00:04:46.780> go<00:04:46.930> along<00:04:47.729> more

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
top rails side top as we go along more

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.559 
top rails side top as we go along more
parts<00:04:49.120> there<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.599> put<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.020> parts<00:04:50.349> in<00:04:50.699> red<00:04:51.699> to

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
parts there I put the parts in red to

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.779 
parts there I put the parts in red to
see<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.080> then<00:04:53.199> just<00:04:53.830> label<00:04:54.280> them<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.580> some

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789

see it and then just label them in some
yellow<00:04:55.000> chalk<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.539> find<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:56.710> chalk<00:04:56.949> lines<00:04:57.250> are

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
yellow chalk I find the chalk lines are

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.820 
yellow chalk I find the chalk lines are
a<00:04:57.550> little<00:04:57.729> bit<00:04:58.030> too<00:04:58.659> wide<00:04:58.900> for<00:04:58.960> my<00:04:59.319> liking<00:04:59.530> so<00:04:59.770> I

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
a little bit too wide for my liking so I

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.159 
a little bit too wide for my liking so I
used<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.069> red<00:05:00.250> pencil<00:05:00.669> for<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:00.849> lines<00:05:01.169> but

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
used the red pencil for the lines but

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.749 
used the red pencil for the lines but
labeled<00:05:02.530> in<00:05:02.620> chalk<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.159> then<00:05:03.370> there's<00:05:03.580> the

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
labeled in chalk and then there's the

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.170 
labeled in chalk and then there's the
other<00:05:03.909> end<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:05.050> you<00:05:05.139> can<00:05:05.289> see<00:05:05.669> one<00:05:06.669> huge

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180

10-foot<00:05:08.139> piece<00:05:08.879> with<00:05:09.879> all<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.389> parts<00:05:10.740> laid

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
10-foot piece with all the parts laid

10-foot piece with all the parts laid
out<00:05:11.919> along<00:05:12.219> it<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:12.430> got<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.639> other<00:05:12.759> piece<00:05:12.969> right

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
out along it I got the other piece right

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.520 
out along it I got the other piece right
next<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.539> and<00:05:14.349> here<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.219> can<00:05:15.460> see<00:05:16.349> that<00:05:17.349> is

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
next to it and here you can see that is

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.000 
next to it and here you can see that is
one<00:05:17.860> long<00:05:18.159> board<00:05:18.699> there
