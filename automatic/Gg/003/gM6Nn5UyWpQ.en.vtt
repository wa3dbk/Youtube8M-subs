00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 with the arrival of spring in the cities of the republic 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 worsened the problem of stray dogs in 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.059
 this time they become especially 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 aggressive and so far the only way 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380
 fight them 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.540
 most inhumans shooting look at this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.660
 the problem was somewhat differently tried by our 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.189
 correspondent natalya pilshchikova this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 the dog lived more than a week on 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.760
 the territory of one of the ben daring 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.320
 enterprises then the workers turned 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 afraid of people pets 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.590
 being on the street almost always lead 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.860
 people themselves want to be prestigious 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.870
 want to be protected they take dogs 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 which seems more or less vicious and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 they will be able to protect their territory either 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 them personally themselves as a result of these dogs 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.789
 find themselves on the street for various reasons 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 whether it can not cope with education 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.899
 these animals waist change life 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.430
 situations in humans whether it was 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.070
 irresponsible attitude 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 animal she lost and no one 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.359
 looking for him no matter kicked out pet or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.070
 just let out to run 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.830
 the dog contributes to the increase 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 homeless animal populations official 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 only one way to fight today 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.670
 shooting for defenders against the authorities not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.110
 see other ways sterilization is worth 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.420
 expensive and the result will give only 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.640
 run and stray dogs attack 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.189
 on the townspeople now one of the ways 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.689
 solving the problem of stray animals 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.240
 increase the responsibility of dog owners 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 the owners are not responsible 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.320
 the hunter takes this animal for 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.900
 homeless spent by state 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.620
 means the owner is killed 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.810
 owner dog 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.670
 the same owner takes a new dog for sure 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.470
 as it comes, we significantly 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.260
 reduce the number of stray animals 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.220
 if the owners will be sterilized in 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.470
 without fail 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.690
 our pets then we really 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.820
 we will see the result turned out to be 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.790
 street dog at best gets into 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.800
 shelter now here about 50 animals per 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.510

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.340
 manages mostly puppies on this 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.800
 shelter constantly need money and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.720
 possible help even this simple booth 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.940
 donated by students is very useful 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.070
 it says Irina settle found 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.990
 Today, he has no pit bull 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.270
 hallmarks former masters nowhere 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.100
 registered a purebred dog with us 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.230
 it is not necessary, but in Russia 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.970
 owners of large dogs will soon be bound 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.340
 carry animal passports 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.910
 the document will indicate the owner and data 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 vaccinations 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.410
 This information may be useful if 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.000
 the dog is not the first to bite 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.220
 year speak of a mandatory 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 passportisation and sticking laziness and home 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.170
 animals are in the opinion of the defenders 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.910
 sort of an alternative to shooting if 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.040
 the owner would face a fine for what he 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.170
 released the animal on the street homeless 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.150
 dogs would be less but the passport is not 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.670
 protect the dog from shelling if she 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.680
 walking alone is much safer 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.230
 personally look after a pet not 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.300
