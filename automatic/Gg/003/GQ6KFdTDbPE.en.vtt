different<00:00:18.750> parts<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.529> fire<00:00:19.770> alarm<00:00:19.890> system

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.220 

this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.750> main<00:00:26.000> panel<00:00:27.000> user<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this is your main panel user this is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.630 
this is your main panel user this is
your<00:00:28.410> CPU

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
your CPU

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.609 
your CPU
devices<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.970> power<00:00:31.240> power<00:00:31.840> supplies<00:00:32.290> and

devices and power power supplies and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.860 
devices and power power supplies and
amplifiers<00:00:33.160> you<00:00:33.820> know<00:00:34.000> this<00:00:34.240> is<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.660> cool

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
amplifiers you know this is the cool

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.220 
amplifiers you know this is the cool
station<00:00:35.350> yeah<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.880> is<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.120> strobe<00:00:37.450> yep

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
station yeah this is the strobe yep

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.350 
station yeah this is the strobe yep
these<00:00:38.500> are<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.890> smoke<00:00:39.160> detectors<00:00:39.760> here<00:00:40.000> yes

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
these are the smoke detectors here yes

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.220 
these are the smoke detectors here yes
the<00:00:40.660> smoke

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
the smoke

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.130 
the smoke
this<00:00:41.530> one<00:00:41.770> is<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.920> heat<00:00:42.190> detector<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.940> got<00:00:43.810> the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
this one is a heat detector I got the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.190 
this one is a heat detector I got the
part<00:00:44.440> numbers<00:00:44.860> listed<00:00:45.100> on<00:00:45.510> each<00:00:46.510> one<00:00:46.960> of<00:00:47.110> these

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
part numbers listed on each one of these

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.549 
part numbers listed on each one of these
so<00:00:47.920> I'll<00:00:48.100> know<00:00:48.340> exactly<00:00:48.820> which<00:00:49.480> part<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:50.380> know

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
so I'll know exactly which part you know

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.990 
so I'll know exactly which part you know
goes<00:00:50.770> where<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:52.480> panel<00:00:52.989> it<00:00:53.500> has<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:54.460> has<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
goes where this panel it has it has the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.119 
goes where this panel it has it has the
opportunity<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:56.050> have<00:00:56.230> two<00:00:56.559> loops<00:00:56.830> which

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
opportunity to have two loops which

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.479 
opportunity to have two loops which
means<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:58.090> can<00:00:58.270> have<00:00:58.450> double<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.800> devices

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
means you can have double the devices

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.180 
means you can have double the devices
that<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.790> got<00:01:01.000> connected<00:01:01.330> to<00:01:01.660> here<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:03.010> helps

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
that you got connected to here it helps

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
devices are missing it's going to take a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.750 
devices are missing it's going to take a
few<00:02:30.160> minutes<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.750> shows<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.380> at<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.490> point

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
few minutes it shows up at this point

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.810 
few minutes it shows up at this point
here<00:02:34.270> leave<00:02:34.990> one<00:02:35.320> device<00:02:36.190> -<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:39.340> are<00:02:39.610> all

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
here leave one device - these are all

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.290 
here leave one device - these are all
addressable<00:02:40.600> panels<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.340> lot<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
addressable panels because a lot of the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.780 
addressable panels because a lot of the
old<00:02:43.870> conventional<00:02:44.460> they<00:02:45.460> weren't

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
old conventional they weren't

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.330 
old conventional they weren't
addressable<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:47.530> couldn't<00:02:47.800> really<00:02:48.010> tell

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
addressable so you couldn't really tell

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.320 
addressable so you couldn't really tell
exactly<00:02:48.610> where<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.330> was<00:02:49.560> say<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.740> got<00:02:51.330> 13

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
exactly where it was say if you got 13

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.260 
exactly where it was say if you got 13

addressable you know exactly what

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.160 
addressable you know exactly what
location<00:03:02.710> that<00:03:03.430> they're<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.450> addressable

is like the newer kind yeah a lot of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.290 
is like the newer kind yeah a lot of
stuff<00:03:08.620> now<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:09.160> address<00:03:09.670> because<00:03:09.910> there's<00:03:10.240> a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
stuff now is address because there's a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.250 
stuff now is address because there's a
lot<00:03:10.480> more<00:03:10.630> thing<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.550> how<00:03:12.760> many<00:03:12.820> on<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.990> this

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
lot more thing so how many on can this

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.140 
lot more thing so how many on can this
panel<00:03:14.770> hold<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:16.600> panel<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:18.190> each

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
panel hold this panel can have up each

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.690 
panel hold this panel can have up each
loop<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.990> think<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> hundred<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.160> ninety<00:03:21.490> six

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
loop I think is a hundred and ninety six

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.220 
loop I think is a hundred and ninety six
device<00:03:22.120> 198<00:03:23.110> devices<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.890> times<00:03:24.310> there<00:03:24.580> times

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
device 198 devices so times there times

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.190 
device 198 devices so times there times
ten

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
