00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 third division darmstadt has so far all 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.350
 brought home points and was today as 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.099
 of course, this clearly in the host 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.440
 advantage 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.690
 not an easy game for hansa then 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.730
 Rostock sat in this season 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 away looked always gloomy is not 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.650
 grown on a strange lawn 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.640
 but that has changed today 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.859
 but unfortunately not some fans again 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.699
 once negatively noticed 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.019
 Once again bengalos in the hansa block 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.940
 rostock threatens thus already like in the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.690
 Last season a drastic 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.300
 fine 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.899
 some chaotic seem easy 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 to be unteachable, of course, very much 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.760
 Unfortunately, especially since they know 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.980
 that we branded 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 That's what they should do best 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.590
 that does not belong in the game 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.480
 first a negative climax 22 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.609
 minute mess in the rostocker 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.609
 defensive carpenter to Qatar on 01 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.600
 wolfgang wolf serves the best chance 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.860
 rostocker comes in the first half 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.480
 from the coach son but patrick wolfs 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.900
 header just goes to the latte 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.930
 the game to break due to the weather 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.120
 quite bleak even worse 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.740
 at the beginning of the second half again 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.740
 fire in the hansa block 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.080
 but then it will be better the game and 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.080
 especially Hansa Rostock 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.780
 there is still the compensation of the man from the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.070
 own offspring achieved the 1 1 in the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.320
 67 minutes 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 the end result we wanted to win here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.400
 the clear at darmstadt to all four 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 got points at home that is also clear 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.660
 and as I said, we still have to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 find and I put in the last 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.720
 two three weeks that it always 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.730
 better the teugner playful too 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.120
 already much better and now it is after 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.590
 burg heap and win there 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.400
 Rostock plays one already on Wednesday 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.619
 burghausen 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.950
 the next possibility finally the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.050
 to celebrate first win of the season 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.750
 they have some of their team 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.750
 once more harmed than used
