00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
now I'm going to start pinning make sure

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.720 
now I'm going to start pinning make sure
that<00:02:57.090> your<00:02:57.300> safety<00:02:57.780> pinning<00:02:58.080> along<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that your safety pinning along the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.170 
that your safety pinning along the
outside<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.130> hanger<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.670> make<00:03:03.000> sure

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
outside of the hanger and make sure

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.880 
outside of the hanger and make sure
you're<00:03:03.360> getting<00:03:03.660> both<00:03:04.050> pieces<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.709> fabric

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
you're getting both pieces of fabric

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.500 
you're getting both pieces of fabric
because<00:03:05.190> remember<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.730> folded<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> fabric

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
because remember you folded the fabric

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.960 
because remember you folded the fabric
in<00:03:06.870> half<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:07.830> need<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.280> make<00:03:08.430> sure<00:03:08.459> you're

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
in half so you need to make sure you're

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.300 
in half so you need to make sure you're
securing<00:03:09.630> both<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.320> those<00:03:10.410> fabric<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.070> between

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.380 
securing both of those fabric in between
this<00:03:12.180> safety<00:03:12.690> pin<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:14.250> balanced<00:03:15.060> so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
this safety pin so that it's balanced so

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.240 
this safety pin so that it's balanced so
you<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.660> see<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> outside

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
you can see all this is on the outside

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.790 
you can see all this is on the outside

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.920 
and then I safety pin all under here on
that<00:03:20.070> outside<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.840> nice<00:03:22.080> little<00:03:22.350> line<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
that outside just a nice little line and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.020

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
character that the safety pins give it

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.260
