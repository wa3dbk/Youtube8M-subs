juvenile at the aquarium that I raised

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.760 
juvenile at the aquarium that I raised
up<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:43.090> always<00:02:43.510> looked<00:02:43.840> female<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.380> for

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
up and it always looked female like for

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.310 
up and it always looked female like for
a<00:02:45.010> year<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.790> looked<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> female<00:02:46.540> animal

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.900 
a year it looked like a female animal
and<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.460> developed<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
and then all this and I developed a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.080 
and then all this and I developed a
pouch<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.810> profile<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.920> looks<00:02:51.090> female

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
pouch and so in profile it looks female

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.060 
pouch and so in profile it looks female
but<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:52.870> if<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.110> turn<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> around<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.950> see

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
but then if you turn it around and see

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.440 
but then if you turn it around and see
it<00:02:54.160> from<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> front<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.790> definitely<00:02:55.330> see
