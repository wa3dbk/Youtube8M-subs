 I'm here with this video to sanction 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.260
 the beginning of a competition for competitions e 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.330
 contests are very popular, for example 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.460
 when you are giving away what i di 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 video games from my crooked and i 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 video games what fantastic but 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 today is much better because there is not 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 they will be only video games but thanks to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 suffers Italy there will also be gods 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.779
 car components and therefore things in the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.090
 course of this video inspired you which 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 are the rewards how to participate that lives 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.270
 in short, there was all things 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.920
 the ordinary administration all 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 useful things we start from the prizes 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 certainly very important then 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 first the prizes will be placed in 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 prize based on the number of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.059
 I will explain to you now 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.239
 first of all regardless of whether they are there 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.550
 0 2005 thousand participants up for grabs 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.980
 or rather there will always be two winners 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.750
 these two people can win one 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.239
 copy to choose from the following 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.660
 video games that are sleeping dogs deus 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.399
 ex far cry 3 blog dragon or del 3 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 so regardless as mentioned by 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.489
 number of participants will always be there 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.530
 two winners who can choose one 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.970
 game has chosen from those listed in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.860
 moments in which the thousand were reached 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.869
 there will be two more participants 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.330
 winners are two winners who will have a chance 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 to choose two games to repeat choices 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 two games to choose from among those before 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.680
 I told you then sleeping dogs for three 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.570
 far cry 3 blue drag queen deus ex and in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 plus they will also be able to choose between tf 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.110
 eichmann therefore to a thousand participants 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 we will have other winners 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 so for a total of 4 winners 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.229
 serapide to its thousand participants a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.450
 2,000 participants will be there instead 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.479
 two other winners two other people 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 which way to win 3 is repeated 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.360
 video games chosen from video games 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.790
 which before listed more without occupied 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 so if we attained in 2000 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.270
 Participants will have of you six 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.909
 winners who can choose between 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.530
 video game of their choice 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.840
 but the most interesting part comes 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.009
 three thousand subscribers when there 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.270
 were let us say three thousand members a 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.759
 this competition however we say 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.710
 participants will not be alone anymore 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.539
 videogames but also ardor in 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.729
 particular way to know Italy puts in 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.459
 prize two motherboards equipped with 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.330
 processors that as you can see here 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.220
 in the image that will be up for grabs 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.930
 these two motherboards also based 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.150
 precisely of processors not only the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.129
 motherboard that you can two of you 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.110
 in short, they will be able to take home here 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.049
 two hardware that you could 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.579
 allow perhaps to assemble them a pc 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.390
 without having to go and then to buy you 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.910
 these components 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.099
 then I know if you don't care, it suffocates stuff 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.120
 so much is free stuff unless paid 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.890
 so I also think of you 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.049
 so he explained the brief but now 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.730
 how to participate how to participate is 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.299
 simple because the end is always the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.610
 usual things 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.170
 do this this and that and hope 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.090
 in a huge asshole 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.129
 this is the concept now anyway 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.989
 I explain first step you have to become a fan 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.440
 of safire italia of their page 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.819
 Facebook 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.739
 below in the description you will find the link 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.420
 to go directly to their page 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.340
 facebook and become a fan then the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.500
 moment in which rock notes and there will be 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.630
 thousand new fans 2009 fanta and milan i 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.180
 fan is gradually going to add i 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.769
 awards as I indicated before 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.720
 so the first step is very simple 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.920
 click on a link and limit it ago 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.139
 easy 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.269
 I hope so second step you have to go 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.380
 on my facebook page and you will find a 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.720
 topic 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.480
 a post dedicated to the competition where you have to 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.769
 go for two simple things to put 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200
 lay put like it 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.459
 then share that place in short 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.919
 you have to do these two simple actions 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.290
 for that place the post you will recognize 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.060
 immediately because it will be at the top of the page 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.230
 facebook and in any case will be the dedicated one 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.720
 the perfect third and perfect competition 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.790
 last fundamental steppe here below 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.919
 in the description as in the post of 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.660
 facebook you will find a link there 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.919
 will send a google document where 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.130
 you will have to go and fill it out with the 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.630
 your surname name also your link 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.280
 of your facebook page because the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.569
 link to the personal facebook page 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.489
 because that way I can 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.379
 check that you actually are 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.319
 safari fans cut as you have 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.879
 shared rather than put like all 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.700
 so I recommend you do them all 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.659
 these actions however find one 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.069
 google document you need to go 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.689
 quietly fill in with all the 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.670
 necessary information that me 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.319
 will serve to effect the situation 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.620
 it's a hopeful second time too 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.530
 send you the prize you are hoping for 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.000
 have seen with the great blow of care 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.739
 so here they are the three steps 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.160
 fundamentals very simple to become 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.620
 fan 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.509
 put lay share and compile 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.070
 the google document would also be a 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.930
 fourth point a bad point that is not 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.699
 necessary to participate in the contest 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.220
 let's say one more thing one more thing 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.900
 which for my part would be very welcome 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.720
 that is, to leave a simple lay this 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.310
 videos do not tell you it is necessary 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.410
 because I have no way of verifying that 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.810
 you do it or not and therefore you don't 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.000
 force you to do it I just tell you that 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.860
 if he had appreciated this initiative e 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.960
 you were in sovereignty and your good 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.060
 heart that it is appropriate to leave me a 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.070
 like for this video but in short for 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.289
 be here to bring you a new contest 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.820
 which I particularly care about myself 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.190
 often like to come here with some 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.259
 contest for the brave give you in the way of 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.759
 win something then if so 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.070
 does not consider it appropriate 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.210
 leave a like otherwise 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.259
 no one offends me anyway 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.659
 thank you for being here in this 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.539

 how to participate in the duration of the contest 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.909

 participants and above all also a 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.059
 greater number of participants 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:42.729
 means more and more 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:44.529
 succulent of prizes therefore I would say that 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.569

 Hi guys
