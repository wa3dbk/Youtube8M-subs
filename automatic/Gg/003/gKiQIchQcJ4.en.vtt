00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
ball all that power you created in your

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.660 
ball all that power you created in your
backswing<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.799> into<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.280> ground

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
backswing is going into the ground

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.330 
backswing is going into the ground
you<00:02:34.060> don't<00:02:34.239> one<00:02:34.420> thing<00:02:34.660> with<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> low<00:02:35.680> backswing

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
you don't one thing with a low backswing

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.030 
you don't one thing with a low backswing
now<00:02:37.060> all<00:02:37.299> your<00:02:37.510> power<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.959> moving<00:02:38.290> forward<00:02:38.829> in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
now all your power is moving forward in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.990 
now all your power is moving forward in
the<00:02:39.250> direction<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:40.180> want<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.450> ball<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.660> go<00:02:42.000> if

the direction you want the ball to go if

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.940 
the direction you want the ball to go if
you<00:02:43.329> follow<00:02:43.630> through<00:02:43.900> high<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.530> your<00:02:44.620> swing

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
you follow through high on your swing

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.280 
you follow through high on your swing
this<00:02:45.280> will<00:02:45.459> cause<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.700> ball<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.060> not<00:02:46.450> go<00:02:46.690> up<00:02:46.989> as

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
this will cause the ball to not go up as

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.039 
this will cause the ball to not go up as
high<00:02:47.799> as<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:48.040> should<00:02:48.100> when<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:48.940> kick<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.810> want
