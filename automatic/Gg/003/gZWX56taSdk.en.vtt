 palm trees and is that they are very attractive and serves to decorate but many come from 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.660
 different parts of the world some are endemic to the central area of ​​the state 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.820

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.120

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 palms palm trees attend 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.530
 friends or in the long run I tell myself how Mr. José Hernández is an expert 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.400
 in plants knows a little about precisely the palm trees and the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.020
 palmas moscow fears for it to be present about the names that are 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.449
 rare others are more everyday but let's get to know them take away from this 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.690
 protected space its little about 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 palm tree expressly with palms found in this garden 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.420
 third level pull out so down displays we have to the b 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.360
 after her little presumptuous 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.580
 classic 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.730
 arecas 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.140
 and this 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.440
 or so it seemed that it would be the most commercial that is handled that in the park 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.660
 public 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.640
 so 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.110
 only then can we get all 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.240
 apart from that for example they are handled 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.810
