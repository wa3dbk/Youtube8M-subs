00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.054
Flying today's performance is Chief Warrant Officer Dan Edwards and watching this 60 degree roll

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:30.696
Also demonstrating the apache's maneuverability for all air-to-air confrontations.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.400
as he makes his s turns and large bank permitting ground fire and heat seeking missiles

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400
to follow him

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
now as he gets to the end of his area, he will pause for just a few seconds

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740
and then he is going to demonstrate a beautiful turn showing the controllability

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.740
of this aircraft

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
this is a power and coordination maneuver, and at the end of the runway the helicopter

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.140
will return in the opposite direction. completing turns in the opposite direction

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740
now the helicopter was once described as being a nightmare to handle. it's kind of like patting your stomach and rubbing your head at the same time

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:32.396
well, this new technology has made it much easier to control

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.460
now, a lot of things are electronically controlled.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
well, you say what happens if that electronic control goes away?

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:49.473
the pilot simply goes back learning to fly the helicopter like he did in training
