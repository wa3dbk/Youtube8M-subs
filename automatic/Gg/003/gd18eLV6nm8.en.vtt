just click on this lip and hit p on our
keyboard<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:30.220> can<00:00:30.369> move<00:00:30.490> our<00:00:30.579> lip<00:00:30.790> locators

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
keyboard we can move our lip locators

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.540 
keyboard we can move our lip locators
around<00:00:31.480> that<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:33.040> i'll<00:00:33.160> just<00:00:33.340> go<00:00:33.460> in

around that and then i'll just go in

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.000 
around that and then i'll just go in
here<00:00:33.880> and<00:00:34.030> i'll<00:00:34.600> start<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:35.020> move<00:00:35.860> these

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
here and i'll start to move these

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.729 
here and i'll start to move these
samples<00:00:36.460> around<00:00:36.790> so<00:00:37.030> it's<00:00:37.870> going<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.170> expand

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
samples around so it's going to expand

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
samples around so it's going to expand
this<00:00:38.920> so<00:00:39.040> we<00:00:39.100> can<00:00:39.160> see<00:00:39.430> what<00:00:39.640> notes<00:00:40.120> we've<00:00:40.329> got

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090 

so<00:00:44.260> this<00:00:44.410> is<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.559> second<00:00:45.370> bar<00:00:46.090> and<00:00:46.480> our<00:00:46.510> lip<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
so this is a second bar and our lip so

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.229 
so this is a second bar and our lip so
I'm<00:00:48.129> just<00:00:48.250> going<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.430> move<00:00:48.609> this<00:00:48.820> right<00:00:49.059> so<00:00:49.180> I'm

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
I'm just going to move this right so I'm

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:57.049 
I'm just going to move this right so I'm
going<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.420> get<00:00:49.690> rid<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:49.960> kick<00:00:50.199> drum<00:00:50.410> here

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
off the the triplet here so back there

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:09.430 
off the the triplet here so back there
are<00:02:51.709> 32<00:02:56.590> I'll<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.830> move<00:02:58.040> these<00:02:58.250> off<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:09.260> rest

are 32 I'll just move these off the rest

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
are 32 I'll just move these off the rest
of<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.620> we<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:09.800> keep<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.040> sin<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.820> let's

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
of that we can keep the sin so let's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:25.300 
of that we can keep the sin so let's
have<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.090> lesson<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.390> duck

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.160 

and<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:26.610> if<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.090> took<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.540> again<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
and then if we just took it again the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.040 
and then if we just took it again the
first<00:03:28.830> look<00:03:29.130> hold<00:03:30.030> down<00:03:30.180> alt<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.630> drag<00:03:30.810> out

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
first look hold down alt and drag out

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.660 
first look hold down alt and drag out
over<00:03:31.290> at<00:03:31.680> p<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.550> do<00:03:35.640> our<00:03:35.670> final<00:03:36.060> lip<00:03:36.450> here

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.040 

let's<00:03:41.670> get<00:03:41.790> rid<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.060> extra<00:03:42.570> hit<00:03:42.750> and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
let's get rid of that extra hit and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.750 
let's get rid of that extra hit and
we'll<00:03:43.230> get<00:03:43.320> rid<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.530> kick<00:03:43.770> drum<00:03:43.950> again<00:03:44.100> an

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
we'll get rid of that kick drum again an

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.530 
we'll get rid of that kick drum again an
ankle<00:03:45.750> go<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.170> our<00:03:46.520> triplets<00:03:47.520> again<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.120> 16th

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
ankle go to our triplets again the 16th

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.390 
ankle go to our triplets again the 16th
of<00:03:48.630> triplet<00:03:51.290> just<00:03:52.290> move<00:03:52.560> these<00:03:52.710> onto<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
of triplet just move these onto the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.330 
of triplet just move these onto the
triplet<00:03:57.320> in<00:03:58.320> fact<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.770> think<00:03:58.860> I'll<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.070> bring

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
triplet in fact I think I'll just bring

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.480 
triplet in fact I think I'll just bring
across<00:03:59.610> our<00:04:00.170> second<00:04:01.170> drum<00:04:01.380> loop<00:04:01.590> which<00:04:02.310> has

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
across our second drum loop which has

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.830 
across our second drum loop which has
pretty<00:04:02.820> much<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.090> same<00:04:03.270> thing<00:04:03.330> we're<00:04:03.660> going

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
pretty much the same thing we're going

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.920 
pretty much the same thing we're going
for<00:04:07.760> we'll<00:04:08.760> just<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:09.000> rid<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.210> it<00:04:09.360> final<00:04:09.750> two

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
for we'll just get rid of it final two

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:20.300 
for we'll just get rid of it final two
hots<00:04:10.410> at<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.740> end<00:04:10.920> there<00:04:18.920> okay<00:04:19.920> so<00:04:19.980> that's<00:04:20.220> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
hots at the end there okay so that's a

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.920 
hots at the end there okay so that's a
four<00:04:20.520> bar<00:04:20.670> lip<00:04:20.910> draw<00:04:21.120> night<00:04:21.330> I'm<00:04:21.690> just<00:04:21.780> going

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
four bar lip draw night I'm just going

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.840 
four bar lip draw night I'm just going
to<00:04:21.989> go<00:04:22.080> into<00:04:22.200> this<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:23.220> last<00:04:23.460> bar<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.790> the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
to go into this this last bar of the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.180 
to go into this this last bar of the
loop<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.840> change<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.560> very<00:04:25.740> last

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
loop and just change the the very last

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.220 
loop and just change the the very last
head<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:27.000> at<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> minute<00:04:28.110> we're

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
head on it so at the minute we're

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.720 
head on it so at the minute we're
learning<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:28.950> sort<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.160> factory<00:04:29.550> noise

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
learning on that sort of factory noise

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.000 
learning on that sort of factory noise
again<00:04:30.110> just<00:04:31.110> going<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.290> move<00:04:31.410> this<00:04:31.560> up<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.890> the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
again just going to move this up to the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.250 
again just going to move this up to the
Tom<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:37.610> we'll<00:04:38.610> also<00:04:38.760> put<00:04:39.480> in<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.780> vocal

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
Tom and we'll also put in the vocal

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:55.070 
Tom and we'll also put in the vocal
noise<00:04:40.410> as<00:04:40.620> well

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:11.850 

so<00:04:56.080> we<00:04:56.200> just<00:04:56.350> hear<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.560> hold<00:04:56.920> it<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:11.620> going

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860

white noise bring it back an hour tom
will<00:06:19.810> bring<00:06:19.960> this<00:06:20.110> back

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:30.890 

okay<00:06:29.159> so<00:06:29.219> that's<00:06:29.610> our<00:06:29.819> entire<00:06:30.389> for<00:06:30.689> barley

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
okay so that's our entire for barley

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.450 
okay so that's our entire for barley
programmed<00:06:31.469> we're<00:06:31.830> going<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.009> do<00:06:32.099> a<00:06:32.129> variation

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
programmed we're going to do a variation

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.369 
programmed we're going to do a variation
on<00:06:32.699> this<00:06:32.819> later<00:06:33.059> on<00:06:33.270> and<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:34.080> next<00:06:34.289> tutorial

on this later on and the next tutorial
we're<00:06:34.740> going<00:06:34.770> to<00:06:34.919> go<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:35.729> individual

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
we're going to go to the individual

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.999 
we're going to go to the individual
groups<00:06:36.449> on<00:06:36.629> this<00:06:36.779> and<00:06:37.050> apply<00:06:37.469> a<00:06:37.499> little<00:06:37.800> bit<00:06:37.919> of

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
groups on this and apply a little bit of

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.580 
groups on this and apply a little bit of
EQ<00:06:38.219> and<00:06:38.520> compression
