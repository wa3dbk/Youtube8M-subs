00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.850
 Forza Motorsport is the jewel in the crown 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.860
 from the first days of xbox one there is no 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.689
 doubts about it the video game console of 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.640
 Microsoft has tried to offer a great 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.800
 variety of proposals in its catalog 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.500
 launch and within the speed of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.570
 the best option was clear in 2013 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.760
 the fifth installment of the tandem saga 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.150
 it takes hold in the playable and offers us a 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 shocking graphic section 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.140
 little by little we have been seeing how the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.670
 strength have been taking a very strong direction 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.280
 clear as to his way of understanding 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 the speed this time and already with a 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.730
 next - generation hardware which 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.830
 have done is not opt ​​for big 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.120
 changes and take advantage of what they have 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.430
 between hands with its possibilities 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.380
 technological and also with its new 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.880
 I command as they have done with a 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.070
 innovative way of understanding the 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.080
 vibration of the triggers now the car 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.390
 communicates with us through the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.310
 path and it does it by offering us resistance 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
 with the acceleration and the brake in some 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.479
 circumstances but also marking us 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.670
 clearly when we are taking it to 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.060
 limit or even when we're going to lose 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 the control 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.650
 as is obvious this is not going to revolutionize 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 the genre of speed but if it gives 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.729
 a new way of understanding it in terms 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.649
 to its handling without a flyer if we are of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.840
 those that slow down and accelerate to the maximum in 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.640
 each maneuver we will not notice and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.070
 we are going to lose a good part of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.690
 what this forza motorsport 5 offers 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 but if we are the ones we like 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.560
 listen to our car and have a 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
 most realistic and intuitive experience is 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.630
 a much more important development than 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.939
 what seems 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.740
 otherwise the video game is still very 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.289
 clearly the line of the saga up 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 now this is truthful driving and something 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.600
 heavy and a tendency to oversteer 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.490
 in the curves that yes the power of xbox 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.679
 one allows the video game to do lots 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.450
 of calculations that I could not before and that 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.490
 translate in more realism and in a 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.789
 behavior of cars more unique and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.069
 truthful 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.439
 this also contributes the try to tar 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.359
 and is that after this sophisticated name is 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.430
 hides one of the biggest news of the 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.170
 program the videogame collects our 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.299
 way of driving and our attitude to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.459
 flyer and projects it in the games of 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.620
 other users around the world in shape 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.659
 of what their rival pilots will be 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.459
 What this means is that both 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.349
 games of others like ours 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.790
 they fill up with adversary cars that are a 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.859
 mix between artificial intelligence 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.959
 and the behaviors of others 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.670
 amateurs all achievement when it comes to 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.620
 provide surprise components to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.150
 careers although on some occasions its 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.489
 behavior is excessively aggressive 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 in terms of modalities everything follows a 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.209
 very similar line alone 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.860
 main strong dish is in the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.870
 different series with different 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.180
 vehicles is the best way to start 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.980
 besides very addictive everything 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.900
 we do not report points to improve 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.150
 our machines or buy new ones 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.709
 and now we find the peculiarity of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.810
 each racing car with which we do 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.489
 will have his own career by 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.170
 course with a complete series of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.269
 tests presented as usual 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.150
 impeccable form by a careful voice in 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.010
 off we return to the clear hot asphalt 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.629
 that if we talk about this type of detail 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.150
 the king is again the presence 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.859
 guest of the top gear team here not 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.480
 only the passion of the team is demonstrated 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.280
 of development for everything that has to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 see with the speed but also 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.790
 we will learn many curiosities and 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.159
 stories about any of the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.819
 vehicles that make up forza motorsport 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:38.819
 5 are a food and athlete and why 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.709
 they expel gruen prats is however going to 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.109
 be in the multiplayer where more time 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.819
 let's go one more time is the best 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.769
 option and the most addictive with its 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.109
 Competitive component for up to 16 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.760
 simultaneous runners but also 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.020
 has lots of options for 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.730
 social character for 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.680
 a release in which the differences 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.800
 between the offline game and the online game are 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.260
 increasingly diffuse 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.060
 from the visual point of view it 's easy 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.940
 be surprised by the appearance of 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.850
 forza motorsport 5 your resolution of 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.770
 1080p and its 60 frames per second are 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.660
 a guarantee of aesthetic fidelity and 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.370
 also fluent and impressive 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.140
 modeling the vehicles carries the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.540
 gender of driving to a new level 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.000
 details like the lighting are very 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.770
 achieved and nuances here and there as the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.750
 reflexes help especially to 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.560
 immerse ourselves and feel ourselves inside 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.690
 example the cockpit 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.430
 as for the sound little to say that 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.960
 go to surprise since the series 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.000
 has always been characterized by its 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.040
 incredible level the soundtrack is 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.750
 extraordinary and except the voices of 'top 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.240
 gear 'that are in the original version on 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.470
 rest are in perfect Castilian 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.630
 Special mention as always to the 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.610
 powerful roars of the engines so 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.610
 care and distinctive as always 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.090
 Forza Motorsport 5 is a start from 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.220
 generation of great level for 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.260
 Saga of speed does not offer changes 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.940
 playable drastic but if there are many 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.470
 adjustments and developments for 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.050
 make us feel closer to a 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.820
 Real piloting experience lots of 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.950
 hours of entertainment and a section 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.020
 visual impact are the keys to the 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.970
 which is for now the best proposal of 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.970
 driving the new machine cycle
