00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.000
 five years and a new console we have heard that it will be the park May return 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
 to delight us with a platform in three dimensions 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 Super Mario Galaxy 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.929
 supposes the culmination of a style of fire initiated in May 64 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 trying to convey the essence of the era of messi super nintendo 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.400
 to environments where freedom of movement is much greater 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.110
 in super mario galaxy 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 the use of the three dimensions is carried out in a way 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.340
 going beyond what no fire vice has done before in this 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.310
 appearance 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.290
 the levels are over 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.510
 we are now on small planets 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.510
 circling around them 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 when you reach the edge of a surface 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 we appear on the other side 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.140
 we can jump from star aspen and from those barriers to his troops 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 the surface spiritually walk intimacy 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.980
 has been recreated so that the adaptation is done almost 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.620
 immediate 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 you are constantly playing with gravity 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.960
 it is not what we see in the bottom of the screen 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 but we fall here to body suspended in space 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.750
 there are numerous challenges where the direction of gravity change continuously and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 we have to be able to predict them move quickly 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.930
 all this could not be achieved without a camera that even the action without 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.440
 miss any detail 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.140
 the movement of it is completely automatic 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.130
 although if we want it sometimes we can go to class to put it behind our 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 or perhaps the first person view to observe the state 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.499
 the positioning of the camera will not be just an aid 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.040
 but sometimes it will be placed in a way that poses special challenges 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.060
 for example standing sideways remembering old times 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.060
 It happened in Spain 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.129
 efe 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 4 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.099
 in this new delivery the design of the levels is much more linear as 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.980
 once the primates were the saints before the exploration there were other objectives 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
 secondary 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.449
 rock 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.449
 A) Yes 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.719
 in the age of high definition 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.229
 visually demonstrates that wii despite its known limitations can still 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.930
 fascinate if you take maximum care of the design and look for perspectives 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.029
 shocking 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.029
 everything moves with much 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.929
 the soundtrack is masterly 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:21.669
 and Coty com do has achieved a job that elevates even more to the category of work 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.499
 teacher this video game 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.859
 although most compositions are new 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.470
 tributes to ancient melodies of the sac will not be lacking 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.750
 the use of control has been done in a very intelligent way 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.659
 using its full virtues 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.120
 It rang at very specific levels so that, in general, the use of the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.279
 motion sensor 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.829
 in bizarre ways that spoiled the former game system manager 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.959
 if anything has characterized May since his first platform video game 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.049
 it has been his ability to transform 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.019
 and in super mario galaxy it was not going to be less 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.209
 stand out among all the costumes that of mario bees the feeling that produces 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.530
 see him for the first time and interact with him 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.119
 it is only surpassed by the image of its brother and that turned into accounts 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.119
 Super Mario Galaxy is a totally timeless creation 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.379
 the details have been taken care of to the maximum 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.379
 and there are important developments in the field of gameplay 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.320
 peace 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.999
 act 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.270
 maybe at the beginning something simple for regular players 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 but collect the 120 stars it is not so easy 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.819
 Enjoy this gem in your life because platforms are no longer made
