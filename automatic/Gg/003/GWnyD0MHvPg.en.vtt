00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.039 

first<00:01:56.759> off<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> want<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> give<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> rules<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
first off I want to give the rules for

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569 
first off I want to give the rules for
this<00:01:58.140> series<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.250> our<00:01:59.340> rules

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this series there's not all our rules

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.459 
this series there's not all our rules
but<00:01:59.939> there's<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.630> guidelines<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but there's like some guidelines that I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
but there's like some guidelines that I
just<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> stick<00:02:02.579> around<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
just like to kind of stick around to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
just like to kind of stick around to
make<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> fair<00:02:03.630> series<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.740> main<00:02:04.890> idea<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
make it a fair series the main idea I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.440 
make it a fair series the main idea I
want<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> stay<00:02:05.520> behind<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.149> I'd<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
want to stay behind is that I'd like to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.139 
want to stay behind is that I'd like to
keep<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.350> repeatable<00:02:08.039> series<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.060> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
keep this a repeatable series so if I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.699 
keep this a repeatable series so if I
were<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> try<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.509> again<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.379> anyone<00:02:10.619> else

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
were to try this again or if anyone else

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.720 
were to try this again or if anyone else
is<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> try<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.580> I'm<00:02:11.700> doing

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
is going to try to do what I'm doing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.920 
is going to try to do what I'm doing
they'd<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.660> able<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> copy<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.319> exact

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
they'd be able to copy it exact

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
they'd be able to copy it exact
so<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.800> means<00:02:14.980> I'm<00:02:15.160> not<00:02:15.250> gonna<00:02:15.400> take<00:02:15.489> any

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
so that means I'm not gonna take any

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.150 
so that means I'm not gonna take any
handouts<00:02:16.030> from<00:02:16.540> any<00:02:16.780> other<00:02:16.989> players<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.920> just

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
handouts from any other players so just

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
handouts from any other players so just
like<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:18.400> when<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> gave<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:19.060> money<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
like now when I gave that money to that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.880 
like now when I gave that money to that
random<00:02:19.870> player<00:02:20.080> if<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.440> were<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> happen<00:02:20.650> to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
random player if that were to happen to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.440 
random player if that were to happen to
me<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.220> wouldn't<00:02:21.489> be<00:02:21.580> able<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.790> accept<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
me I wouldn't be able to accept it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.300 
me I wouldn't be able to accept it
plus<00:02:23.170> I've<00:02:23.379> had<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.530> couple<00:02:23.800> times<00:02:23.980> where<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.190> was

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
plus I've had a couple times where I was

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.040 
plus I've had a couple times where I was
like<00:02:24.400> chopping<00:02:24.790> logs<00:02:24.940> or<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.300> bronze<00:02:25.540> axe<00:02:25.840> to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
like chopping logs or the bronze axe to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.720 
like chopping logs or the bronze axe to
say<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.470> someone<00:02:26.709> comes<00:02:26.920> up<00:02:27.099> happens<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.640> have

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
say and someone comes up happens to have

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.820 
say and someone comes up happens to have
an<00:02:27.819> iron<00:02:28.060> axe<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.709> they're

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
an iron axe on them and because they're

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.100 
an iron axe on them and because they're
nice<00:02:30.010> they<00:02:30.220> give<00:02:30.370> me<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.580> better<00:02:30.760> axe<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.750> I'm

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
nice they give me the better axe so I'm

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.660 
nice they give me the better axe so I'm
gonna<00:02:32.260> avoid<00:02:32.500> stuff<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.069> that<00:02:33.250> happening

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
gonna avoid stuff like that happening

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
gonna avoid stuff like that happening
I'm<00:02:33.910> also<00:02:34.120> gonna<00:02:34.390> not<00:02:34.810> keep<00:02:35.019> items<00:02:35.260> from

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
I'm also gonna not keep items from

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.589 
I'm also gonna not keep items from
random<00:02:35.920> events<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.910> even<00:02:37.269> though<00:02:37.330> they<00:02:37.450> don't

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
random events so even though they don't

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.640 
random events so even though they don't
give<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.750> ton<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:37.989> money<00:02:38.200> every<00:02:38.440> once<00:02:38.590> while

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
give a ton of money every once while

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.930 
give a ton of money every once while
they<00:02:38.860> give<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.069> like<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> gold<00:02:39.580> bar<00:02:39.790> or

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
they give you like a gold bar or

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.300 
they give you like a gold bar or
something<00:02:40.299> but<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.230> random<00:02:41.650> event<00:02:41.769> so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
something but it's a random event so

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.130 
something but it's a random event so
that<00:02:42.580> means<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.060> can't<00:02:43.360> control<00:02:43.629> it<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:43.959> it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
that means I can't control it and it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.050 
that means I can't control it and it
wouldn't<00:02:44.319> be<00:02:44.440> repeatable<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.250> I'm<00:02:45.519> gonna<00:02:45.730> stay

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
wouldn't be repeatable so I'm gonna stay

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.979 
wouldn't be repeatable so I'm gonna stay
away<00:02:46.090> from<00:02:46.269> those<00:02:46.480> two

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
away from those two

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.890 
away from those two
