00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
when you're when he shot 260 and I think

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.390 
when you're when he shot 260 and I think
he<00:05:34.430> shot<00:05:34.550> 252<00:05:35.090> second<00:05:35.420> game<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:36.160> you<00:05:37.160> know<00:05:37.250> the

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
he shot 252 second game and you know the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.890 
he shot 252 second game and you know the
title<00:05:37.580> match<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:38.000> happened<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.300> me<00:05:38.420> too<00:05:38.450> it's<00:05:38.810> a

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
title match it happened to me too it's a

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.120 
title match it happened to me too it's a
little<00:05:39.080> more<00:05:39.170> pressure<00:05:39.410> in<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.710> title<00:05:40.040> match

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
little more pressure in a title match

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.520 
little more pressure in a title match
than<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.700> in<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.120> first<00:05:41.330> couple<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.900> I

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
than it is in the first couple and I

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.900 
than it is in the first couple and I
think<00:05:42.740> it's<00:05:42.830> showed<00:05:42.980> by<00:05:43.160> our<00:05:43.280> scores<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.730> last

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
think it's showed by our scores the last

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.240 
think it's showed by our scores the last
game<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.390> but<00:05:45.380> I'm<00:05:45.440> sure<00:05:45.620> he'll<00:05:45.740> be<00:05:45.800> back<00:05:45.860> he's

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
game and but I'm sure he'll be back he's

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.040 
game and but I'm sure he'll be back he's
born<00:05:46.460> three<00:05:46.790> out<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:46.910> four<00:05:47.090> telecasts<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:47.870> mean
