I'd<00:01:50.369> say<00:01:50.430> almost<00:01:50.939> three<00:01:51.630> pounds<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.159> of

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
I'd say almost three pounds so some of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.530 
I'd say almost three pounds so some of
the<00:01:53.369> biggest<00:01:53.549> perch<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.060> I've<00:01:54.210> seen<00:01:54.420> from

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the biggest perch that I've seen from

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 
the biggest perch that I've seen from
Lake<00:01:54.780> Simcoe<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.290> been<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> 15<00:01:56.100> inch

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
Lake Simcoe have been in the 15 inch

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
Lake Simcoe have been in the 15 inch
range<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.270> those<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.570> pretty<00:01:57.750> big<00:01:57.840> perch<00:01:58.259> but

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
range so those are pretty big perch but

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.890 
range so those are pretty big perch but
that's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> perfect<00:01:59.250> eating<00:01:59.400> size<00:01:59.689> you<00:02:00.689> see

that's a perfect eating size you see

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.130 
that's a perfect eating size you see
it's<00:02:01.740> got<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> meat<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.670> them<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.140> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it's got a lot of meat on them and you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.330 
it's got a lot of meat on them and you
know<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.439> I've<00:02:04.560> been<00:02:04.710> keeping<00:02:04.979> some<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> the

know what I've been keeping some of the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.710 
know what I've been keeping some of the
smaller<00:02:05.640> ones<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.150> it's<00:02:06.270> good<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.600> not

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
smaller ones so it's good that I'm not

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.030 
smaller ones so it's good that I'm not
keeping<00:02:06.900> just<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> big<00:02:07.500> perch

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.970 

you<00:02:16.879> know<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.810> had<00:02:17.989> heavier<00:02:18.349> fishing<00:02:18.769> rods

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you know if I had heavier fishing rods

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.800 
you know if I had heavier fishing rods
in<00:02:19.250> my<00:02:19.280> hand<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.819> couldn't<00:02:20.120> hold<00:02:20.299> three<00:02:20.629> of<00:02:20.719> them

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
in my hand I couldn't hold three of them

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.780 
in my hand I couldn't hold three of them

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
like this in my fingers but because

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.580 
like this in my fingers but because
these<00:02:22.939> are<00:02:23.000> ultralight<00:02:23.810> they're<00:02:24.170> very

these are ultralight they're very

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.259 
these are ultralight they're very

ultralights<00:02:46.969> and<00:02:47.299> you'll<00:02:47.810> notice<00:02:48.139> that<00:02:48.379> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
ultralights and you'll notice that the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.559 
ultralights and you'll notice that the
color<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:49.280> line<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.730> blue<00:02:50.150> or<00:02:50.329> yellow

color of the line is blue or yellow

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.809 
color of the line is blue or yellow
that's<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.200> I'm<00:02:51.319> using<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.859> 4-pound<00:02:52.519> test

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
that's because I'm using a 4-pound test

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.240 
that's because I'm using a 4-pound test
braided<00:02:53.359> line<00:02:53.569> which<00:02:54.169> is<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.709> monofilament

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
braided line which is the monofilament

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.170 
braided line which is the monofilament
line<00:02:55.760> diameter<00:02:56.389> of<00:02:56.540> about<00:02:56.659> 1<00:02:57.139> pound<00:02:57.650> test<00:02:58.250> ok

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
line diameter of about 1 pound test ok

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.520 
line diameter of about 1 pound test ok
so<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.599> reason<00:02:59.629> I'm<00:02:59.959> using<00:03:00.109> these<00:03:00.319> light

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
so the reason I'm using these light

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.679 
so the reason I'm using these light
outfits<00:03:00.980> with<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.639> very<00:03:01.849> low<00:03:02.060> diameter<00:03:02.510> line

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
outfits with the very low diameter line

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.629 
outfits with the very low diameter line
is<00:03:02.870> because<00:03:03.019> I'm<00:03:03.319> casting<00:03:03.739> these<00:03:03.950> very<00:03:04.220> small

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
is because I'm casting these very small

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.780 
is because I'm casting these very small
jigs<00:03:05.150> now<00:03:05.840> you'll<00:03:05.989> also<00:03:06.169> notice<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.519> all

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
jigs now you'll also notice that on all

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.360 
jigs now you'll also notice that on all
three<00:03:08.150> rods<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.870> have<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> fluorocarbon<00:03:10.220> leader

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
three rods I have a fluorocarbon leader

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.789 
three rods I have a fluorocarbon leader
so<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:10.879> I<00:03:11.000> hold<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.480> leader<00:03:11.810> that's<00:03:12.500> got<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
so if I hold this leader that's got the

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.009 
so if I hold this leader that's got the
crank<00:03:13.040> bead<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.430> away<00:03:14.180> from<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.540> rod<00:03:14.750> if

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
crank bead on it away from the rod if

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.990 
crank bead on it away from the rod if
you<00:03:15.139> look<00:03:15.349> up<00:03:15.530> here<00:03:15.859> this<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.609> clear

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
you look up here this is clear

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.240 
you look up here this is clear
fluorocarbon<00:03:17.930> again<00:03:18.439> it's<00:03:18.590> light<00:03:18.799> line<00:03:19.010> four

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
fluorocarbon again it's light line four

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.729 
fluorocarbon again it's light line four
pound<00:03:19.519> test<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.659> swivel<00:03:21.290> right<00:03:21.440> there

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
pound test I have a swivel right there

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.159 
pound test I have a swivel right there
and<00:03:21.919> then<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.729> that's<00:03:22.970> my<00:03:23.180> connection<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:24.049> my

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
and then that that's my connection to my

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.259 
and then that that's my connection to my
braided<00:03:24.620> line<00:03:24.829> up<00:03:25.040> top<00:03:25.280> I've<00:03:25.760> done<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
braided line up top I've done that

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.300 
braided line up top I've done that
because<00:03:26.479> my<00:03:26.870> braided<00:03:27.260> line<00:03:27.470> has<00:03:27.739> coloured<00:03:28.159> to

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
because my braided line has coloured to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.159 
because my braided line has coloured to
it<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.639> by<00:03:28.790> using<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.239> light<00:03:29.419> fluorocarbon

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
it so by using a light fluorocarbon

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.349 
it so by using a light fluorocarbon
leader<00:03:30.349> I'm<00:03:30.799> gonna<00:03:31.400> get<00:03:31.579> away<00:03:31.819> from<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.150> fish

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
leader I'm gonna get away from the fish

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.750 
leader I'm gonna get away from the fish
being<00:03:32.989> able<00:03:33.139> to<00:03:33.260> spot<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.769> line<00:03:33.979> now<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.669> this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760

particular<00:03:34.970> rod<00:03:35.479> because<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.810> was<00:03:36.019> casting

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
particular rod because I was casting

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.949 
particular rod because I was casting
lures<00:03:36.919> at<00:03:37.639> like<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.879> crank<00:03:38.180> bait<00:03:38.389> sometimes

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
lures at like a crank bait sometimes

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.659 
lures at like a crank bait sometimes
will<00:03:39.139> spiral<00:03:39.650> if<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.859> gets<00:03:39.979> tangled<00:03:40.159> up<00:03:40.459> or<00:03:40.579> if

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
will spiral if it gets tangled up or if

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:41.589 
will spiral if it gets tangled up or if
has<00:03:40.819> weeds<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.299> it

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
has weeds on it

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.719 
has weeds on it
I<00:03:41.629> put<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.229> swivel<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.799> there<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.639> it

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
I put the swivel in there so that it

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.759 
I put the swivel in there so that it
would<00:03:43.849> take<00:03:44.030> any<00:03:44.239> line<00:03:44.449> twisting<00:03:45.019> out<00:03:45.169> on<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
would take any line twisting out on the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.800 
would take any line twisting out on the
other<00:03:45.919> two<00:03:46.220> rods<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.699> I<00:03:46.760> have<00:03:46.970> here<00:03:47.359> you'll

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
other two rods that I have here you'll

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.390 
other two rods that I have here you'll
notice<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.379> connection<00:03:48.889> is<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.069> blood

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
notice that the connection is a blood

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.219 
notice that the connection is a blood
knot<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:49.849> if<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.000> look<00:03:50.180> right<00:03:50.209> here<00:03:50.449> there's

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
knot so if you look right here there's

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.189 
knot so if you look right here there's
no<00:03:51.530> swivel<00:03:52.099> it<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:52.579> goes<00:03:52.790> from<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:53.199> titanium

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
no swivel it just goes from the titanium

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.800 
no swivel it just goes from the titanium
braid<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:55.430> makes<00:03:55.729> a<00:03:55.819> transition<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
braid it makes a transition to the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.110 
braid it makes a transition to the
fluorocarbon<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.010> that's<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.370> blood<00:03:58.609> knot<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
fluorocarbon so that's a blood knot and

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.240 
fluorocarbon so that's a blood knot and
it's<00:03:59.269> literally<00:03:59.629> invisible<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.069> if<00:04:01.129> you're

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
it's literally invisible so if you're

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.610 
it's literally invisible so if you're
planning<00:04:01.459> on<00:04:01.609> catching<00:04:01.849> panfish<00:04:02.659> especially

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
planning on catching panfish especially

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.409 
planning on catching panfish especially
eating<00:04:03.829> size<00:04:04.220> ones<00:04:04.669> you<00:04:04.970> know<00:04:05.060> anywhere<00:04:05.329> from

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
eating size ones you know anywhere from

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.469 
eating size ones you know anywhere from
about<00:04:05.629> 6<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.349> 13<00:04:06.829> inches<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.459> really<00:04:08.120> helps<00:04:08.419> to

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
about 6 to 13 inches it really helps to

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.290 
about 6 to 13 inches it really helps to
have<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.659> right<00:04:08.870> outfit
