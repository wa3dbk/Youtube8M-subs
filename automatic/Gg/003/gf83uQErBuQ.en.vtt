until<00:01:36.159> like<00:01:36.249> a<00:01:36.279> week<00:01:36.399> later<00:01:36.819> so<00:01:37.240> it's<00:01:37.359> good<00:01:37.509> to

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
until like a week later so it's good to

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.749 
until like a week later so it's good to

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
the following week because the goal is
