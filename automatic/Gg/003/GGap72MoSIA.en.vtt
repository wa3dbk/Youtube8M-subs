00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
use somebody else guilted at lower but i

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
use somebody else guilted at lower but i
don't<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.300> prefer<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.930> have<00:02:13.050> my

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
don't really like it prefer to have my

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.670 
don't really like it prefer to have my
own

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
own

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.170 
own
so<00:02:14.099> that's<00:02:14.310> why<00:02:14.579> I<00:02:14.609> bought<00:02:15.859> 30,000<00:02:16.859> old<00:02:17.730> planks

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
so that's why I bought 30,000 old planks

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.970 
so that's why I bought 30,000 old planks
with<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.689> amount<00:02:18.930> i<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.409> get<00:02:19.590> about<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
with that amount i can get about the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.289 
with that amount i can get about the
wall<00:02:20.189> 80<00:02:20.939> I<00:02:21.590> think<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.920> at<00:02:23.459> level<00:02:23.730> 80<00:02:23.969> I<00:02:24.090> will

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
wall 80 I think and at level 80 I will

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.319 
wall 80 I think and at level 80 I will
actually<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.989> first<00:02:25.379> page<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.329> construction

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
actually be first page in construction

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.110 
actually be first page in construction
so<00:02:27.959> very<00:02:28.319> good<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.950> I've<00:02:29.519> also<00:02:29.819> been

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
considering if i should go all the way

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.509 
considering if i should go all the way
with<00:02:32.370> construction<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.389> get<00:02:33.989> myself<00:02:34.519> 99

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
with construction and get myself 99

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.149 
with construction and get myself 99
constriction<00:02:36.239> or<00:02:36.359> even<00:02:36.629> better<00:02:36.930> be<00:02:37.560> ranked<00:02:37.859> 1

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
constriction or even better be ranked 1

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.890 
constriction or even better be ranked 1

for<00:03:37.530> 9<00:03:37.680> a-9<00:03:37.829> constriction<00:03:38.819> but<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.180> could<00:03:39.479> also

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
for 9 a-9 constriction but I could also

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.589 
for 9 a-9 constriction but I could also
go<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.290> rank<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:41.010> prayer<00:03:41.609> but<00:03:42.479> the

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
go for rank on prayer but the

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.860 
go for rank on prayer but the
competition<00:03:43.169> in<00:03:43.290> prayer<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.769> for<00:03:44.479> higher<00:03:45.479> than

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
competition in prayer is for higher than

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.099 
competition in prayer is for higher than
in<00:03:46.049> construction<00:03:46.709> construction<00:03:47.009> it's<00:03:47.489> just

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
in construction construction it's just

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.199 
in construction construction it's just
well<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.229> be<00:03:49.349> first<00:03:49.650> page<00:03:49.949> it's<00:03:50.250> very<00:03:50.759> very

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
well to be first page it's very very

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.860 
well to be first page it's very very
easy<00:03:52.009> so<00:03:53.009> I<00:03:53.040> guess<00:03:53.189> that's<00:03:53.669> pretty<00:03:54.479> much<00:03:54.810> it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
easy so I guess that's pretty much it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.860 
easy so I guess that's pretty much it
about<00:03:55.439> my<00:03:55.650> bank<00:03:56.129> I<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:56.609> really<00:03:56.759> have<00:03:56.879> tons

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
about my bank I don't really have tons

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.890 
about my bank I don't really have tons
of<00:03:58.049> things<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.949> show<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.370> guys<00:03:59.459> I'm<00:04:00.060> I'm

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
of things to show you guys I'm I'm

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.619 
of things to show you guys I'm I'm
continuing<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.949> Train<00:04:02.280> forming<00:04:03.290> 85<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:05.629> a

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
continuing to Train forming 85 and a

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.229 
continuing to Train forming 85 and a
little<00:04:06.930> bit<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.370> crafting<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.459> course<00:04:08.879> making

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
little bit of crafting of course making

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.449 
little bit of crafting of course making
a<00:04:09.299> good<00:04:09.479> profit<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:10.199> guess<00:04:10.530> that's<00:04:10.859> pretty<00:04:11.280> much

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
a good profit I guess that's pretty much

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.019 
a good profit I guess that's pretty much
it<00:04:11.639> so<00:04:12.060> say<00:04:12.900> up
