 batman against all let's call this movie 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.210
 so and of course the final Minsk itself 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.519

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 battles and find out 1 with the champion of this 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 years in the discipline of team 842 world of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.370
 tanks and so fight rhinos 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.160
 go to the city that you have my greens 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.789
 greens at mirror setup i'm trying 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.460
 understand which bag is atmospheric, I understand 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.800
 and everyone understands what this is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 round against the fountain so this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.110
 fountain here are games from the fountain with 90 fluting 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.340
 aggressive which is for the light and attempt 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.609
 shot through the greens 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.589
 have a hit see him go away 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 discharged, see nothing 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.840
 it turned out arc pick up option 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.659
 of course there is a pay understand 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.509
 return humana also return baku 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.250
 2 tanks returned in green for three tanks 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.740
 digging in plus you one komola when 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.430
 first line i went to the bar all guys 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.360
 but all this is no longer a victory for us 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.670
 the form there are action movies 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 win it if they go toe themselves 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.320
 attack either warmer attack I understand 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.119
 that they can lose and merge 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
 it will merge the new plugin where guys 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.090
 which will merge and take us back roots given 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 last fight where they played everything on 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.560
 Verachka and move chic not in a hurry but 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.210
 maybe someone will risk maybe 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 rhinoceros go grab but about this we 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.140
 we learn only on the last two minutes of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.549
 this round a brigade of those who recently 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.649
 joined reminds live 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.750
 wargaming.net leagues gold playoff series 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 online playoffs of the first season and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.219
 played the last slot on 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.979
 lan final the winner of this match goes to 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.240
 Minsk of course there will be cool 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.369
 cool final chic 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.469
 Well, in principle, everything is as always but the most 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.689
 most importantly who will go whether le play 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.450
 whether to make a splash 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.950
 through this whole meat grinder and beat 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.319
 such famous guys like her soon 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.480
 which is us this season 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.260
 valine but again I want to break in this 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.239
 look at the storm on the sandy river 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.849
 bored of course looked all the same 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.700
 for fights where guys fight in the first 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.150
 minutes yes yes yes just geronimo im 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.540
 what is being decided seriously now 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.639
 such a part for destiny's commands even a part 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.139
 but this is the result of the whole season, that is 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.629
 it doesn't even matter what was important before 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.849
 how are you going to spend this very district 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.909
 same we understand that at the lan final in 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.590
 Basically, I'm absolutely sure 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.389
 friend I just you think that she is like 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.849
 once it is on the land final there will be 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.310
 very many cats post very unexpected 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.989
 and tigers aggressive interesting sapper 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.150
 tactics and strategies and I can also stand 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.709
 look well as if no matter how 50 on 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.129
 50 that the match will be very interesting 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.459
 honest transformations that in the end everything 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.099
 it will be hot anyway but here is our team 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.560
 as a unity one fight once you stood 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.030
 everything is good there are commands like nari which 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.799
 Here, too, I need you because they are on the map 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.019
 won there is a team as might 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:19.970
 I believe that you give that command 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.430
 Meane , for some reason, I did, of course 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.290
 hung June with a look see guys 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.810
 Here in this and interesting tanks command 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.180
 fight that a lot of layouts who 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.129
 will win how will win but really it 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.169
 all show tankers themselves on the lan final 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.299
 how will the one prepared 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.849
 psychologically more prepared who is there 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.889
 tactically who has the level of the game just 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.239
 above all we will know very soon 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:46.030
 but then again I want to say it again and 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.829
 I want to watch a tiebreak and I donâ€™t really want to 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.540
 it will be a tiebreak where 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.500
 everyone except the cards will only give you 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.120
 say that while it is given that 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.919
 what is happening now on the first map 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.229
 tried on impudent and those and others 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.180
 somewhere by mistaken somewhere could 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.829
 looks could lose in the end draw 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.989
 Now card that achieved a draw 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.780
 here nothing comes at all 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.419
 the way that the meteorite falls on the fan center 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.909
 cards and there is formed a base not on it not 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.130
 sings on a base grab as this is not 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.019
 very option this yes in general we 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.549
 see how rhinos are located in the city 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.889
 obviously not going to attack 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.389
 account 00 so far they are comfortable with it 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.099
 only the first with is just the beginning 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.970
 team meetings shoot each other 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.340
 watch a friend 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.860
 and of course all the fun 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.930
 will go somewhere in the second set but in 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.910
 In principle, we are not immune from the fact that 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.610
 The first will be cool cool cards 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.500
 strategy tactics rounds or some 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.690
 interesting unpredictable moments we 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.970
 love it too but tie-break tie-break 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.340
 very helpful among all couples in this match 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.780
 just a big version of what 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.660
 maybe play it up to that time 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.300
 Magpie Tatyana I agree very high 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.090
 even yesterday's part of today 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.740
 of the day where teams played there probabilities 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.050
 the fact that we will have just sandy 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.850
 the river with the storm it was minimal here 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.350
 in this meeting, I even for some reason 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.420
 I will stop more and more confidently 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.980
 that it will be so that gerbil 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.340
 we are going here even a couple of times 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.220
 a couple of times it's such that we will severely couple 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.310
 just look gerbil this and just to 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.430
 World Cup finals and okay 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.410
 hunger well well brumberg smoke break 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.570
 tank crews they went for the sandwiches 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.490
 discuss strategy tactics nobody 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.430
 forcing an event that's not even like an arcade 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.550
 attack in the last seconds of two minutes 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.710
 exactly we and whipley are afraid to go into 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.140
 city on the gathering of rhinos are afraid to go in 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.790
 the greens and in general the power of Ruslan 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.680
 once again now 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.690
 shown on this map which is very 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.400
 hard to attack from below and lower base 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.070
 prefers to play more carefully even 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.669
 top teams don't allow themselves 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.610
 Such a risk in the most part plays 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:56.690
 protecting just the bottom base and here it is 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.210
 attempt at 40 minute to move and go 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.840
 in the center of the city shoot but also 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.960
 still need to find in general this event 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.900
 there are always more of us 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.360
 nothing just see what they do 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.660
 teams and what they are trying to achieve 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.090
 minute 17 contact no fungus whether they go 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.910
 only 1 out of 3 is entering the city 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.440
 human kate well, everything is far away, that is 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:26.510
 one tank until we can sort it 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.419
 there is active war and so minute 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.860
 somewhere remains with us yes that's the minute 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.960
 a minute and at least some contact 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.560
 it will happen here 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.380
 contact on the minute 55 seconds remain where 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.830
 all tanks are not clear there is not even 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:47.419
 shoot just ahead guys scouting 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:51.099
 torn capture an attempt to do something a 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:55.400
 that this question is probably not the main 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:58.039
 players for us all with you dear 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.590
 friends lying well all not all do not be sad 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.960
 will be okay i believe that in any 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.000
 case we watch open cards with us 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.250
 there is a variant of the described river tai break and 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.729
 what will be on Thai and we all 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.320
 It turns out the pressure on and of course will check 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.150
 Oleg at least try to know this one 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.580
 hastily that in the last battle defended and 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.870
 took place here 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.400
 Well wipley still do in 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.380
 maximum work which is possible they 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.630
 now learned here are about positions 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.940
 alignment of rhinos at the bottom base and 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.009
 maybe there in the second set either in 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.069
 third either on an extra card they 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.810
 will play just as well well why 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:34.810
 no be some information
