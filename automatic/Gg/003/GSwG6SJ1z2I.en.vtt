00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
wrap around the waste yarn will create a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.520 
wrap around the waste yarn will create a
new<00:01:46.390> stitch<00:01:46.660> which<00:01:46.870> you<00:01:46.990> can<00:01:47.140> catch<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.500> a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
new stitch which you can catch on a

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.760 
new stitch which you can catch on a
circular<00:01:47.800> needle<00:01:48.220> as<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.430> do<00:01:48.550> as<00:01:48.730> you<00:01:48.880> go<00:01:49.060> an

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
circular needle as you do as you go an

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.230 
circular needle as you do as you go an
even<00:01:50.770> easier<00:01:51.070> way<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.490> make<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.910> cast<00:01:52.120> on

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
even easier way to make this cast on

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.380 
even easier way to make this cast on
happen<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:53.260> take<00:01:53.590> your<00:01:53.820> waste<00:01:54.820> or<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.210> take

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
happen is to take your waste or to take

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.949 
again and you definitely want to make
sure<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.790> you're<00:03:39.940> picking<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.450> bump

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
sure that you're picking up that bump

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.110 
sure that you're picking up that bump
and<00:03:41.170> only<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.739> bump<00:03:41.980> because<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:42.970> pick

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
and only that bump because if you pick

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.550 
and only that bump because if you pick
up<00:03:43.269> anything<00:03:43.480> else<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.930> won't<00:03:44.140> be<00:03:44.260> able<00:03:44.410> to

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
up anything else you won't be able to

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.150 
up anything else you won't be able to
unravel<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.430> chain<00:03:45.670> neatly<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:47.200> when<00:03:47.920> you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
unravel the chain neatly so when you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.390 
unravel the chain neatly so when you
come<00:03:48.400> when<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.730> comes<00:03:48.910> time<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:50.040> work<00:03:51.040> back<00:03:51.250> at

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
come when it comes time to work back at

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.070 
come when it comes time to work back at
the<00:03:51.519> other<00:03:51.640> end<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> work<00:03:52.330> you're<00:03:52.900> going

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
the other end of the work you're going

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.630 
the other end of the work you're going
to<00:03:53.170> unravel<00:03:53.650> your<00:03:53.769> chain<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.280> I've<00:03:54.430> done

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
to unravel your chain and what I've done

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.130 
to unravel your chain and what I've done
is<00:03:54.700> I've<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.269> when<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:55.630> finished<00:03:55.959> off<00:03:56.110> my

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
is I've just when I finished off my

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.740 
is I've just when I finished off my
chain<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:56.890> simply<00:03:57.430> pass<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.880> tail<00:03:58.510> end<00:03:58.690> of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
chain I just simply pass the tail end of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.410 
chain I just simply pass the tail end of
the<00:03:58.840> yarn<00:03:59.019> through<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.560> pull<00:04:00.130> tight<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:01.329> I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the yarn through and pull tight and I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.390 
the yarn through and pull tight and I
put<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> knot<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.079> that<00:04:02.440> end<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.130> tail

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
put a knot in that end of the tail

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.370 
put a knot in that end of the tail
because<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.000> will<00:04:04.269> tell<00:04:04.750> me<00:04:04.900> which<00:04:05.019> end<00:04:05.290> to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
because that will tell me which end to

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.690 
because that will tell me which end to
start<00:04:05.590> unraveling<00:04:05.860> from<00:04:06.220> since<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.549> work

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
start unraveling from since the work

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.850 
start unraveling from since the work
will<00:04:06.880> only<00:04:07.030> unravel<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.600> one<00:04:07.750> direction<00:04:07.900> so

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
will only unravel in one direction so

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.770 
will only unravel in one direction so
what<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.160> want<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.370> do<00:04:09.459> now<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.880> just<00:04:10.180> unpick

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
what you want to do now is just unpick

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.879 
what you want to do now is just unpick
unpick<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:14.220> tied<00:04:15.220> off<00:04:15.400> end

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.600 

make<00:04:19.549> this<00:04:19.759> happen

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.360 

there<00:04:25.210> we<00:04:25.360> go<00:04:25.479> you're<00:04:26.110> just<00:04:26.349> going<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.560> unravel

there we go you're just going to unravel

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.300 
there we go you're just going to unravel
and<00:04:27.520> these<00:04:28.060> coils<00:04:28.960> would<00:04:29.229> show<00:04:29.560> as<00:04:29.830> just<00:04:30.129> live

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
and these coils would show as just live

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.730 
and these coils would show as just live
