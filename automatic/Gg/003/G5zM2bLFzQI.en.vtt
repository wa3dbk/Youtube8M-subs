absolutely<00:03:09.540> stupid<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.110> have<00:03:10.260> never<00:03:10.680> heard<00:03:10.980> of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
absolutely stupid I have never heard of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.090 
absolutely stupid I have never heard of
anything<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.739> don't<00:03:13.950> think

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
anything like that I really don't think

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.140 
anything like that I really don't think
a<00:03:14.580> team<00:03:15.180> would<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.630> throw<00:03:16.230> away<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.739> game<00:03:17.190> just

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
a team would just throw away a game just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.810 
a team would just throw away a game just
so<00:03:18.269> they'll<00:03:18.420> avoid<00:03:19.100> temporarily<00:03:20.100> playing

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
so they'll avoid temporarily playing

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.039 
so they'll avoid temporarily playing
against<00:03:21.060> EG<00:03:21.420> i<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:21.900> absolutely

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
against EG i think that's absolutely

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.410 
against EG i think that's absolutely
absurd<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.459> yeah<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> lot<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.000> people<00:03:24.299> were

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
absurd but yeah a lot of people were

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.810 
absurd but yeah a lot of people were
believing<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.900> for<00:03:25.079> some<00:03:25.200> reason<00:03:25.820> anyway

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
believing that for some reason anyway

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.660 
believing that for some reason anyway
moving<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.299> from<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.230> optic<00:03:28.620> gaming<00:03:28.769> came

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
moving on from that so optic gaming came

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.580 
moving on from that so optic gaming came
out<00:03:29.820> really<00:03:30.239> strong<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.780> game<00:03:30.959> whether<00:03:31.140> NV

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
out really strong that game whether NV

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.470 
out really strong that game whether NV
threw<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.070> away<00:03:32.160> or<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.519> i<00:03:32.549> really<00:03:33.000> doubt<00:03:33.120> NV

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
threw it away or not i really doubt NV

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.390 
threw it away or not i really doubt NV
did<00:03:33.690> but<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.829> know<00:03:34.890> i'm<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> assume

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
did but you know i'm going to assume

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.430 
did but you know i'm going to assume
that<00:03:35.850> they<00:03:36.090> played<00:03:36.420> their<00:03:36.570> best<00:03:36.780> which<00:03:37.410> is

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that they played their best which is

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.289 
that they played their best which is

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.610 
and yeah the last domination again was
pretty<00:04:17.430> close<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.090> optic<00:04:19.019> actually<00:04:19.350> made<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
pretty close and optic actually made the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.409 
pretty close and optic actually made the
comeback<00:04:20.040> on<00:04:20.190> strike<00:04:20.519> zone<00:04:20.730> down<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:21.120> win<00:04:21.269> that

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
comeback on strike zone down to win that

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.820 
comeback on strike zone down to win that
so<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.720> was<00:04:21.810> actually<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.169> really<00:04:22.440> good<00:04:22.680> game

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
so that was actually a really good game

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.420 
so that was actually a really good game
to<00:04:23.010> watch<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.690> optic<00:04:24.690> advance<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.440> or

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
to watch and optic advance so or

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.070 
to watch and optic advance so or
actually<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:26.760> guess<00:04:26.910> they<00:04:27.360> both<00:04:27.600> events<00:04:27.870> but
