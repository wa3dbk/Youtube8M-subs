00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and basically it's going to be a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
and basically it's going to be a
reimagining<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> reefs<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.460> going

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to be a different story different easter

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
to be a different story different easter
eggs<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.530> stuff<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.340> i<00:00:35.940> figure

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
eggs and stuff like that and i figure

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.729 
eggs and stuff like that and i figure
that<00:00:36.480> since<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:37.230> something<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.680> this

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that since there was something like this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
that since there was something like this
coming<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> game<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.300> maybe<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.899> were

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
coming to the game that maybe there were

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
coming to the game that maybe there were
some<00:00:40.020> clues<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.530> maybe<00:00:40.980> there<00:00:41.190> were<00:00:41.219> something

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
some clues or maybe there were something

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
some clues or maybe there were something
on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.149> older<00:00:42.629> e<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.110> could<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
on the older e so we could look at and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
on the older e so we could look at and
find<00:00:44.219> different<00:00:44.550> easter<00:00:44.879> eggs<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.239> even

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
find different easter eggs because even

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
find different easter eggs because even
the<00:00:45.809> developers<00:00:46.320> themselves<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:47.280> said<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the developers themselves have said that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.040

decided to go ahead and no clip in the
game<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.940> if<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.120> could<00:00:54.180> find<00:00:54.300> anything<00:00:54.600> i

teleports<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> different<00:01:25.049> areas<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
teleports you to different areas and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
teleports you to different areas and
free<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.430> ether<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> or

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
free as i don't know what ether is or

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
free as i don't know what ether is or
what<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> ether<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.650> place<00:01:28.920> between

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
what the ether is it's a place between

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.670 
what the ether is it's a place between
dimensions<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.869> easiest<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.439> i<00:01:31.470> could

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
dimensions so the easiest way i could

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
dimensions so the easiest way i could
make<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.890> understand<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
make you understand this is when you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.460 
make you understand this is when you
take<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.390> toll<00:01:33.659> apporter<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
take a toll apporter when you're in that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
take a toll apporter when you're in that
little<00:01:34.829> wormhole<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.700> its<00:01:35.790> teleporting<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
little wormhole or its teleporting you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
little wormhole or its teleporting you
through<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.170> area<00:01:37.560> where<00:01:37.920> you're

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
through that area where you're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
through that area where you're
teleporting<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.270> easier<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
teleporting through is easier that's the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
teleporting through is easier that's the
place<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.009> between<00:01:41.340> dimensions<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
place that's between dimensions and you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
place that's between dimensions and you
know<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.020> what's<00:01:43.290> used<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.920> teleport<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
know it's what's used to teleport and go

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
know it's what's used to teleport and go
through<00:01:45.119> time<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> teleport<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> different

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
through time and teleport to different

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
through time and teleport to different
areas<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.310> definitely<00:01:48.000> something<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> we

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
areas it's definitely something that we

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
areas it's definitely something that we
have<00:01:49.110> gotten<00:01:49.409> used<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.009> throughout<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
have gotten used to throughout the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
have gotten used to throughout the
development<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.540> call<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> zombies<00:01:52.500> we've

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
development of call to zombies we've

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.440 
development of call to zombies we've
gotten<00:01:52.950> used<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.490> teleporting<00:01:54.149> what

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
gotten used to it with teleporting what

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.200 
gotten used to it with teleporting what
if<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.560> wasn't<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.040> reference<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.759> using<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
if this wasn't a reference to using the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.389 
if this wasn't a reference to using the
teleporters<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.290> maybe<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> message

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
teleporters but maybe it was a message

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
teleporters but maybe it was a message
that<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.759> written<00:01:59.969> before<00:02:00.210> by<00:02:00.659> someone<00:02:01.290> in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that was written before by someone in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
that was written before by someone in
order<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> remind<00:02:02.610> themselves<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:03.990> through

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
order to remind themselves to go through

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
order to remind themselves to go through
the<00:02:04.409> ether<00:02:04.799> return<00:02:05.280> through<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> ether

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the ether return through the ether

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.520 
the ether return through the ether
already<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.020> got<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.290> wheel

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
already just kind of got my wheel

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050 
already just kind of got my wheel
spinning<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> made<00:02:08.429> me<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.879> why

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
spinning because it made me think why

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.490 
spinning because it made me think why
would<00:02:09.209> someone<00:02:09.450> write<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.929> down<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
would someone write that down on the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
would someone write that down on the
wall<00:02:10.709> why<00:02:10.979> would<00:02:11.129> someone<00:02:11.340> write<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.849> return

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
wall why would someone write down return

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.170 
wall why would someone write down return
ether<00:02:13.110> unless<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.770> was<00:02:13.860> someone<00:02:14.250> who<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.730> stuck

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
ether unless it was someone who is stuck

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.550 
ether unless it was someone who is stuck
maybe<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.720> loop<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.230> they're<00:02:16.320> telling

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
maybe in a loop and they're telling

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.990 
maybe in a loop and they're telling
themselves<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.220> they<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.820> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
themselves that they have to do this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.910 
themselves that they have to do this
that<00:02:18.210> they<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.720> return<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.560> point

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that they have to return to this point

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.860 
that they have to return to this point
in<00:02:20.160> time<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> don't<00:02:21.210> really<00:02:21.240> know<00:02:21.480> maybe

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
in time so I don't really know maybe

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.660 
in time so I don't really know maybe
that<00:02:21.990> explains<00:02:22.200> why<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.680> older<00:02:23.100> crew<00:02:23.340> showed

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
that explains why the older crew showed

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.460 
that explains why the older crew showed
up<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.000> here<00:02:24.360> well<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.020> something<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.380> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
up on here well but it's something and I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.810 
up on here well but it's something and I
find<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.710> was<00:02:25.890> pretty<00:02:26.070> interesting<00:02:26.370> let<00:02:26.760> me

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
find that was pretty interesting let me

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.130 
find that was pretty interesting let me
know<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> guys<00:02:27.150> think<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> comments

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
know what you guys think in the comments

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110 
know what you guys think in the comments
section<00:02:28.170> below<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.640> figured<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.970> would<00:02:30.090> be

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
section below I just figured it would be

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.450 
section below I just figured it would be
something<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.650> mention<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.800> see<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.250> there's

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
something to mention and see if there's

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.010 
something to mention and see if there's
anything<00:02:32.640> worth<00:02:32.850> exploring<00:02:33.270> there<00:02:33.570> but<00:02:33.990> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
anything worth exploring there but I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.210 
anything worth exploring there but I
