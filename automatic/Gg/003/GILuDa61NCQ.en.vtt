the 12 to 35 millimeter lens this is the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.100 
the 12 to 35 millimeter lens this is the

has a micro 4/3 sensor not the largest

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270 
has a micro 4/3 sensor not the largest
on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> market<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.710> dwarfed<00:01:44.130> by

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on the market and it's dwarfed by

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
on the market and it's dwarfed by
full-frame<00:01:44.820> sensors<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> a7<00:01:46.409> s<00:01:46.590> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
full-frame sensors like on the a7 s but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
full-frame sensors like on the a7 s but
for<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.369> purposes<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.240> youtube<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.960> think

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
for my purposes here on youtube I think

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
for my purposes here on youtube I think
it's<00:01:49.409> perfect<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.100> always<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.759> controlled

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's perfect I always have controlled

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.050 
it's perfect I always have controlled
lighting<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.470> biggest<00:01:52.799> feature<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
lighting and the biggest feature which I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.340 
lighting and the biggest feature which I
think<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.689> important<00:01:55.170> especially

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
think is really important especially

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.249 
think is really important especially
