my hands which was absolutely terrifying

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.210 
my hands which was absolutely terrifying
but<00:02:39.980> after<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.400> happened<00:02:41.950> normally<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:42.980> would

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
but after that happened normally I would

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.350 
but after that happened normally I would
have<00:02:43.340> been<00:02:43.460> a<00:02:43.490> bit<00:02:43.670> freaked<00:02:43.940> out<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.300> I

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
have been a bit freaked out and I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.670 
have been a bit freaked out and I
wouldn't<00:02:44.540> have<00:02:44.630> gone<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.930> done<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.080> again<00:02:45.200> but

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
wouldn't have gone and done it again but

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.140 
wouldn't have gone and done it again but
it<00:02:45.830> was<00:02:45.890> competition<00:02:46.250> day<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.790> went<00:02:46.880> right

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it was competition day so I went right

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.640 
it was competition day so I went right
back<00:02:47.300> up<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.630> did<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.870> again<00:02:47.900> because<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.470> had

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
back up and did it again because I had

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.640 
back up and did it again because I had
to<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.520> know<00:02:49.670> get<00:02:49.910> back<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.300> horse<00:02:50.650> as

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.220 
to you know get back on the horse as
they<00:02:51.860> say<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.090> did<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.420> straightaway<00:02:53.810> after

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
they say so I did it straightaway after

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.070 
they say so I did it straightaway after
and<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.560> was<00:02:54.680> fine<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:56.600> obviously<00:02:56.660> was<00:02:57.050> a

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
and it was fine but obviously was a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.720 
and it was fine but obviously was a
little<00:02:57.319> bit<00:02:57.410> scary<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.069> then<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.370> slipped<00:02:58.580> up

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
little bit scary and then I slipped up

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.580 
little bit scary and then I slipped up
the<00:02:58.880> stairs<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.510> then<00:02:59.900> I<00:02:59.990> threw<00:03:00.200> my<00:03:00.319> chamois

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
the stairs and then I threw my chamois

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.900 
the stairs and then I threw my chamois
down<00:03:00.770> off<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:00.950> 10<00:03:01.220> meter<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.610> hit<00:03:01.700> one<00:03:01.819> of

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
down off of 10 meter and it hit one of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.910 
down off of 10 meter and it hit one of
the<00:03:01.970> Canadian<00:03:02.330> divers<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> head<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.470> you

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
the Canadian divers on the head so you

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.320 
the Canadian divers on the head so you
know<00:03:04.040> they<00:03:04.190> say<00:03:04.400> bad<00:03:04.700> things<00:03:04.970> happening

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
know they say bad things happening

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.350 
know they say bad things happening
through<00:03:05.600> youth<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:05.959> certainly<00:03:06.290> did<00:03:07.360> so

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
through youth and it certainly did so

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.630 
through youth and it certainly did so
then<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.510> went<00:03:08.660> into<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.870> semi-finals<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.890> won

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
then I went into the semi-finals I won

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.170 
then I went into the semi-finals I won
my<00:03:10.790> semi-final<00:03:12.370> qualify<00:03:13.370> for<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.610> final<00:03:13.970> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
my semi-final qualify for the final and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.179 
my semi-final qualify for the final and
was<00:03:14.330> pretty<00:03:14.510> happy<00:03:14.810> with<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.080> but<00:03:15.920> then<00:03:16.010> got

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
was pretty happy with that but then got

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.750 
was pretty happy with that but then got
into<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.400> fine

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
into the fine

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.080 
into the fine
and<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.930> my<00:03:18.709> first<00:03:18.980> dive<00:03:19.250> didn't<00:03:19.550> open<00:03:19.760> up<00:03:19.879> very

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
and I my first dive didn't open up very

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.110 
and I my first dive didn't open up very
strong<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.590> was<00:03:21.799> automatically<00:03:22.430> like<00:03:22.700> 25

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
strong so I was automatically like 25

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.940 
strong so I was automatically like 25
points<00:03:23.480> down<00:03:23.629> on<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.840> rest<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.140> field<00:03:24.379> but

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
points down on the rest of the field but

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.649 
points down on the rest of the field but
I<00:03:24.980> slowly<00:03:25.280> was<00:03:25.459> gradually<00:03:25.849> getting<00:03:26.180> back<00:03:26.360> and

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
I slowly was gradually getting back and

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.600 
I slowly was gradually getting back and
I<00:03:26.720> got<00:03:26.930> eight<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> half's<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.650> my<00:03:27.799> new

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
and a half Pike which was the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.220 
and a half Pike which was the
highest-scoring<00:03:36.860> dive<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.790> competition

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
highest-scoring dive of that competition

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.330 
highest-scoring dive of that competition
which<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.319> was<00:03:39.410> really<00:03:39.500> happy<00:03:39.739> with<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.190> then<00:03:40.280> I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
which I was really happy with but then I

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.190 
which I was really happy with but then I
missed<00:03:40.549> my<00:03:41.239> reverse<00:03:41.540> three<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> half<00:03:42.080> a

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
missed my reverse three and a half a

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.770 
missed my reverse three and a half a
little<00:03:42.290> bit<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.120> 527<00:03:44.120> was<00:03:44.239> what<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:44.420> ended<00:03:44.690> up

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
little bit and 527 was what I ended up

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.780 
little bit and 527 was what I ended up
scoring<00:03:45.110> which<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> pretty<00:03:45.980> decent<00:03:46.069> score

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
scoring which is a pretty decent score

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.050 
scoring which is a pretty decent score
so<00:03:47.360> I'm<00:03:47.450> happy<00:03:47.840> with<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.019> but<00:03:48.530> fifth<00:03:49.040> place<00:03:49.280> was

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
so I'm happy with it but fifth place was

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.880 
so I'm happy with it but fifth place was
where<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.209> finished<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.260> was<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> little<00:03:51.680> bit

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
where I finished so it was a little bit

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.009 
where I finished so it was a little bit
frustrating<00:03:52.519> with<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.209> way<00:03:53.360> that<00:03:53.569> it<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> day

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
frustrating with the way that it the day

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.800 
frustrating with the way that it the day
planned<00:03:54.319> out<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:55.670> lots<00:03:56.299> of<00:03:56.420> positive<00:03:56.750> to

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
planned out but a lots of positive to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.240 
planned out but a lots of positive to
take<00:03:56.959> away<00:03:57.140> from<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:57.859> I'm<00:03:57.980> really

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.619
