could dream I caught this lift my
inspirational<00:04:39.470> look<00:04:39.620> obviously<00:04:40.190> it's<00:04:40.280> not

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
inspirational look obviously it's not

something<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.850> you'd<00:04:40.970> want<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.240> wear<00:04:41.330> on<00:04:41.390> a

something that you'd want to wear on a
daily<00:04:41.660> basis<00:04:42.140> but<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.350> think<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.740> great

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
daily basis but I think it's a great

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.530 
daily basis but I think it's a great
outfit<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.340> get<00:04:43.460> bits<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:43.790> pieces<00:04:44.060> from<00:04:44.330> and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
outfit to get bits and pieces from and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.420 
outfit to get bits and pieces from and
create<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> more<00:04:44.930> casual<00:04:45.320> version<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:45.980> like

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
create a more casual version of it like

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.980 
create a more casual version of it like
I<00:04:46.550> really<00:04:46.730> love<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.090> flower<00:04:47.330> headband<00:04:47.780> but

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
I really love the flower headband but

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.240 
I really love the flower headband but
I'd<00:04:48.080> probably<00:04:48.320> wear<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.680> with<00:04:48.830> something<00:04:49.010> a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
I'd probably wear it with something a

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.770 
I'd probably wear it with something a
little<00:04:49.550> more<00:04:49.580> casual<00:04:50.120> than<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.390> super

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
little more casual than the super

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.890 
little more casual than the super
colorful<00:04:51.080> skirt

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.420

but overall I think that this is a very

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.549 
but overall I think that this is a very
beautiful<00:05:01.729> boho<00:05:02.240> inspired<00:05:02.569> outfit<00:05:03.289> and<00:05:03.499> I
