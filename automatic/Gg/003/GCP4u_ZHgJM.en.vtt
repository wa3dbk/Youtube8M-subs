00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.500
 well, this would be the case of a 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.269
 phone that gets to repair to sun and is 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.090
 in this case 73 that is a team 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.040
 resistant 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.140
 the first verification that is done is 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.630
 If the team has a blow or some 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.970
 type of visible abuse that can 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.860
 invalidate the guarantee in this case of what 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.230
 that the team is perfect does not have 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.270
 no visible blow the caps are 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.790
 correctly they are in their place is 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.300
 all perfect then one time 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.820
 verified this if there are a few witnesses of 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.850
 moisture that are hidden beneath 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.290
 some connectors that is verified that 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.210
 this verifies if the equipment has been not 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.610
 has been in contact with water if you have not 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.080
 been in contact with water of the witness 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.820
 it is white and if it has been in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.250
 contact with water is red 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.149
 in this case where are those witnesses 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.530
 they are talking are are difficult to see 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.540
 they are very difficult to see and I say no 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.370
 I do not think the image comes out 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.350
 then this is already we have already 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.490
 verified that the witness is in color 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.870
 red then if it 's in red that 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.820
 means that if you have been in contact 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.800
 with and that means that he has purple 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.030
 that water has entered the team is what 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.500
 unique that is inferior to the sae if it is for 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.480
 misuse that's why we're going to determine 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.020
 now then we already know that the team 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.090
 of the liquid inlet then what 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.500
 we do is put it in the tool 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.300
 specific for this model 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 this is the specific for this is 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.210
 sad 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.210
 we put it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.920
 and now this is connected to all this 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.229
 instrumental that serves to measure the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.070
 pressure losses we go to the software 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.070
 that is installed on it 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.039
 then in this software what we do 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.229
 is to enter the email from the phone 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.420
 client in this case as is a test 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.800
 generic and what we do is choose the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.800
 model that I also have the option 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.880
 we choose the model and we start 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 and it simply tells me that this valve 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.140
 I have it open that theocracy 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.640
 the sky and we start with the measurement 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.129
 then with this first that we are 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.780
 doing is taking off air we are doing 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.670
 the void in the phone inside the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.680
 phone thinking we are taking out the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.480
 air to see and the instrumental what 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 is going to tell you through the software if 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.760
 have one that is the instrument is 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.060
 connected to a part within the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.980
 phone to get air and if the air 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.079
 Exactly each model has its entry in 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.430
 different zones but in this case 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.430
 so what I have to do with the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.659
 syringe is to draw air then here 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.480
 we see a yellow bar 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.830
 that goes down 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.830
 what we should get 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.329
 we give here 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.629
 begin t that moment we have it to 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.629
 no one 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.440
 Now this error is telling us that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.440
 the equipment is leaking 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.129
 then we put it 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.060
 in the blowing position to what we are 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.200
 doing to draw air is to inject air 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.200
 we beat the phone 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 in the special liquid 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.780
 you put air in it, you do not take out the phone and 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.780
 see if it has exact leaks 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.080
 first we see that the equipment is leaking 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.490
 and anna is a negative pressure and if 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.110
 the internal pressure grew is because he 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.520
 is entering air is so far what 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.520
 we do it is the inverse 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.840
 you get into the solution the story of 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.130
 our liquid solution and you put air 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 and then bubbles come out bubbles 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.410
 tell you why they are up to the form and 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.630
 then that indicates that the phone does not 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.880
 it is when it stagnated is covered 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.350
 for the guarantee and it would be repaired by being a 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.940
 cost transmit 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.729
 the normal repair is touching is a 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.610
 change finished directly 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:10.539
 and if it's watertight if it 's watertight it's the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.339
 case of this other team if the team 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.069
 stagnated then as we have not 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.599
 displayed any kind of abuse by 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.169
 part of the client is all perfect in 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.360
 The hit 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.059
 the covers also means that in 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.159
 some time has not been used by 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.809
 both the team a cap would not be 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.659
 put or the versions will be bubbles is 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.919
 that the definitive series of factories 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.599
 comes with some defect that is being 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.370
 escaping after he has received a 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.139
 blow I can not compare it is not the 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.539
 percentage that can be a cut that does not 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.189
 will leave a mark and I can not but 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.419
 if I do not know in bubble means that this one 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.460
 is so serious and that the mobile is fine 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.949
 only one has had to wet 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.520
 because one of the tricks of the 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.439
 user as it is called is the liquid that 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:56.889
 you told me that mentions this is called 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:58.149
 noveck 7000 7,390 7,300 is a liquid of 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.630
 high technology that does not affect the 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.670
 chronic circuitry 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.290
 I could put the laptop right now 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.480
 here 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.920
 and the software that uses it 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.140
 time the device because the software 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.520
 is the specific software that has sony 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.080
 mobile to do this kind of tests 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.949
 how deep and how long 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.139
 will endure are maximum 30 minutes and subway 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.639
 and a half if that time is exceeded as 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.580
 you know 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.810
 The only thing we know is if the team 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.090
 meets or does not complete that is the norm 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.740
 ip68 of the stations and one person 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.030
 improvement spends that time so that no longer 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.539
 because it is impossible to know here if not 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.879
 there is if the team is perfect and not 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.530
 it has leaks and it has powerful mosqueado 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.940
 because they have fulfilled something or you know a 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.860
 lid open or it has gotten deeper 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.960
 or has been more time 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.569
 we can not know the one we know that the 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.409
 team is fine but we do not know no 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.360
 we can say that it is impossible 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.590
 specify unless we see that 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.170
 comes 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.850
 just by the input of the usb is 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.590
 very marked red and the rest is in 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.780
 white may have entered but 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.820
 neither can anything more be assured than 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.780
 we know that the team is tight 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.780
 and that is vanity
