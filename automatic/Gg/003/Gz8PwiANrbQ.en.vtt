00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.320
 What is the other one in the same first hour 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:21.110
 How to use Lake Ashinoko finally 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.980
 In particular, I would like to study the bottom method of etching. 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:29.000
 I'm sorry 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:32.090
 First of all because edging is large from the side of the body to the distant body 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.850
 Use edging on the outside and a 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:41.859
 Approaching the side of the body from the distance of the body 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.820
 Please remember Fu say that serial to edging place to use this inside going close 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:49.629
 Talk to the outside and this is what you call aging 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.989
 Your strata Menger 6 edge firmly this on the outside 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.840
 So You're now use is pressed against that child 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.950
 To say the period edging on the inside side all of this ski 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.339
 Does the 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:10.789
 I will use this Meiji to play skis while sliding inwards. 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.600
 By doing so decide energized Why firmly direction of ยง turn of crime prevention on the slopes 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.060
 Lose 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 The wind is like skiing does not fall down with you and it slides in the direction you want to go 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:27.149
 You will be able to have a quality control turn 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.950
 Let's challenge such a movement Specifically what kind of movement do you want to make? 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:35.100
 First entered from now to turn and say 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:43.740
 The situation where you want to decide the direction of the exit of the turn 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:46.829
 As you are in the first half of the turn, it's like doing it outside the body from the middle of the body at that stage 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.840
 With the ski game machine 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.300
 It is Hejjigu Is will continue to press the ski on the outside this is that there is outside 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.490
 Next time 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:05.210
 Outside N mother at the time of the turn is likely to say Datte likely to end over soon ation 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:14.569
 This skiing on the outside of the body towards the inside 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:20.130
 Take a walk gradually from here to there while thinking about the distance with using or not a fixed point 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:26.130
 Because we use n etching while we are getting close to 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.940
 May be used as a replacement edging with plywood of this Ising turn 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 Or 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.960
 It actually 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 At first let's start from practice with big measurement of whole skin 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:45.060
 First of all , I will use the history of honor to the outside 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:49.130
 Gradually wrinkle so the other leg will cause the house is firmly slide in n edging 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.430
 Repeat this alternately left and right 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.430
 So we will be doing exercises on successive turns 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.739
 Defeat and the house respectively 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.810
 Because people who are supposed to lose their outside will turn around 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.800
 Now Now 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.800
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:22.800
 You can use it firmly inside 1 shifted to the outside foot 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.800
 Proper use and is good to use the legs of the inner leg room from the other little early Nee 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:49.349
 Oh wildebeest feet over master that is going to pan Eho Myoe 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.980
 High School in the second half of the Big different na wage of turn until the determined examples hand direction of Come has 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:57.489
 After being decided 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:02.019
 It is a stance that can speed up such movements that run and run beautifully. 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.290
 I'm not curling, but the earlier of the kerning turn Ueno 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.629
 Consciously saying something a Japan 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.629
 We will try to do in the practical speed 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.630
 It is very good as a style of this exercise 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:25.120
 Is that known by different outside and inside and their Sadako 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.120
 As a result upper body should be very stable- 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.320
 I wonder if not enough at Tteyuu edge a little to the outside before the turn 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.430
 eme 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.340
 The soil from the proposal stands 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.340
 This was the next move before the direction was decided 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.800
 It is good that the etching to the outside is very fast- 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.039
 And also support quickly to the inside 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.000
 It's a very good ski move What if this 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:04.160
 We can cope with set 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.960
 For that quick turn off gloss in the first hour of the lesson First in the direction of the body 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.620
 a 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:14.500
 Diarrhea in the reverse of the first half of the tur 's net twist and turn rice 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:18.630
 In the actual ski investigation using it while studying about it 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:23.660
 The middle to the outside of the etching etching and to the mouth of Edo 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:27.590
 And it found fused to take a good place to everyone mix 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:31.220
 Good clean and finally that such a flavor Hey very person 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.430
 Crisp short turn can now be free riding 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:40.760
 3 hours after this a 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:43.030
 It would be nice if I could do something that could be applied even in the gate for what was good in the first hour 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.030
 think 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:54.360
 The direction of edging in this technical lesson 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.360
 Then firmly move to spitting the upper body 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:04.090
 I will be able to continue the turn from one to the next while improving the completeness of Haan 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.600
 I was working on a place with a fin 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:14.220
 Meeting after the second hour 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:19.220
 Also about the contents after the art mix has been made , various items will be promoted in the new world as well 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.220
 I would like to go, so please thank you 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.020
 Ah ah ah
