00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.870
 short small review atv 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:13.849
 stealth 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.849
 2 600 y for port 6 hundred cubic engine 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:22.250
 thirty nine horses 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.250
 price in the store 210 thousand rubles 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 compact with a short base but 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.410
 double let's go you can ride 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:40.980
 beautiful wheels nominally completed 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:46.680
 winch winch with full-time 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.460
 electric control on the steering wheel electric 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.460
 winch control 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 looks very presentable beautiful 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 powerful rides almost everywhere 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.500
 I do not know a dirt until there is a piston and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.439
 climbed as it is practiced slopes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 slopes and other dirt off-road 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.250
 Well, of course no difference that is, externally 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 Here is such a well on my 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:30.920
 look handsome nice quadric what 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.409
 I would like to briefly say about 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.310
 disadvantages of this quad first 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.570
 major drawback here are the tubes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.290
 the exhaust manifold she's hot 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 red hot when i go here more 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.939
 fifteen twenty minutes on it she 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.070
 just bright red especially at night it 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.149
 visible and leg 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.079
 not that warm well at the limit of patience 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.750
 hot 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.409
 that is, the pipe is very hot by this 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.300
 need something to wrap some 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.430
 heat resistant material 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.930
 because well it is unrealistic on small 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.410
 speeds especially across the field 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.410
 just burns a leg even through clothes 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:29.570
 such a significant drawback to my 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:37.640
 a look what else of the shortcomings 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:41.780
 rear speed rear speed here 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.550
 CVT is worth switching 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.240
 the right passes is done using 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.270
 I don’t know this lever now 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.270
 maybe get demonstrate 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.280
 then he doesn’t know how he is 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.280
 base, yes, I only have a neutral 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.420
 unemployed and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.680
 it is not included 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.510
 hooked him on the lever to press and 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.049
 to hold 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.590
 give me speed 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.130
 Well, let's say it is not always successful sometimes 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.990
 good sometimes no problem by sometimes with 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:08.260
 problems I apologize for the rest 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.260
 such global flaws 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.600
 ATVs like there is no glove box but 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.510
 additionally installed kosher very 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.370
 I recommend to those who buy 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.260
 put extra light here in my 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.090
 In this case, well, it doesn't matter what 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.500
 I have in this case here such 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.750
 the light is very bright 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.270
 white road ahead 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.220
 regular light shines in principle tolerated 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.010
 but no more than tolerable that is light not 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.470
 especially good so you can 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.230
 rail lamp can be a great choice 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.130
 Now it is someone like that but 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.620
 the rest is basically nothing wrong 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.770
 say I can not go great on 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.650
 the road is magnificent off road in 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.740
 his element too great 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.430
 Here is such a short little surveyor 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.430
 thank you all
