00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
to standard axis axis so by turning this

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.950 
to standard axis axis so by turning this
off<00:00:09.889> here<00:00:10.889> what<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:11.969> doing<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.330> telling<00:00:12.660> it

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
off here what we're doing is telling it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
let me show you what's going to happen

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.610 
let me show you what's going to happen
here<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.940> click<00:00:42.210> insert<00:00:42.660> it's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
here is if you just click insert it's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
here is if you just click insert it's
going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> seem<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.969> bit<00:00:45.090> less

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
going to seem to be a little bit less

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.889 
going to seem to be a little bit less
predictable<00:00:46.850> but<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.180> attempting<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
predictable but what it's attempting to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
predictable but what it's attempting to
do<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.649> i<00:00:49.800> move<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.219> view<00:00:50.850> over

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
do you can see if i move the view over

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.709 
do you can see if i move the view over
so<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> center<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.329> grid<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so that the the center of the grid is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.799 
so that the the center of the grid is
over<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.469> hit<00:00:56.399> insert<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.660> it's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
over here and now hit insert what it's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.619 
over here and now hit insert what it's
attempting<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.890> generally<00:00:59.489> Center<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
attempting to do is generally Center the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
attempting to do is generally Center the
new<00:01:00.809> objects<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.980> about<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> middle<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
new objects at about the middle of the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
new objects at about the middle of the
screen<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.159> doing<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
screen so it's what it's doing is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320 
screen so it's what it's doing is
putting<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> relative<00:01:06.689> position<00:01:08.000> relative<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
putting a relative position relative to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.950 
putting a relative position relative to
the<00:01:09.630> current<00:01:09.900> view<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.510> inserting

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the current view you know it's inserting

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.760 
the current view you know it's inserting
the<00:01:13.049> object<00:01:13.470> based<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> relative<00:01:14.460> view

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
the object based on a relative view

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
the object based on a relative view
essentially<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:18.170> now<00:01:19.170> i<00:01:20.150> don't<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.420> like

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
essentially so now i don't really like

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.840 
essentially so now i don't really like
that<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.200> let<00:01:22.320> me<00:01:22.350> explain<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:23.070> other<00:01:23.280> aspect

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that but let me explain one other aspect

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.020 
that but let me explain one other aspect
of<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> i<00:01:25.560> should<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:26.850> are

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
of this and i should say that there are

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.539 
of this and i should say that there are
situations<00:01:27.540> where<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.950> helpful<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.430> mean

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
situations where that is helpful i mean

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
situations where that is helpful i mean
if<00:01:29.670> you've<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.270> large<00:01:30.630> scene<00:01:31.110> for

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
if you've got a very large scene for

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.219 
if you've got a very large scene for
instance<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.659> insert

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
instance and you want to insert

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.670 
instance and you want to insert
something<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.369> scene<00:01:36.409> at<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
something into your scene at a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.940 
something into your scene at a
particular<00:01:38.280> location<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.259> view<00:01:40.680> just

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
particular location that your view just

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
particular location that your view just
happens<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.549> around<00:01:41.970> inserting<00:01:42.659> an

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
happens to be around inserting an

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
happens to be around inserting an
instance<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.530> case<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> land

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
instance in that case is going to land

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
instance in that case is going to land
the<00:01:45.240> instance<00:01:45.689> right<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> middle<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.500> your

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the instance right in the middle of your

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.429 
the instance right in the middle of your
particular<00:01:47.310> view<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
particular view and that's going to be

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
particular view and that's going to be
really<00:01:49.680> nice<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> handy<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.060> able

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
really nice and handy for you to be able

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.450 
really nice and handy for you to be able
to<00:01:51.329> grab<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.680> know<00:01:52.799> move<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
to grab it and you know move it in that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.270 
to grab it and you know move it in that
relative<00:01:54.030> local<00:01:54.540> space<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.920> certainly

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
relative local space so there certainly

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.510 
relative local space so there certainly
are<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:57.119> things<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.259> behavior<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
are good things about this behavior this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.310 
are good things about this behavior this
new<00:01:59.729> behavior<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.360> 5.5<00:02:01.700> now<00:02:02.700> I'm<00:02:03.509> also<00:02:04.079> going

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
new behavior in 5.5 now I'm also going

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.170 
new behavior in 5.5 now I'm also going
to<00:02:04.409> show<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> another<00:02:05.009> aspect<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.880> watch

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
to show you another aspect of this watch

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.359 
to show you another aspect of this watch
what<00:02:06.420> happens<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.079> change<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.740> act<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.099> grid

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
what happens if I change the act of grid

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.270 
what happens if I change the act of grid
now<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.910> Z<00:02:09.149> active<00:02:09.569> grid<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.170> simply<00:02:11.069> come

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
now to the Z active grid and simply come

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.309 
now to the Z active grid and simply come
over<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.760> drag<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.270> in

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
over here and drag this in

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.440 
over here and drag this in
you're<00:02:13.499> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.709> notice<00:02:13.890> now<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.609> that<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.329> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you're going to notice now is that it is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.229 
you're going to notice now is that it is
automatically<00:02:16.260> orienting<00:02:17.749> the<00:02:18.749> y<00:02:19.019> axis<00:02:19.799> of

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
automatically orienting the y axis of

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.330 
automatically orienting the y axis of
our<00:02:21.620> instance<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:23.069> match<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.819> act<00:02:23.999> of<00:02:24.239> grid<00:02:25.340> so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
our instance to match the act of grid so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.910 
our instance to match the act of grid so
if<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.670> were<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.939> switch<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.659> my<00:02:27.959> ex<00:02:28.230> grid

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
if I were to switch this to my ex grid

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.940 
if I were to switch this to my ex grid
and<00:02:29.219> toss<00:02:29.939> this<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.299> here<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:31.590> see<00:02:31.799> what

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and toss this in here you can see what

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.709 
and toss this in here you can see what
it's<00:02:32.069> doing<00:02:32.159> is<00:02:32.639> it's<00:02:32.879> throwing<00:02:33.420> its

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
it's doing is it's throwing its

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.709 
it's doing is it's throwing its
reorienting<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:35.549> actually<00:02:36.060> orienting<00:02:36.569> for

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
reorienting or actually orienting for

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.539 
reorienting or actually orienting for
the<00:02:36.810> first<00:02:37.049> time<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.409> instance<00:02:37.950> based<00:02:38.219> on

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
the first time this instance based on

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.209 
the first time this instance based on
the<00:02:38.819> act<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.209> grid<00:02:40.129> okay<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.739> see<00:02:44.189> that

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
the act of grid okay so you can see that

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.860 
the act of grid okay so you can see that
that's<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.909> know<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.060> what's<00:02:45.450> happening

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that's you know that's what's happening

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.530 
that's you know that's what's happening
here<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.919> that<00:02:47.519> again<00:02:47.909> that's<00:02:48.150> good<00:02:48.419> if

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
here now that again that's good if

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.909 
here now that again that's good if
you're<00:02:48.659> really<00:02:48.810> cognizant<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.739> and

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
you're really cognizant of this and

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.229 
you're really cognizant of this and
you're<00:02:50.040> wanting<00:02:50.370> your<00:02:50.489> instance<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.090> be

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
you're wanting your instance to be

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.839 
you're wanting your instance to be
rotated<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.079> put<00:02:52.290> into<00:02:52.409> position<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.310> a

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
rotated and put into position in a

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.479 
rotated and put into position in a
particular<00:02:54.359> way<00:02:54.530> that's<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.709> good<00:02:55.889> thing<00:02:56.129> now

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
particular way that's a good thing now

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.789 
particular way that's a good thing now
you're<00:02:56.760> also<00:02:56.939> going<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.389> notice<00:02:57.689> that<00:02:58.560> by<00:02:58.739> D

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
you're also going to notice that by D

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.459 
you're also going to notice that by D
when<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.819> does<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:00.599> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> show<00:03:01.409> you

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
when it does this it's going to show you

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.399 
when it does this it's going to show you
that<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:02.340> instance<00:03:02.969> has<00:03:03.239> been<00:03:03.599> rotated<00:03:04.260> from

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
that this instance has been rotated from

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.770 
that this instance has been rotated from
its<00:03:04.620> default<00:03:05.040> position<00:03:06.199> okay<00:03:07.199> so<00:03:08.449> L<00:03:09.449> and<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
its default position okay so L and the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.599 
its default position okay so L and the
other<00:03:09.930> thing<00:03:10.019> too<00:03:10.439> is<00:03:10.469> it's<00:03:10.949> going<00:03:11.189> to<00:03:11.280> place

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
other thing too is it's going to place

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.539 
other thing too is it's going to place
the<00:03:11.939> center<00:03:12.269> point<00:03:12.480> right<00:03:13.409> on<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.159> active

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
the center point right on the active

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.469 
the center point right on the active
grid<00:03:14.879> at<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> very<00:03:15.359> bottom<00:03:15.599> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> instance

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:17.479 
grid at the very bottom of the instance

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:22.280 
grid at the very bottom of the instance
so<00:03:18.650> if<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:20.340> come<00:03:20.849> over<00:03:20.879> here<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.689> change<00:03:22.019> my

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so if I come over here to and change my

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.800 
so if I come over here to and change my
active<00:03:22.919> grid<00:03:23.129> to<00:03:23.250> why<00:03:23.400> again<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:24.060> throw<00:03:24.569> this

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
active grid to why again and throw this

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.499 
active grid to why again and throw this
here<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.400> see<00:03:26.609> in<00:03:26.699> this<00:03:26.819> case<00:03:27.150> it's

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:27.509 
here you can see in this case it's

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.219 
here you can see in this case it's
saying<00:03:27.930> okay<00:03:28.409> now<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.780> this<00:03:30.780> hasn't<00:03:31.199> been

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
saying okay now the the this hasn't been

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.520 
saying okay now the the this hasn't been
rotated<00:03:32.419> now<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.870> happens<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.379> be

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
rotated now and that happens to be

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.800 
rotated now and that happens to be
because<00:03:34.799> my<00:03:34.979> original<00:03:35.609> data<00:03:35.879> right<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.659> is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
because my original data right here is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.490 
because my original data right here is
set<00:03:37.259> up<00:03:37.439> just<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:37.919> this<00:03:38.280> okay<00:03:38.909> it's<00:03:39.659> the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
set up just like this okay it's the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.589 
set up just like this okay it's the
z-axis<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:41.220> coming<00:03:41.549> out<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.759> front<00:03:41.790> here<00:03:42.299> why

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
z-axis is coming out the front here why

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.979 
z-axis is coming out the front here why
coming<00:03:42.989> out<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.229> top<00:03:43.259> like<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:44.090> okay<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.150> now

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
coming out the top like that okay so now

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.869 
coming out the top like that okay so now
if<00:03:46.169> i<00:03:46.290> rotate<00:03:46.739> this<00:03:46.949> manually<00:03:49.340> down<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.609> that

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
if i rotate this manually down like that

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.990 
if i rotate this manually down like that
then<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:51.900> see<00:03:52.259> that<00:03:52.290> 90<00:03:52.799> degree

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
then you can see that 90 degree

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.939 
then you can see that 90 degree
orientation<00:03:54.000> which<00:03:54.659> is<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.259> same<00:03:55.470> as<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:55.799> i

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
orientation which is the same as if i

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:00.229 
orientation which is the same as if i
set<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:56.400> access<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.389> z<00:03:57.659> here<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:58.319> then<00:03:59.250> threw

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
set my access to z here and then threw

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.030 
set my access to z here and then threw
this<00:04:00.419> in<00:04:00.479> like<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.199> so<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.919> give

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
this in like that so it's going to give

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.209 
this in like that so it's going to give
us<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.310> same<00:04:02.579> rotation
