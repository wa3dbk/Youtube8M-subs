blackops rocked again this is one of my
favorite<00:00:20.939> Call<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.420> Duty's<00:00:21.900> although<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> be

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
favorite Call of Duty's although to be

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.810 
favorite Call of Duty's although to be
less<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.619> say<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.039> them<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.640> I've

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
less to say that about them all but I've

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
less to say that about them all but I've
got<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> little<00:00:24.180> bit<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> soft<00:00:24.689> spot<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:24.990> most

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
got a little bit of a soft spot for most

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.660 
got a little bit of a soft spot for most
of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> core<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> there's<00:00:26.550> always

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
of the core do is there's always

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.040 
of the core do is there's always
something<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.330> them<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.660> really

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
something about them that I really

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
something about them that I really
enjoyed<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.590> let's<00:00:29.130> look<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> top<00:00:29.760> 5

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
enjoyed so let's look at the top 5

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.030 
enjoyed so let's look at the top 5
reasons<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.810> think<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> gee<00:00:31.769> black

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
reasons that I think all of gee black

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.950 
reasons that I think all of gee black
ops<00:00:32.250> rocked

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.170 

at<00:00:39.710> number<00:00:40.040> five<00:00:40.220> I'm<00:00:40.370> gonna<00:00:40.460> go<00:00:40.670> for<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:40.970> fact

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
at number five I'm gonna go for the fact

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.820 
at number five I'm gonna go for the fact
that<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.450> sniping<00:00:41.930> for<00:00:42.170> me<00:00:42.290> was<00:00:42.470> quite

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
that the sniping for me was quite

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.980 
that the sniping for me was quite
balanced<00:00:43.340> now<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:43.670> appreciate<00:00:44.660> that<00:00:44.690> when<00:00:44.900> the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
balanced now I appreciate that when the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.020 
balanced now I appreciate that when the
game<00:00:45.140> first<00:00:45.200> came<00:00:45.650> out<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.340> sniping<00:00:46.820> was

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
game first came out the sniping was

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.390 
game first came out the sniping was
completely<00:00:47.540> broken<00:00:47.870> they<00:00:48.800> wanted<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.190> make<00:00:49.370> it

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
completely broken they wanted to make it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.610 
completely broken they wanted to make it
in<00:00:49.760> call<00:00:49.970> duty<00:00:50.000> black<00:00:50.300> ops<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.930> quickscoping

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
in call duty black ops so quickscoping

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.440 
in call duty black ops so quickscoping
was<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.830> lot<00:00:52.070> more<00:00:52.100> difficult<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:53.000> basically

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
was a lot more difficult and basically

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.119 
was a lot more difficult and basically
not<00:00:53.660> really<00:00:53.690> something<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.320> could<00:00:54.650> do<00:00:54.890> and

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
not really something you could do and

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.619 
not really something you could do and
when<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.520> game<00:00:55.730> first<00:00:55.760> came<00:00:56.059> out<00:00:56.360> when<00:00:56.540> you

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
when the game first came out when you

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.390 
when the game first came out when you
aim<00:00:56.870> down<00:00:56.900> sight<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:58.010> wouldn't<00:00:58.280> actually

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
aim down sight you wouldn't actually

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.979 
aim down sight you wouldn't actually
shoot<00:00:58.910> where<00:00:59.090> you<00:00:59.180> were<00:00:59.270> aiming<00:00:59.480> for<00:00:59.690> about

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
shoot where you were aiming for about

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.720 
shoot where you were aiming for about
the<00:01:00.200> first<00:01:00.379> second<00:01:00.980> now<00:01:01.100> for<00:01:01.280> me<00:01:01.400> that<00:01:01.580> was<00:01:01.670> a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
the first second now for me that was a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.549 
the first second now for me that was a
little<00:01:01.850> bit<00:01:02.000> overkill<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:02.960> they<00:01:03.080> did<00:01:03.320> have<00:01:03.530> a

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
little bit overkill but they did have a

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.800 
little bit overkill but they did have a
layer<00:01:03.830> on<00:01:04.100> patch<00:01:04.369> which<00:01:04.699> actually<00:01:05.089> changed

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
layer on patch which actually changed

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.330 
layer on patch which actually changed
this<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.200> made<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.500> bit<00:01:06.710> more<00:01:06.740> accurate<00:01:07.280> a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
this and made it a bit more accurate a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.250 
this and made it a bit more accurate a
bit<00:01:07.550> quicker<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:07.910> for<00:01:08.180> me<00:01:08.360> once<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:08.960> was

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
bit quicker and for me once that was

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.290 
bit quicker and for me once that was
done<00:01:09.560> after<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:10.040> few<00:01:10.310> months<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.760> is<00:01:11.149> how

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
done after a few months that is how

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.030 
done after a few months that is how
sniping<00:01:11.780> should<00:01:12.050> be<00:01:12.229> in<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.440> game<00:01:12.590> like<00:01:12.830> this

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
sniping should be in the game like this

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.650 
sniping should be in the game like this
or<00:01:13.220> maybe<00:01:13.399> not<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.700> should<00:01:13.940> be<00:01:14.119> but<00:01:14.509> for

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
or maybe not it should be but for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.210 
or maybe not it should be but for
someone<00:01:14.840> who<00:01:14.990> doesn't<00:01:15.229> enjoy<00:01:15.470> getting<00:01:15.800> quick

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
someone who doesn't enjoy getting quick

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.100 
someone who doesn't enjoy getting quick
scoped<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.880> isn't<00:01:17.090> really<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.330> quickscoper

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
scoped and it isn't really a quickscoper

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.990 
scoped and it isn't really a quickscoper
this<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.649> really<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> balancing<00:01:19.520> mechanic<00:01:19.970> that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
this is really a balancing mechanic that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.180 
this is really a balancing mechanic that
kind<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.450> works<00:01:20.720> for<00:01:20.960> me<00:01:21.110> now<00:01:21.740> if<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:21.890> want<00:01:22.130> a

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
kind of works for me now if you want a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.859 
kind of works for me now if you want a
quick<00:01:22.399> scope<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.970> do<00:01:23.420> all<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.600> kind<00:01:23.780> of

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
quick scope and do all that kind of

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.150 
quick scope and do all that kind of
stuff<00:01:23.990> there's<00:01:24.290> loads<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.560> cool<00:01:24.740> duties<00:01:25.009> for

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
stuff there's loads of cool duties for

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.070 
stuff there's loads of cool duties for
you<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:25.759> for<00:01:25.910> me<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.180> one<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.509> could<00:01:26.660> still

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
you but for me this one you could still

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.050 
you but for me this one you could still
snipe<00:01:27.440> still<00:01:27.890> have<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> good<00:01:28.340> time<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.759> it

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
snipe still have a good time and it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.030 
snipe still have a good time and it
wasn't<00:01:29.210> really<00:01:29.420> overpowered<00:01:30.350> or<00:01:30.530> frustrating

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
wasn't really overpowered or frustrating

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.770 
wasn't really overpowered or frustrating
to<00:01:31.130> play<00:01:31.340> against<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.119> come<00:01:32.300> up<00:01:32.390> against<00:01:32.660> a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
to play against if you come up against a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.510 
to play against if you come up against a
loggia<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.290> lobby<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.710> snipers<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.310> wasn't

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
loggia a lobby of snipers it wasn't

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.219 
loggia a lobby of snipers it wasn't
ridiculous<00:01:35.060> if<00:01:35.180> they<00:01:35.330> were<00:01:35.390> really<00:01:35.540> good<00:01:35.750> so

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
ridiculous if they were really good so

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.719 
ridiculous if they were really good so
for<00:01:36.380> me<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.500> really<00:01:36.619> enjoyed<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:37.640> for

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
for me I really enjoyed that so for

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.580 
for me I really enjoyed that so for
number<00:01:37.850> 5<00:01:38.180> I'm<00:01:38.509> gonna<00:01:38.750> say<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> swiping

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
number 5 I'm gonna say that the swiping

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.100 
number 5 I'm gonna say that the swiping
was<00:01:39.710> eventually<00:01:40.039> quite<00:01:40.610> balanced<00:01:47.110> number

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
was eventually quite balanced number

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.330 
was eventually quite balanced number
four<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:48.409> gonna<00:01:48.590> go<00:01:48.740> something<00:01:49.159> that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
four I'm gonna go something that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.190

different angles if something weird
happened<00:02:07.939> in<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.179> game<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.570> could<00:02:08.690> go<00:02:08.840> and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
happened in the game you could go and

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.270 
happened in the game you could go and
watch<00:02:09.049> it<00:02:09.229> back<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.649> figure<00:02:09.920> out<00:02:10.009> what

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
watch it back and figure out what

for number three I'm gonna go for the
fact<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.610> game<00:02:42.849> was<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.180> generally

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
fact that this game was just generally

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.990 
fact that this game was just generally
quite<00:02:44.080> balanced<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.340> grenades<00:02:45.700> weren't

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
quite balanced the grenades weren't

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.880 
quite balanced the grenades weren't
particularly<00:02:46.390> overpowered<00:02:47.230> there<00:02:47.650> was<00:02:47.739> no

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
particularly overpowered there was no

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.800 
particularly overpowered there was no
real<00:02:48.220> overpowered<00:02:48.879> weapons<00:02:49.330> apart<00:02:49.660> from

real overpowered weapons apart from

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
maybe the fam s is the one that I would

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.640 
maybe the fam s is the one that I would
say<00:02:51.730> needed<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.630> bit<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.840> tweaking<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.260> did<00:02:53.500> get

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
say needed a bit of tweaking it did get

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.740 
say needed a bit of tweaking it did get
a<00:02:53.680> Tweaker<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.220> waffles<00:02:54.670> were<00:02:54.760> strong<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.569> not

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
a Tweaker so waffles were strong but not

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.930 
a Tweaker so waffles were strong but not
ridiculously<00:02:56.560> strong<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.220> submachine<00:02:57.700> guns

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
ridiculously strong the submachine guns

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.180 
ridiculously strong the submachine guns
were<00:02:58.090> fun<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:58.599> not<00:02:58.959> over-the-top<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.560> mp5

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
were fun but not over-the-top the mp5

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.550 
were fun but not over-the-top the mp5
that<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.550> Kay<00:03:00.819> were<00:03:00.940> very<00:03:01.180> usable<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.410> they

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that a Kay were very usable but they

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.960 
that a Kay were very usable but they
weren't<00:03:02.769> particularly<00:03:03.160> overpowered<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:03.940> a

saying mp7 from modern warfare 3 and the
shotguns<00:03:09.069> were<00:03:09.280> useful<00:03:09.849> they<00:03:10.000> weren't

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
shotguns were useful they weren't

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.240 
shotguns were useful they weren't
terrible<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.140> kind<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.500> work<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:11.950> for<00:03:12.099> me

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
terrible and they kind of work so for me

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.130 
terrible and they kind of work so for me
this<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:12.610> quite<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:12.910> well-balanced<00:03:13.750> call<00:03:14.049> of

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
this was quite a well-balanced call of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.870 
this was quite a well-balanced call of
duty<00:03:14.410> while<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.769> most<00:03:15.010> balanced<00:03:15.430> core<00:03:15.640> duties

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
duty while the most balanced core duties

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.610 
duty while the most balanced core duties
we've<00:03:16.480> seen<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.019> think<00:03:17.170> tre<00:03:17.349> up<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
we've seen that I think tre up the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.930 
we've seen that I think tre up the
sights<00:03:17.860> get<00:03:18.069> really<00:03:18.280> good<00:03:18.400> at<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.670> also<00:03:18.849> I

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
sights get really good at that also I

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.789 
sights get really good at that also I
think<00:03:18.970> black<00:03:19.269> ops<00:03:19.450> 2<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.750> quite<00:03:20.110> balanced<00:03:20.440> but

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
think black ops 2 is quite balanced but

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.229 
think black ops 2 is quite balanced but
before<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.310> whenever<00:03:21.579> we<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.910> modern

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
before this whenever we have modern

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.910 
before this whenever we have modern
warfare<00:03:22.390> 2<00:03:22.599> which<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.349> a<00:03:23.380> bit<00:03:23.500> ridiculous

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
warfare 2 which is a bit ridiculous

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.880 
warfare 2 which is a bit ridiculous
world<00:03:24.519> at<00:03:24.640> war<00:03:24.880> with<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.299> MP<00:03:25.599> for<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.290> the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
world at war with the MP for a and the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.589 
world at war with the MP for a and the
balance<00:03:27.220> wasn't<00:03:27.700> quiet<00:03:27.970> where<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.299> was<00:03:28.390> there

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
balance wasn't quiet where it was there

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.330 
balance wasn't quiet where it was there
with<00:03:29.079> this<00:03:29.260> game<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:29.860> game<00:03:29.920> also<00:03:30.190> had

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
with this game and this game also had

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.309 
with this game and this game also had
quite<00:03:30.579> a<00:03:30.640> lot<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.819> variety<00:03:31.329> cod<00:03:31.599> 4<00:03:31.810> was<00:03:31.930> kind<00:03:32.200> of

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
quite a lot of variety cod 4 was kind of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.600 
quite a lot of variety cod 4 was kind of
balanced<00:03:32.620> but<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.799> didn't<00:03:33.040> have<00:03:33.130> as<00:03:33.220> much<00:03:33.340> for

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
balanced but it didn't have as much for

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.520 
balanced but it didn't have as much for
a<00:03:33.640> variety<00:03:33.819> as<00:03:34.209> black<00:03:34.780> ops<00:03:35.049> now<00:03:35.290> there<00:03:35.440> was

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
a variety as black ops now there was

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.900 
a variety as black ops now there was
some<00:03:35.680> annoying<00:03:35.920> things<00:03:36.250> about<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.610> balance

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
some annoying things about the balance

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.370 
some annoying things about the balance
of<00:03:37.060> course<00:03:37.299> they're<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.049> than<00:03:38.319> the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
of course they're going to than the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.960 
of course they're going to than the
things<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.709> sucked<00:03:38.950> about<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.370> game<00:03:39.549> but

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
things that sucked about this game but

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.490 
things that sucked about this game but
for<00:03:40.150> now<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.299> just<00:03:40.480> generally<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.230> whole

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
for now I just generally on the whole

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.720 
for now I just generally on the whole
thing<00:03:41.739> there<00:03:41.889> was<00:03:42.010> quite<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.190> balanced

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
thing there was quite a balanced

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.550 
thing there was quite a balanced
multiplayer<00:03:43.030> game

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.110 

at<00:03:50.560> number<00:03:50.920> two<00:03:51.099> I'm<00:03:51.340> gonna<00:03:51.519> go<00:03:51.640> for<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.909> fact

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
at number two I'm gonna go for the fact

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.119 
at number two I'm gonna go for the fact
that<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:52.420> introduced<00:03:52.959> wager<00:03:53.500> matches<00:03:53.920> and

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
that this introduced wager matches and

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.289 
that this introduced wager matches and
this<00:03:54.219> game<00:03:54.459> was<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.700> first<00:03:54.909> time<00:03:55.150> we've

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
suppose you could include the cod point

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.730 
suppose you could include the cod point
system<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.080> thought<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.320> cod<00:04:35.500> point

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
system in this I thought the cod point

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.100 
system in this I thought the cod point
system<00:04:36.099> wasn't<00:04:36.550> bad<00:04:36.880> at<00:04:37.060> all<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.690> still<00:04:37.930> had

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
system wasn't bad at all you still had

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.170 
system wasn't bad at all you still had
to<00:04:38.259> unlock<00:04:38.680> things<00:04:38.949> with<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.430> certain<00:04:40.120> amount

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
to unlock things with a certain amount

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.390 
to unlock things with a certain amount
you<00:04:40.599> can<00:04:40.690> just<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:40.990> anything<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.770> wanted<00:04:42.160> by

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
you can just have anything you wanted by

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.219 
you can just have anything you wanted by
the<00:04:42.460> fact<00:04:42.789> that<00:04:42.849> that<00:04:43.000> system<00:04:43.479> was<00:04:43.870> in<00:04:44.020> place

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
the fact that that system was in place

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.409 
the fact that that system was in place
kind<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.620> work<00:04:44.770> for<00:04:45.009> me<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.340> wage<00:04:45.849> match<00:04:46.150> just

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.450 
that you can spend hours on now was a
little<00:05:15.779> bit<00:05:15.930> reluctant<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.830> actually<00:05:16.979> choose

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
little bit reluctant to actually choose

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.339 
little bit reluctant to actually choose
this<00:05:17.699> because<00:05:17.939> obviously<00:05:18.240> quite<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:18.990> few<00:05:19.229> of

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
this because obviously quite a few of

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.499 
this because obviously quite a few of
these<00:05:19.469> are<00:05:19.649> dlc<00:05:20.189> maps<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:20.699> not<00:05:20.909> the<00:05:21.059> core<00:05:21.300> game

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
these are dlc maps so not the core game

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.510

and also I chose zombies for world at
war<00:05:23.729> but<00:05:23.969> world<00:05:24.240> at<00:05:24.360> war<00:05:24.539> was<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.020> zombies<00:05:25.409> that

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
memory of this or should I say the thing

that I remember the most I really love
playing<00:05:56.129> was<00:05:56.969> these<00:05:57.240> zombie<00:05:57.659> maps<00:05:57.930> now

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
playing was these zombie maps now

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.439 
playing was these zombie maps now
multiplayer<00:05:58.770> was<00:05:58.979> great<00:05:59.279> as<00:05:59.459> well<00:05:59.699> but<00:05:59.969> I

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
multiplayer was great as well but I

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.389 
multiplayer was great as well but I
think<00:06:00.689> this<00:06:00.869> is<00:06:00.990> a<00:06:01.020> bit<00:06:01.259> stand<00:06:01.649> out<00:06:01.889> more<00:06:02.099> stand

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:02.399 
think this is a bit stand out more stand

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.379 
think this is a bit stand out more stand
out<00:06:02.550> than<00:06:02.729> say<00:06:02.909> the<00:06:03.029> mighty<00:06:03.180> player

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
out than say the mighty player

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.820 
out than say the mighty player
multiplayer<00:06:03.539> was<00:06:03.899> great<00:06:04.139> and<00:06:04.289> balanced<00:06:04.649> like

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
multiplayer was great and balanced like

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.679 
multiplayer was great and balanced like
I<00:06:04.949> said<00:06:05.099> in<00:06:05.189> my<00:06:05.249> previous<00:06:05.490> numbers<00:06:05.969> but<00:06:06.360> for<00:06:06.419> me

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
I said in my previous numbers but for me

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.029
