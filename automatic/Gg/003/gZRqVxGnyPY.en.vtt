00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.719
 Hello my girls how are you welcome to 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.549
 this your channel again more today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.189
 I have them this super makeup 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.910
 simple but at the same time very attractive 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:19.970
 is a tuxedo in brown color he quoted 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.690
 I hope you like all of you 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.690
 I invite you to see it 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.919
 the first step to our makeup 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.290
 it will be to put an adhesive tape on 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.629
 angular form in the final part of 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.210
 our eyelid then we will pass a 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.100
 Shade fixer that is a skin tone 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.440
 we're going to spend it in the part 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.210
 superior and inferior then I'm going to 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.120
 use for this makeup this 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.000
 extensive costal palette of shadows and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.879
 blushes we are going to take a color that is 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.399
 brownie this is a little something 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.620
 candy is a shadow a little bit 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.500
 we will put it in the form of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.239
 arch across our entire basin then let's go 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.030
 to take a brochita a little more 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.030
 chubby and we are going to pass it to blur 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.450
 if you did not have in this girl palette 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.729
 can apply any other or if 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.860
 had a better then I'm going to 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.450
 use also from the same palette a 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.390
 Darker shade of brown 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.659
 this is also wise so I'm going to 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.759
 put on my entire mobile eyelid and then 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.950
 with this in a brochita let's play 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.259
 with the colors we are going to blur it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.080
 upwards so that he has a 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.080
 pretty degradation between both browns 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.240
 now I'm going to take this quartet is from 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.570
 coco magic let's take the color 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.330
 duraznito this is a bit satiny 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.090
 but it contains very bright glitter 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.180
 pretty so this time we're going to put it 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.369
 in the lower part of our eyebrows to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.369
 give light in that area 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.930
 to finish all this we went to retouch 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.990
 a little bit with our brush 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.570
 blur and as you can see 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.890
 girls is very simple now let's 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.990
 go on to delineate our eyes 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.970
 we're just going to do something very 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.060
 light to accompany our 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.280
 eyelashes so we've been doing a 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.640
 superfinite hairline and then simply 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.560
 we pulled him in the end part to 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.410
 make a classic outline 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.569
 we are going to remove the tape that was in the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 final part I'm going to touch up a bit with 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 corrector this area I'm going to apply 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.270
 false eyelashes 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.860
 this is optional girls if you 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 they simply want a mask 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.720
 I am applying this one that is de luxe and 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 then I'm going to give a little bit of 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.790
 dramatism just a little bit in the part 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.849
 of the water line and placing me one 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.800
 the pencil is the cappuccino nix and then 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.410
 I will also grow the area a little 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.230
 of the lower eyelid with a small 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.060
 brown and then with a more brown tone 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.799
 dark we use for the part 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.200
 superior very close to our 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.470
 tabs now I'm going to use this 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.819
 pearl pigment of vissum and so that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.280
 our makeup looks a little 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.830
 attractive let's do a little bit of 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.690
 light make a super thin hairline in the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.900
 part of the end as if it were a 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.360
 line 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.400
 now we reload a little bit our 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.879
 lower lashes with mask I'm 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.260
 using a maybelline for the 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.349
 lips first I will move to 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.590
 neutralize it with this very clear tone 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.340
 and then I will use this lipstick 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.099
 of jordan amat in is called tease and is a 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.269
 very beautiful coral so I'm going to pass it 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:53.409
 apply on top of that pencil that was 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.420
 more clarito to achieve this effect and 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.430

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.129

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.010
