00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello my name is maria l'ecal I 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.830
 am a scrapbooking animator for the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.570
 asa company and i will explain to you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.540
 today how to make a pretty 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.029
 gift in scrap or more simply a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.850
 album granted to make an album 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 accordion you need an album 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:31.980
 accordion twenty pictures one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.489
 scissors possibly a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.450
 pair of pliers is writing felts 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 and beveled jelly a pencil 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.090
 watercolor a template according to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.840
 the shape you want to use and a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.180
 gauge being in the accordion album he 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.550
 there are two sides the front and the back 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.980
 it is very important when you want 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.600
 make an accordion album to keep 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 a certain unity for the front of the same 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.150
 that for the back it would be quite 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.890
 inappropriate to mix shapes that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.369
 do not go together for example 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 rounds and hexagons on the same side 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.670
 another important point to realize 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 our accordion 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.909
 it's going to be defining a common thread 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.520
 for example a paper that we are going 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.450
 find on the different pages a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.060
 perfo that we will find scattered 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.610
 on the front and back or all 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100
 just a pencil line that we 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.689
 found on each page 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 this thread is all the more 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.070
 important that it will give the impression 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.880
 that it's a story that then follows 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.759
 in this album if I used a single 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.759
 and even template for both the front 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:02.020
 and for the back my lead 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.119
 being here for this autumnal album the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 small leaves cut to perfection 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:12.599
 here we find here released last the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.390
 entrance ticket and that we will find 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.450
 also on the back for this album ci which 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.730
 is a wedding album to offer in 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.400
 gift my director wire is going to be the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.750
 white metal paper that I will find 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.780
 practically on every page here and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.750
 then in the form of small flowers 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.069
 cut with two different sizes of 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.730
 perfo on this last little album you 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.519
 so have the hexagonal shape that I have 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.110
 used to which I added so a 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:59.130
 Deco relating to zoo animals of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.810
 animal pasta zebra stripes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.230
 made with a beveled felt 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.959
 tasks of the jirs made with chalk 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.370
 do not forget to decorate the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.880
 cover including a photo 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.420
 possibly a first name a date for 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.590
 a place and especially give them surrounded 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.380
 a very nice ribbon 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.030
 I can assure you that the surprise and 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.030
 the emotion will be at the rendezvous
