00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
communication and obviously if it's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.280

louder<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.420> yell<00:02:21.569> louder<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.140> get

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
louder you have to yell louder to get

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.670 
louder you have to yell louder to get
the<00:02:22.379> call<00:02:22.500> across<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:24.080> that's<00:02:25.080> that's<00:02:25.349> what

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680

communicate<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.709> think<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.730> of

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
communicate and and I think for all of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.619 
communicate and and I think for all of
us<00:02:29.879> online<00:02:30.060> don't<00:02:30.330> know<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
us online don't know what the

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.059 
us online don't know what the
quarterback<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.050> doing<00:02:31.379> quarterback<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.890> know

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
quarterback is doing quarterback to know

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.530 
quarterback is doing quarterback to know
when<00:02:32.280> running<00:02:32.489> backs<00:02:32.730> everybody<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.420> be

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
when running backs everybody just to be

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.960 
when running backs everybody just to be
on<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.660> same<00:02:33.870> page<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.290> important<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:34.970> it's

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
on the same page is important so it's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.230 
on the same page is important so it's
just<00:02:36.480> something<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.780> we're<00:02:36.959> stressing
