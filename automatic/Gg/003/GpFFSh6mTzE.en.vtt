00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
today I'll be looking at how to

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.040 
today I'll be looking at how to
successfully<00:00:15.770> install<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.130> remove<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:18.270> global

is the removal successful removal and
install<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.170> heatsink<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> fan

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
install of this heatsink and fan

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
install of this heatsink and fan
combination<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.070> few<00:00:35.309> people

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
combination I know that a few people

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.340 
combination I know that a few people
have<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.090> cracked<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:37.410> snapped<00:00:37.890> off<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
have actually cracked or snapped off the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.660 
have actually cracked or snapped off the
holders<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> slock<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
holders on the slock it on the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.299 
holders on the slock it on the
motherboard<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
motherboard so this is how I do it and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.459 
motherboard so this is how I do it and
maybe<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.730> help<00:00:45.020> some<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.289> there

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
maybe it will help some of you out there

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.580 
maybe it will help some of you out there
who<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:46.920> having<00:00:47.250> these<00:00:47.520> problems<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
who are having these problems or if you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
who are having these problems or if you
haven't<00:00:50.010> installed<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> these<00:00:51.030> heatsink

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
haven't installed one of these heatsink

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
haven't installed one of these heatsink
fan<00:00:51.690> combinations<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.949> maybe<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.879> will

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
fan combinations then maybe this will

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.720 
fan combinations then maybe this will
help<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.559> global<00:00:55.949> win<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.430> maybe

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
help you with the global win and maybe

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.990 
help you with the global win and maybe
even<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.329> other<00:00:57.600> heatsink<00:00:58.590> combinations<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
even with other heatsink combinations so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
even with other heatsink combinations so
let<00:01:00.210> me<00:01:00.239> swing<00:01:00.600> over<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.469> pc<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.430> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
let me swing over to the pc right now so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
let me swing over to the pc right now so
we<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> look<00:01:03.629> hang<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.260> second

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
we can have a look hang on one second

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.510 
we can have a look hang on one second
and<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> google

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and we'll be there this is the google

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750 
and we'll be there this is the google
win<00:01:12.180> heatsink<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.140> fan<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.340> actually

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
win heatsink and fan this is actually

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.580 
win heatsink and fan this is actually
the<00:01:15.229> fop<00:01:16.229> 32<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.130> global<00:01:17.580> win<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the fop 32 from global win and as you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.999 
the fop 32 from global win and as you
can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:20.570> here<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:25.009> locking

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
can see right here you have a locking

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
can see right here you have a locking
mechanism<00:01:26.390> which<00:01:27.390> snaps<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
mechanism which snaps into the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:38.240 
mechanism which snaps into the
motherboard<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:33.860> right<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.770> one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
motherboard and right here is the one

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
motherboard and right here is the one
which<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.060> control<00:01:39.479> over<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.110> actually

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
which you have control over to actually

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.569 
which you have control over to actually
push<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.790> once<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.509> down<00:01:42.780> far<00:01:43.140> enough<00:01:43.579> now

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
push in once it's down far enough now

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.749 
push in once it's down far enough now
the<00:01:44.640> trick<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.240> obviously<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.259> try<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.920> what

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the trick is obviously to try and what

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
the trick is obviously to try and what
you<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.030> first<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.689> hook<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.829> hook<00:01:50.009> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you do first is your hook you hook this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.160 
you do first is your hook you hook this
one<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.780> course<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:57.170> push

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
one first and then of course you push

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.459 
one first and then of course you push
down<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.280> until<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:01.170> far

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
down on this one until it's down far

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.219 
down on this one until it's down far
enough<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.270> flick<00:02:03.270> over<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> tab<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
enough so you can flick over the tab and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.660 
enough so you can flick over the tab and
make<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.619> hook<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.670> connect<00:02:06.450> properly<00:02:07.670> now

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
make it hook in and connect properly now

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.260 
make it hook in and connect properly now
as<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.119> see

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
as you can see

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.050 
as you can see
in<00:02:10.690> most<00:02:11.320> situations<00:02:11.590> you'll<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.670> will<00:02:12.940> be

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
in most situations you'll be it will be

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.320 
in most situations you'll be it will be
like<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.370> power<00:02:15.370> supply<00:02:15.640> will<00:02:15.970> be<00:02:16.090> very

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
like this the power supply will be very

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.820 
like this the power supply will be very
very<00:02:16.570> close<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.850> top<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.630> where<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.560> have

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
very close to the top of where you have

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.440 
very close to the top of where you have
to<00:02:21.270> push<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.300> down<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.160> latch<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.940> this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
to push it down and latch it on and this

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.530 
to push it down and latch it on and this
can<00:02:25.660> be<00:02:25.780> very<00:02:26.050> difficult<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.130> your

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
can be very difficult with just your

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260 
can be very difficult with just your
your<00:02:28.540> fingers<00:02:29.050> it's<00:02:29.740> very<00:02:30.160> hard<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.670> push<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
your fingers it's very hard to push it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.070 
your fingers it's very hard to push it
down<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.470> I've<00:02:32.650> used<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.880> case<00:02:34.150> this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
down so what I've used in this case this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.860 
down so what I've used in this case this
is<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:37.590> pair<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:39.630> tweezers<00:02:42.240> however<00:02:43.240> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
is a a pair of tweezers however you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.930 
is a a pair of tweezers however you
could<00:02:44.140> use<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.740> knife<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.250> plain<00:02:48.520> butter

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
could use a knife of just a plain butter

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.380 
could use a knife of just a plain butter
knife<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.600> do<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.730> actually<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.270> don't

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
knife to do this and actually I don't

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.450 
knife to do this and actually I don't
even<00:02:53.350> remove<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.990> fans<00:02:56.010> because<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.310> is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
even remove the fans because this is

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.160 
even remove the fans because this is
small<00:02:57.820> enough<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:58.420> fit<00:02:58.690> down<00:02:59.430> through<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
small enough to fit down through the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.060 
small enough to fit down through the
blades<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.890> fan<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.870> course<00:03:05.070> by

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
blades of the fan and then of course by

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.730 
blades of the fan and then of course by
doing<00:03:06.460> so<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.930> will<00:03:07.960> be<00:03:08.380> as<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.070> can<00:03:09.220> see

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
doing so you will be as you can see

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.310 
doing so you will be as you can see
pushing<00:03:11.740> down<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:15.340> far<00:03:16.180> enough<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.140> can

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
pushing down it far enough so you can

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.430 
pushing down it far enough so you can
actually<00:03:17.500> remove<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.130> now<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.780> notice<00:03:19.990> I'm

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
actually remove it now if you notice I'm

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.240 
actually remove it now if you notice I'm
actually<00:03:20.709> doing<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.400> with<00:03:22.240> one<00:03:22.480> hand<00:03:22.540> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
actually doing this with one hand and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.370 
actually doing this with one hand and
recording<00:03:24.250> with<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.610> other<00:03:24.760> hand<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.350> is

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
recording with the other hand so this is

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.520 
recording with the other hand so this is
extremely<00:03:27.190> easy<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.760> do<00:03:28.090> as<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:28.959> see<00:03:29.260> it's

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
extremely easy to do as you can see it's

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.180 
extremely easy to do as you can see it's
lifted<00:03:29.920> off<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:34.530> very<00:03:35.530> simple<00:03:35.860> from<00:03:36.040> that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
lifted off and very simple from that

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.820 
lifted off and very simple from that
point<00:03:36.370> on<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.820> it's<00:03:37.780> off<00:03:38.020> of<00:03:39.450> course<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:41.620> use

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
point on and it's off of course you use

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.870 
point on and it's off of course you use
the<00:03:42.040> same<00:03:42.280> trick<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.810> put<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.110> back<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:47.700> hook<00:03:48.700> in

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
the same trick to put it back on hook in

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.840 
the same trick to put it back on hook in
this<00:03:49.090> slide<00:03:49.330> first<00:03:52.590> then<00:03:53.590> once<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.040> heat<00:03:54.640> sink

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
this slide first then once the heat sink

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.900 
this slide first then once the heat sink
is<00:03:55.060> flat<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:56.830> course<00:03:57.130> proceed<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.640> push<00:03:57.880> down

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
is flat of course proceed to push down

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.530 
is flat of course proceed to push down
with<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.900> knife<00:03:59.110> or<00:03:59.970> whatever<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.360> to

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
with the knife or whatever you have to

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.000 
with the knife or whatever you have to
push<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.750> down<00:04:02.020> through<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:04.380> fan<00:04:05.380> or<00:04:05.680> even

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
push it down through the fan or even

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.620 
push it down through the fan or even
take<00:04:06.220> off<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.580> fan<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.940> course<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.360> push<00:04:07.480> it

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
take off the fan of course and push it

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.340 
take off the fan of course and push it
down<00:04:07.980> with<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.580> butter<00:04:09.790> knife<00:04:10.000> or<00:04:10.360> any<00:04:11.020> other

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
down with the butter knife or any other

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.780 
down with the butter knife or any other
device<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:12.010> feel<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.520> can<00:04:12.640> get

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
device that you feel like you can get

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.880 
device that you feel like you can get
down<00:04:12.970> through<00:04:13.209> there<00:04:13.420> push<00:04:14.200> far<00:04:14.410> enough<00:04:14.620> and

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
down through there push far enough and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.940 
down through there push far enough and
then<00:04:15.040> use<00:04:15.250> P

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.170 

I<00:04:19.270> can<00:04:20.270> see<00:04:20.510> here<00:04:20.810> use<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.920> little<00:04:24.850> adapter<00:04:25.850> I

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
I can see here use the little adapter I

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.660 
I can see here use the little adapter I
guess<00:04:26.390> on<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.690> side<00:04:27.230> but<00:04:27.980> just<00:04:28.160> hooking<00:04:28.400> in

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
guess on the side but just hooking in

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.430 
guess on the side but just hooking in
one<00:04:29.000> sits<00:04:29.210> down<00:04:29.390> for<00:04:29.450> I<00:04:29.690> let's<00:04:29.900> hook<00:04:30.020> hook<00:04:30.230> it

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
one sits down for I let's hook hook it

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.170 
one sits down for I let's hook hook it
in<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:34.340> want<00:04:34.670> to<00:04:34.880> do<00:04:35.000> this

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
in and you have it you want to do this

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.590 
in and you have it you want to do this
may<00:04:35.420> be<00:04:35.480> a<00:04:35.630> slow<00:04:36.140> push<00:04:37.130> down<00:04:37.400> pressure<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.060> you

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
may be a slow push down pressure and you

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.010 
may be a slow push down pressure and you
do<00:04:38.900> need<00:04:39.170> to<00:04:39.500> push<00:04:39.890> quite<00:04:40.460> heavily<00:04:40.700> on<00:04:41.120> this<00:04:41.840> to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
do need to push quite heavily on this to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.070 
do need to push quite heavily on this to
get<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.580> but<00:04:43.580> don't<00:04:43.850> push<00:04:44.060> too<00:04:44.090> hard<00:04:44.300> go

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
get it down but don't push too hard go

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.650 
get it down but don't push too hard go
down<00:04:45.320> just<00:04:45.590> far<00:04:45.890> enough<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.700> be<00:04:47.150> able<00:04:47.300> to

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
down just far enough to just be able to

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.220 
down just far enough to just be able to
latch<00:04:47.980> this<00:04:48.980> into<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.670> hook<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.120> once<00:04:50.960> it's

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
latch this into the hook and once it's

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.680 
latch this into the hook and once it's
hooked<00:04:51.410> in<00:04:51.650> that's<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.220> it's<00:04:52.430> it's<00:04:53.210> actually

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
hooked in that's it it's it's actually

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.890 
hooked in that's it it's it's actually
mounted<00:04:54.140> its<00:04:54.740> I'll<00:04:55.550> try<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.360> it's<00:04:56.690> kind

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
mounted its I'll try this but it's kind

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.070 
mounted its I'll try this but it's kind
of<00:04:56.990> difficult<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.590> do<00:04:58.430> this<00:04:58.870> with<00:05:00.730> one<00:05:01.730> hand

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of difficult to do this with one hand

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.250 
of difficult to do this with one hand
and<00:05:03.080> with<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.860> camera<00:05:04.250> on<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.460> other<00:05:04.610> hand

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
and with the camera on the other hand

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.600 
and with the camera on the other hand
but<00:05:06.260> let<00:05:06.410> me<00:05:06.440> try<00:05:08.890> just<00:05:09.890> make<00:05:10.130> sure<00:05:10.160> it's<00:05:10.400> lined

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
but let me try just make sure it's lined

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.590 
but let me try just make sure it's lined
up<00:05:15.790> okay<00:05:16.790> I'm<00:05:16.850> gonna<00:05:16.940> have<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.180> logs<00:05:17.360> in<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
up okay I'm gonna have the logs in the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.600 
up okay I'm gonna have the logs in the
camera<00:05:17.930> because<00:05:18.200> doing<00:05:19.100> this<00:05:19.250> pushing

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
camera because doing this pushing

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.340 
camera because doing this pushing
installing<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.480> picking<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.050> off<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.320> course

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
installing it picking it off of course

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.830 
installing it picking it off of course
is<00:05:21.650> easier<00:05:21.980> than<00:05:22.010> installing<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.750> taking<00:05:23.750> it

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
is easier than installing it taking it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.630 
is easier than installing it taking it
off<00:05:23.990> putting<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.800> putting<00:05:24.950> in<00:05:25.130> sorry<00:05:25.340> putting

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
off putting it putting in sorry putting

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.430 
off putting it putting in sorry putting
it<00:05:25.730> on<00:05:25.850> is<00:05:26.090> it's<00:05:26.540> much<00:05:26.690> more<00:05:26.840> difficult<00:05:26.900> and

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
it on is it's much more difficult and

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.740 
it on is it's much more difficult and
taking<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.920> off<00:05:28.070> because<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.180> pushing<00:05:29.570> down

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
taking it off because the pushing down

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.200 
taking it off because the pushing down
force<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.260> required<00:05:30.410> obviously<00:05:31.280> what<00:05:31.730> I<00:05:31.760> do<00:05:31.880> is

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
force is required obviously what I do is

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.840 
force is required obviously what I do is
I<00:05:32.300> first<00:05:32.570> start<00:05:32.780> with<00:05:32.840> my<00:05:33.080> left<00:05:33.320> hand<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:33.850> I

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
I first start with my left hand and I

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.020 
I first start with my left hand and I
actually<00:05:36.010> with<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.220> adapter<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:37.820> actually

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
actually with the adapter I actually

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.920 
actually with the adapter I actually
push<00:05:38.390> it<00:05:38.540> into<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:39.130> connector<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.250> words

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
push it into the connector in words

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.800 
push it into the connector in words
going<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.140> be<00:05:42.530> connected<00:05:43.010> to<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.370> adapter<00:05:44.180> so

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
going to be connected to the adapter so

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:54.220 
going to be connected to the adapter so
let<00:05:45.470> me<00:05:45.500> just<00:05:45.830> try<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.160> do<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.430> here<00:05:53.230> okay

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
let me just try and do this here okay

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.990 
let me just try and do this here okay
where<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.440> kind<00:05:54.650> of<00:05:54.800> strange<00:05:55.100> angle<00:05:55.610> here<00:05:55.820> but

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
where I kind of strange angle here but

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.620 
where I kind of strange angle here but
i'll<00:05:56.480> just<00:05:56.690> show<00:05:56.900> you<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:59.750> just<00:05:59.990> push<00:06:00.170> down

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
i'll just show you so just push down

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:12.840 
i'll just show you so just push down
heavily<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:05.240> once<00:06:06.140> it's<00:06:06.350> down

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.390 

make<00:06:13.850> sure<00:06:13.880> it's<00:06:14.120> lined<00:06:14.300> up<00:06:14.510> correctly<00:06:15.400> and

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
make sure it's lined up correctly and

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.720 
make sure it's lined up correctly and
there<00:06:16.520> you<00:06:16.639> go<00:06:16.670> it's<00:06:16.940> it's<00:06:17.270> installed<00:06:18.430> so<00:06:19.430> in

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
there you go it's it's installed so in

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.390 
there you go it's it's installed so in
the<00:06:19.820> matter<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:20.810> sheets<00:06:21.560> leggings<00:06:21.950> you

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
the matter of the sheets leggings you

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.510 
the matter of the sheets leggings you
have<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.760> on<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:23.270> off<00:06:24.130> successfully<00:06:25.130> by<00:06:25.340> not

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
have it on and off successfully by not

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.930 
have it on and off successfully by not
cracking<00:06:26.030> off<00:06:26.440> any<00:06:27.440> of<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.800> starts<00:06:28.220> which

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
cracking off any of the starts which

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.750 
cracking off any of the starts which
it's<00:06:29.150> attached<00:06:29.540> to
