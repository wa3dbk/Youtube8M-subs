before<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.130> games<00:03:47.310> overs<00:03:47.760> I'm<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.450> I'm

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
before the games overs I'm like I'm

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.050 
before the games overs I'm like I'm
trying<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.930> pour<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.320> on<00:03:49.440> them<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.830> like<00:03:50.790> I

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
trying to pour it on them and like I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.509 
trying to pour it on them and like I
want<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.420> embarrass<00:03:51.660> him<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.489> I

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
want to embarrass him so right here I

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.509 
want to embarrass him so right here I
think<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.380> he's<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.620> coverage<00:03:56.010> again<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.489> I

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
think I he's in that coverage again so I

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.400 
think I he's in that coverage again so I
just<00:03:56.730> thought<00:03:57.000> I'd<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:57.660> check<00:03:57.780> down<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
just thought I'd just check down to a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.060 
just thought I'd just check down to a
draw<00:03:58.920> like<00:03:59.400> why<00:03:59.610> not<00:03:59.820> he's<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.110> coverage

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
draw like why not he's in that coverage

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.620 
draw like why not he's in that coverage
so<00:04:02.280> I'm<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.459> gonna<00:04:02.610> do<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:03.000> every<00:04:03.209> time<00:04:03.239> if

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
so I'm just gonna do that every time if

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.979 
so I'm just gonna do that every time if
he's<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.080> coverage<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.970> then<00:04:06.780> right

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
he's in that coverage so and then right

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.530 
he's in that coverage so and then right
here<00:04:07.100> I'm<00:04:08.100> wanting<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.580> do<00:04:08.850> something<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.390> think

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
here I'm wanting to do something I think

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.530 
here I'm wanting to do something I think
I<00:04:09.570> want<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.840> throw<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.080> dez<00:04:10.320> bryant<00:04:10.769> maybe<00:04:11.540> but
