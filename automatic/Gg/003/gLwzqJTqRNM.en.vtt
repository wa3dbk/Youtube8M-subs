00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello i'm arian again and i do 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 today an unboxing and a review on the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 dvd lego star wars the empire beats 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.639
 ins them is still complete 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.240
 welded in I do not have it yet 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.150
 opened 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 You can already see here 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 we can do a mini figure as well 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.029
 read exclusive lego minifigures allowed 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.590
 neither with orden so that comes too 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 During the film I find cool 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 I think cool as a side dish in the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.109
 last dvd the paravan threats were 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.090
 namely only with the blu ray edition 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.420
 a mini figure is already at 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.480
 the dvd version I like 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 the film costs 999 for that one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.320
 Dvd with figure is when I the one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.090
 reasonable price would be only now 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 the film I think the price a bit too 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.289
 high on the back we still find 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 a summary of the movie couple 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 pictures and of course the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.989
 Information the term is 21 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.699
 minutes spoke german and english 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.410
 subtitles German and English for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.570
 hearing impaired and of course that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.039
 recorded format and I would say 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.039
 Let's unpack them together 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.679
 let's put the foil on the side like that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.130
 We would have a look 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.600
 continue 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.549
 here we want the dvd out so 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.310
 just on the dvd are always the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.179
 same as on the packaging and the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.179
 look what but right now 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.909
 Here we can open it like this 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:12.870
 then could I believe the figure to 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:15.690
 take out again so then Hiermann then 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:21.209
 the coal darth vader figurine high value 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:24.650
 still glued to this good falls from there 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.650
 At least not right away 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.320
 that looks pretty cool i like it 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.950
 In any case beautiful with medal everything 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.840
 detail true to the helmet also looks quite 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.310
 cool, I do not have any 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.910
 Everyone is allowed to wear the coat as well 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.910
 very cool to 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.890
 was seen here 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.760
 some strictly strich may neither of 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.170
 faces also looks really awesome 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.830
 a little scratch law very much 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.210
 I find shared faithfulness to everyone 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.200
 It's good that they did something like that 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.240
 have that in the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.640
 dvd version that have inserted because I 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.720
 buy myself really only because then dvds 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.370
 i can also do that later for example 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.410
 on my iphone or on my ipad on it 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.750
 because I do not have any 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.960
 Blu-ray drive so yes I think that 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.160
 figure it out looks very much from 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:41.640
 we put the second page already something 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:45.960
 now the dvd will suspect that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.950
 here is always left an infoblatt too 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.140
 the new sets a new mini figures 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.670
 which since February are still here 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.800
 below right information to the new 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.880
 animation series or chronicles how to 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.090
 on lego dot com I like that 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.860
 look what we have here 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:12.230
 I still get multitasking clones 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.090
 I also have the headhunter twice 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.120
 there is also a review and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.440
 of course, then the dvd purchase version 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.840
 no lending me that we do now 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.170
 apparently very big and yes that is 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.170
 then everything 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.480
 Let's come to my conclusion so the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.090
 I liked the movie a lot 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.250
 good story beautiful funny scenes and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.900
 then to the dvd a mini figure 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.230
 so for me that definitely one 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.390
 worth buying and for 999 it's alright 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.040
 Any of the liver stars I should like to 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.550
 to beat every case and thank you very much 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.550
 for watching
