00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.519
 fundamental applications for a dj 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.800
 good noteworthy that these 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.260
 applications are totally free and it 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.740
 You can find both in the app store 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.900
 as in the play store the applications 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.380
 they include purchases within the app 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.900
 so do not be surprised well we're going to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.740
 see decapitations we are talking 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.080
 the first application is launch keys 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.220
 made by novation and this application was 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.230
 created for users who enjoy 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:51.180
 songs with electronic piano and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.590
 effects the second is launchpad created 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 by novation well this is launchpad 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.940
 includes several topics so much is break room 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.159
 and bass 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.890
 you and pop house show 2 off the whole 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.610
 grains yg 2 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.979
 well here in store you can buy 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 packs but they are only backups we are going to 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.229
 see what is being the keyboard this 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.640
 the keyboard is coming, the arrows are 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.380
 short sounds and circles what 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.280
 they have circles in between they are sounds 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.960
 permanent 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.860
 here in this application you can change 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.409
 both the volume so that one sounds more 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.150
 that the other we know that anyone 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.729
 you can also change the lesson the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.149
 club is very different from the volume because 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.080
 this is going to make it not sound or sound or 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.240
 if it distorts into sound and it also 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.170
 You can put the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.990
 what is effects 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.470
 as much as distortion up to 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.390
 repetition repeats from 1 to 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.940
 1 sixteenths 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.459
 launch key is a little more application 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.140
 simple since it's just a piano this 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.720
 Application is recommended for users 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.459
 that have electronic pianos since they 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.580
 has seen several videos on youtube where 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.470
 the pianos are connected to the ipad by 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.680
 medium of an adapter and the application 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.080
 pianos makes magic with this 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.010
 application is very complex very funny 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.410
 and it helps a lot unfortunately no 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.870
 these applications contains what is 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.170
 record the audio or record the audio of 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.550
 what you are creating as far as 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.250
 Sometimes it 's a bit inconvenient to create light 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.020
 creations and you can not record them in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.060
 some place can be recorded in 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.670
 computer but these are already others 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.590
 very different programs and that maybe 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.140
 cost a bit, it may fall 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.780
 free but they will not work the same 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.880
 that one of good pay this has been all 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.040
 in today's episode I hope they have 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.140
 liked these two applications and 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.370
 remember that you can find it in app 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.930
 store or in play store good I say goodbye and 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:21.240
