guys DJ eyes here and if you guys are
attempting<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.650> get<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.950> MOA<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.420> Moab

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
attempting to get this MOA be the Moab

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.680 
attempting to get this MOA be the Moab
mother<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.740> all<00:00:13.860> bombs<00:00:14.420> kill<00:00:15.420> streak

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
mother of all bombs kill streak

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.779 
mother of all bombs kill streak
basically<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.010> 25<00:00:17.340> kills<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
basically you have to get 25 kills in a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.590 
basically you have to get 25 kills in a
row<00:00:17.820> gun<00:00:18.240> only<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.010> that<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.609> pretty<00:00:21.210> much<00:00:21.330> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
row gun only and that is pretty much it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.779 
row gun only and that is pretty much it
so<00:00:22.230> I'm<00:00:22.590> showing<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.430> tutorial

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so I'm showing you this little tutorial

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.439 
so I'm showing you this little tutorial
though<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> hopefully<00:00:25.050> help<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:26.210> go<00:00:27.210> about

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
though to hopefully help you go about

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.550 
though to hopefully help you go about
this<00:00:27.660> now<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:28.019> going<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> notice<00:00:28.349> right

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this now you're going to notice right

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
this now you're going to notice right
here<00:00:28.619> i<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.340> five<00:00:29.970> point<00:00:30.330> kill<00:00:30.570> streak

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
here i just got five point kill streak

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.590 
here i just got five point kill streak
and<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.109> i<00:00:31.769> called<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> counter<00:00:32.579> UAV<00:00:32.700> now

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and the i called in a counter UAV now

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.310 
and the i called in a counter UAV now
you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.290> use<00:00:34.590> UAV<00:00:35.309> counter<00:00:35.700> UAV<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.320> advanced

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you can use UAV counter UAV and advanced

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.790 
you can use UAV counter UAV and advanced
UAV<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.629> still<00:00:39.930> end<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.410> getting

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
UAV and and you can still end up getting

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.959 
UAV and and you can still end up getting
the<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> mother<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.739> bombs<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.280> point

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the the mother of all bombs so point

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
the the mother of all bombs so point
point<00:00:45.270> being<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.320> best

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
point being I think these are the best

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
point being I think these are the best
three<00:00:47.149> kill<00:00:48.149> streaks<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.809> run<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
three kill streaks that you can run that

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.799 
three kill streaks that you can run that
can<00:00:49.350> help<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.100> stack<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.969> after

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
can help you they also stack so after

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
can help you they also stack so after
you<00:00:51.960> hit<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.680> kill<00:00:52.860> streak<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> go

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you hit the kill streak and you go

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.930 
you hit the kill streak and you go
through<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> uh<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> 12<00:00:56.850> or

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
through and you get it uh the the 12 or

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
through and you get it uh the the 12 or
13<00:00:57.210> kills<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.510> whatever<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
13 kills or whatever it is and and it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.240 
13 kills or whatever it is and and it
gives<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.600> advance<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> UAV<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:02.100> can

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
gives you that advance you a UAV you can

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.910 
gives you that advance you a UAV you can
go<00:01:02.370> ahead<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> start<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:04.739> next

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
go ahead and start it is then very next

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
go ahead and start it is then very next
kill<00:01:05.159> will<00:01:05.369> go<00:01:05.549> towards<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.090> UAV<00:01:06.990> again<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
kill will go towards a UAV again and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.920 
kill will go towards a UAV again and
then<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> counter<00:01:08.549> UAV<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
then the counter UAV and so on so just

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.859 
then the counter UAV and so on so just
keep<00:01:10.229> cycling<00:01:10.680> through<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> killstreaks

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
keep cycling through the killstreaks

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
keep cycling through the killstreaks
which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> great<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> mean<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.710> means<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
which is great I mean that means you can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
which is great I mean that means you can
get<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> UAVs<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> UAVs<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
get to UAVs to can I UAVs and to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
get to UAVs to can I UAVs and to
advanced<00:01:17.700> UAVs<00:01:18.090> before<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.020> get

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
advanced UAVs before you actually get

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
advanced UAVs before you actually get
the<00:01:19.350> mother<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.189> bombs<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.090> it's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the mother of all bombs now I know it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
the mother of all bombs now I know it's
going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.509> very<00:01:21.540> tough<00:01:22.259> task<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.159> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
going to be very tough task to get this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.350 
going to be very tough task to get this
because<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.560> fast<00:01:26.310> paced<00:01:26.610> game<00:01:26.820> like

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
because it's really fast paced game like

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
because it's really fast paced game like
it's<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> hard<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.710> 25<00:01:29.070> kills

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's going to be hard to get 25 kills

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's going to be hard to get 25 kills
gun<00:01:29.640> only<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.720> guys<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:31.020> ever<00:01:31.049> going

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
gun only but if you guys are ever going

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.510 
gun only but if you guys are ever going
to<00:01:31.380> attempt<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> way<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to attempt this this is the way to do it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
to attempt this this is the way to do it
though<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> said<00:01:33.180> UAB<00:01:33.570> counter<00:01:34.170> UAV<00:01:34.320> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
though like I said UAB counter UAV in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
though like I said UAB counter UAV in
advanced<00:01:35.189> UAV<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.420> showing<00:01:36.540> you

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
advanced UAV and I'm just showing you

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.819 
advanced UAV and I'm just showing you
right<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> ended<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.619> getting<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
right there that I ended up getting the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.140 
right there that I ended up getting the
25-point<00:01:40.829> kill<00:01:41.070> streak<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> see<00:01:42.060> on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
25-point kill streak and you can see on

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
25-point kill streak and you can see on
the<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.420> hand<00:01:42.720> side<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.500> filled<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> bomb

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the right hand side it filled the bomb

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.800 
the right hand side it filled the bomb
filled<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.950> previously<00:01:46.950> empty

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
filled up the the the previously empty
