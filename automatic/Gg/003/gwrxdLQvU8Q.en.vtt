00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.580
 new breakfast new week 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 start and continue with the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.310
 boosters of the series I had started to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.930
 reopen last week I do not know 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.400
 not if you remember if you do not know 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.080
 not go see the two previous ones at 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.490
 the less you will be in the continuity of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 this opening of four booster 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 crossed border 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 and here we start the third one 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.059
 booster which is pretty good and I have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.309
 purposely keep it for Monday because 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.530
 I love this illustration also that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.129
 from black qmm look at me how much 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.940
 I love the colors and his posture is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.400
 really impressive it is very very 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 pleasure to see and in any case I hope 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.799
 that he's going to go up the level is 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.540
 normally in a new week 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.129
 so it should be okay 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.049
 I hope it will start on 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.540
 hats of the wheel I cross my fingers and 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.580
 we'll go then that's the back of the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.170
 boost people to dream the mighty 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.239
 to regroup and border crossed 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 I do not think it's going too much 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.540
 together but it does not matter 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.330
 good and I go to the opening of this 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.070
 small boost I would like a little 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.150
 ultra anyway I would like a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.229
 small ultra because border 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 crossed a series that I had 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.430
 completed in the past I had been well 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.080
 spoiled with it and it's been a long time 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.760
 I can ultra in the breakfast 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 so a little ultra today is getting 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.150
 would do good even though I know we 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.760
 will not have an ultra I hope when 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.450
 even we have to hope in the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.000
 life must hope 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.370
 so we start with a pokemon that I 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.690
 do not like at all it's about wisk 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.180

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.020

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.609
 pokÃ©mon continuously with a greenhouse ray 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.740
 our borders crossed that one I 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.110
 know when I see her I know everything about 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.430
 Following it belongs border crossed 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.870
 typical succar of the series that comes back 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.170
 very often if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.720
 we will link with a ortiz then that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.140
 I did not know her 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.900
 pleasure 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.150
 a rather special illustration design 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.220
 and an effect on the level part of 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.620
 petals if I can call it like that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.120
 they are really not bad normally I 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.769
 I'm not a fan of this type of illustration 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 there but that must make it really 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.290
 very very good with very beautiful corded 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.790
 map 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.150
 arrive 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.680
 the search for energy in rivers has the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.260
 parties to look for water energy 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.910
 today, well, I love it 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.530
 typographic thematic favorite with the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.209
 fire type normally I always said 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.310
 in the past I was more fire than oh 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.720
 but finally I still ask myself 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.970
 question will I not be at 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.349

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.519

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.980

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.040

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.519

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.060
 which I have a big favorite but 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.440
 it's okay, but right now 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.690
 often happens there I find 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.000
 I really have no chance of everything in 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.620

 a good pick in these boosters 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.010
