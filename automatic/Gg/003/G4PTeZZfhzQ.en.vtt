as we navigate this world it is all just
a<00:02:24.650> fantasy<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.989> yet<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.319> seems<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:27.890> real<00:02:28.220> as

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
a fantasy and yet it seems as real as

a fantasy and yet it seems as real as
the<00:02:29.120> news<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> screen<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.920> sound<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> this

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the news on a screen of a sound of this

table the people we love
and<00:02:33.990> that's<00:02:34.380> why<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> think<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.220> very

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and that's why I think it's very

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
and that's why I think it's very
important<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.240> deal<00:02:36.690> with<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.320> definition

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
important to deal with this definition

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.880 
important to deal with this definition
of<00:02:38.010> fantasy

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.190

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
yes I don't know you don't grant but I

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.110 
yes I don't know you don't grant but I
think<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> world<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.670> big<00:02:45.849> enough<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
think that the world is big enough to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.319 
think that the world is big enough to
accommodate<00:02:46.300> both<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.200> us
