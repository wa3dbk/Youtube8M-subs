to mess around with some new kind of mob

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.190 
to mess around with some new kind of mob
system<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:05.670> right<00:00:05.910> now<00:00:05.940> i'm<00:00:06.150> using<00:00:06.200> dawkins

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
system so right now i'm using dawkins

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.640 
system so right now i'm using dawkins
super<00:00:07.919> flat<00:00:08.160> world<00:00:08.700> because<00:00:09.240> has<00:00:10.019> half<00:00:10.290> slabs

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
super flat world because has half slabs

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.400 
super flat world because has half slabs
so<00:00:11.370> which<00:00:11.910> works<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:12.450> well<00:00:12.630> spawning<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
so which works really well spawning and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.320 
so which works really well spawning and
my<00:00:16.410> idea<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.490> little<00:00:17.730> different<00:00:18.090> than<00:00:18.210> other

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
my idea is a little different than other

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.730 
my idea is a little different than other
ones<00:00:18.510> I've<00:00:18.630> seen<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.199> I've<00:00:19.500> seen

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
ones I've seen I don't think I've seen

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.500 
ones I've seen I don't think I've seen
something<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.160> before<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.910> lot<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
something like this before a lot of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
something like this before a lot of
people<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> use<00:00:22.140> pistons<00:00:22.939> for<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
people like to use pistons for the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.990 
people like to use pistons for the
mobster<00:00:24.539> walk<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.990> our<00:00:25.609> spawn<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> pressure

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
mobster walk on our spawn on pressure

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400 
mobster walk on our spawn on pressure
plates<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.359> something<00:00:27.630> push<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.990> off<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
plates or something push them off and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
plates or something push them off and
make<00:00:28.560> them<00:00:28.680> follow<00:00:29.010> death<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.779> decided<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> try

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
make them follow death I decided to try

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.240 
make them follow death I decided to try
something<00:00:31.230> new<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.769> use<00:00:32.210> snowmen<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.100> have

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
something new and use snowmen so I have

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.360 
something new and use snowmen so I have
a<00:00:35.280> few<00:00:35.520> different<00:00:35.579> types<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:37.190> this<00:00:38.190> one

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
a few different types here this one

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.069 
a few different types here this one
seems<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.760> working<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.210> best<00:00:39.510> right<00:00:39.930> now

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
seems to be working the best right now

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.880 
seems to be working the best right now
it's<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.100> level<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.860> level<00:00:43.860> with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it's just there at level or I level with

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.470 
it's just there at level or I level with
the<00:00:44.160> moms<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.149> they'd<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
the moms where they'd be at and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.840 
the moms where they'd be at and
separated<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:51.449> glass<00:00:51.690> panels<00:00:52.230> pains<00:00:52.850> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
separated by the glass panels pains to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.569 
separated by the glass panels pains to
keep<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.660> their<00:00:54.780> spots<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:56.460> right

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
keep them in their spots so all right

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
keep them in their spots so all right
I'm<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.480> peaceful<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.109> change

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
I'm right now I'm on peaceful I change

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.180 
I'm right now I'm on peaceful I change
it<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:58.949> hard<00:00:59.840> say<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> zombie<00:01:01.590> spawns<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.980> there

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it on hard say a zombie spawns in there

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.399 
it on hard say a zombie spawns in there
they'll<00:01:03.180> shoot<00:01:03.329> him<00:01:03.480> he<00:01:03.809> falls<00:01:04.110> he<00:01:04.650> dies<00:01:05.299> so

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
they'll shoot him he falls he dies so

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.270 
they'll shoot him he falls he dies so
depending<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.770> they'll<00:01:08.159> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
depending on where they are they'll just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.969 
depending on where they are they'll just
get<00:01:08.400> shot<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.560> sometimes<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> little

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
get shot and sometimes take a little

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.580 
get shot and sometimes take a little
longer<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.580> guy<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.290> they'll<00:01:13.439> end

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
longer like this guy but if they'll end

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
longer like this guy but if they'll end
up<00:01:13.650> falling<00:01:14.509> or<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.810> cases<00:01:15.869> they'll<00:01:16.439> just

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
up falling or in some cases they'll just

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.219 
up falling or in some cases they'll just
get<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> grid<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.790> walk<00:01:17.939> off<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.990> side

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
get a grid and walk off this side

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.249 
get a grid and walk off this side
instead<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:20.009> they're<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> most

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
instead if they're on here it's the most

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.780 
instead if they're on here it's the most
part<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.590> work<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.580> problem

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
part it will work so but one problem

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.070 
part it will work so but one problem
I've<00:01:26.939> had<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830 

skeletons<00:01:31.280> like<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.520> shoot<00:01:32.730> back<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.720> they

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
skeletons like to shoot back when they

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
skeletons like to shoot back when they
get<00:01:33.990> shot<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.610> saw<00:01:35.790> right<00:01:35.940> there

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
get shot and like you saw right there

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.350 
get shot and like you saw right there
that<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.780> died<00:01:37.110> been<00:01:38.070> trying<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.670> work

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that one just died been trying to work

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.080 
that one just died been trying to work
with<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.550> see<00:01:41.550> if<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.820> come<00:01:41.940> up<00:01:42.000> with

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
with that and see if I can come up with

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.150 
with that and see if I can come up with
other<00:01:42.300> ways<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:43.230> prevent<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:43.890> being

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
other ways to prevent them from being

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.610 
other ways to prevent them from being
shot<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> keep

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
shot so that way you don't have to keep

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.180 
shot so that way you don't have to keep
putting<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> new<00:01:47.340> snowman<00:01:48.240> every<00:01:48.480> so<00:01:48.660> often<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
putting a new snowman every so often I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.310 
putting a new snowman every so often I
tried<00:01:50.190> putting<00:01:50.430> half<00:01:50.910> slabs<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.690> but<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
tried putting half slabs here but that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.720 
tried putting half slabs here but that
just<00:01:52.520> makes<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.820> Snowman<00:01:54.240> less<00:01:54.480> accurate<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
just makes the Snowman less accurate and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.980 
just makes the Snowman less accurate and
they<00:01:56.730> still<00:01:56.970> get<00:01:57.090> shot<00:01:57.330> every<00:01:57.480> now<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> then

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
they still get shot every now and then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.520 
they still get shot every now and then
you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.010 

and<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:04.090> can<00:02:04.240> have<00:02:04.390> different<00:02:04.659> arrangements

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
and you can have different arrangements

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.149 
and you can have different arrangements
for<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.170> floors<00:02:05.409> as<00:02:05.590> long<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.860> there<00:02:05.979> are<00:02:06.040> some

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
for the floors as long as there are some

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.109 
for the floors as long as there are some
spaces<00:02:06.700> for<00:02:07.630> them<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.900> fall<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.850> like<00:02:09.850> if<00:02:10.030> you

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
spaces for them to fall in like if you

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.309 
spaces for them to fall in like if you
want<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.330> do<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> checkerboard<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.170> could

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
want to do a checkerboard it could

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.230 
want to do a checkerboard it could
probably<00:02:11.470> work<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:12.970> because<00:02:13.150> it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
probably work I just use this because it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.180 
probably work I just use this because it
was<00:02:13.330> pretty<00:02:13.450> easy<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.260> they<00:02:14.980> don't<00:02:15.100> know

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
was pretty easy to do they don't know

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.170 
was pretty easy to do they don't know
what<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.580> most<00:02:15.730> efficient<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:19.060> like

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
what be the most efficient see like

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.610 
what be the most efficient see like
right<00:02:19.330> here<00:02:19.630> they're<00:02:20.050> having<00:02:20.319> trouble

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
right here they're having trouble

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.680 
right here they're having trouble
shooting<00:02:20.890> each<00:02:21.040> other<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.430> stuff<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.600> that's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
shooting each other and stuff so that's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.470 
shooting each other and stuff so that's
why<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.280> half<00:02:24.280> slept<00:02:24.580> aren't<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.850> best<00:02:25.090> idea

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
why the half slept aren't the best idea

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.710 
why the half slept aren't the best idea
but<00:02:26.319> if<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:26.800> some<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.069> these<00:02:27.160> out<00:02:27.600> see<00:02:28.600> it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
but if I take some of these out see it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.320 
but if I take some of these out see it
just<00:02:28.870> Falls<00:02:29.050> immediately<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.180> messing

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
just Falls immediately and I was messing

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
just Falls immediately and I was messing
with<00:02:31.510> other<00:02:31.780> arrangements<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.709> see<00:02:32.890> if<00:02:32.980> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
with other arrangements to see if I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.410 
with other arrangements to see if I
could<00:02:33.580> save<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.680> guys<00:02:35.680> from<00:02:35.920> being<00:02:36.100> shot<00:02:36.420> like

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
could save the guys from being shot like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.570 
could save the guys from being shot like
if<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.989> them<00:02:38.230> half<00:02:38.820> step<00:02:39.820> lower<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
if I have them half step lower the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.670 
if I have them half step lower the
problem<00:02:42.820> with<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:44.260> shoot<00:02:44.530> out<00:02:44.650> of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
problem with this is they shoot out of

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.090 
problem with this is they shoot out of
their<00:02:44.890> head<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.400> they<00:02:45.489> have<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.030> jump<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:47.100> to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
their head and they have to jump in to

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.340 
their head and they have to jump in to
be<00:02:48.580> able<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.790> shoot<00:02:48.940> them<00:02:49.120> which<00:02:49.959> they<00:02:49.989> don't

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
be able to shoot them which they don't

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.990 
be able to shoot them which they don't
always<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.769> they'll<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.130> sit<00:02:51.310> here<00:02:51.519> shooting

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
always do they'll just sit here shooting

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.320 
always do they'll just sit here shooting
for<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> while<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.910> they<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.209> also

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
for a while it but and they can also

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.309 
for a while it but and they can also
still<00:02:55.660> get<00:02:55.780> shot<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.860> didn't<00:02:57.069> work<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
still get shot so that didn't work the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.780 
still get shot so that didn't work the
last<00:02:59.470> idea<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.010> had<00:03:00.250> was<00:03:00.690> if<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
last idea I had was if you have the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.039 
last idea I had was if you have the
snowmen<00:03:03.790> one<00:03:04.120> step<00:03:04.420> below<00:03:04.660> them<00:03:05.850> then<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.390> full

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
snowmen one step below them then a full

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.650 
snowmen one step below them then a full
step<00:03:08.290> below<00:03:08.440> them<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:09.459> if<00:03:09.820> they<00:03:10.030> could<00:03:10.269> still

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
step below them then if they could still

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.630 
step below them then if they could still
shoot<00:03:10.900> them<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.650> seems<00:03:12.040> they<00:03:12.220> take<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.459> little

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
shoot them it seems they take a little

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.060 
shoot them it seems they take a little
longer<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:14.110> pay<00:03:14.290> attention<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.709> these<00:03:14.829> guys

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
longer to pay attention to these guys

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.620 
longer to pay attention to these guys
though

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.010 

because<00:03:19.230> he'll<00:03:19.650> sit<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.720> look<00:03:21.720> at<00:03:21.930> them

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
because he'll sit there and look at them

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.870 
because he'll sit there and look at them
and<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.380> think<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:22.740> can<00:03:22.950> still<00:03:23.190> get<00:03:23.340> shot<00:03:23.550> not

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and I think they can still get shot not

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.430 
and I think they can still get shot not
too<00:03:24.090> sure<00:03:24.300> because<00:03:24.480> these<00:03:24.840> guys<00:03:25.020> take<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.260> while

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
too sure because these guys take a while

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.200 
too sure because these guys take a while
let's<00:03:25.920> see<00:03:26.040> what<00:03:26.130> happens

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.660 

but<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.890> pretty<00:03:32.890> sure<00:03:33.130> they<00:03:33.250> were<00:03:33.310> getting<00:03:33.610> shot

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
but I pretty sure they were getting shot

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.070 
but I pretty sure they were getting shot
earlier<00:03:36.030> spawn<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> bunch<00:03:37.330> in<00:03:37.450> here<00:03:37.750> see<00:03:37.960> what

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
earlier spawn a bunch in here see what

happens yep there we go it's one just

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.900 
happens yep there we go it's one just
got<00:03:42.550> shot<00:03:42.790> there<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.360> they're<00:03:43.860> so

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.250 

they<00:03:47.540> all<00:03:47.690> have<00:03:48.230> their<00:03:48.410> flaws<00:03:48.650> sing<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:49.990> they

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.700 

can't<00:03:54.260> nope<00:03:55.010> where<00:03:55.580> they<00:03:56.090> shooting<00:03:56.420> at<00:03:56.710> other

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
can't nope where they shooting at other

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.100 
can't nope where they shooting at other
some<00:03:57.950> over<00:03:58.130> here<00:03:58.160> still<00:03:58.720> yeah<00:03:59.720> they<00:03:59.930> still

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
some over here still yeah they still

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.020 
some over here still yeah they still
can't<00:04:00.350> go<00:04:00.470> see<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.490> doesn't<00:04:01.880> really

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
can't go see this one doesn't really

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.150 
can't go see this one doesn't really
work<00:04:02.210> at<00:04:02.330> all<00:04:02.450> these<00:04:02.750> two<00:04:02.990> are<00:04:03.350> okay<00:04:03.800> this

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
work at all these two are okay this

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.500 
work at all these two are okay this
one's<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.400> little<00:04:04.460> faster<00:04:04.970> but<00:04:05.210> they<00:04:05.300> still

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
one's a little faster but they still

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.620 
one's a little faster but they still
both<00:04:05.690> get<00:04:05.870> shot<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.820> hopefully<00:04:08.330> someone

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
both get shot in so hopefully someone

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.600 
both get shot in so hopefully someone
else<00:04:08.960> can<00:04:09.110> figure<00:04:09.380> out<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.590> way<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:10.250> make<00:04:10.430> them

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
else can figure out a way to make them

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.470 
else can figure out a way to make them
not<00:04:11.000> get<00:04:11.270> shot<00:04:11.570> by<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.050> skeletons<00:04:13.480> creepers

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
not get shot by the skeletons creepers

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.820 
not get shot by the skeletons creepers
seemed<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.780> be<00:04:14.870> fine<00:04:15.080> they<00:04:15.410> don't<00:04:15.560> seem<00:04:15.800> to

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
seemed to be fine they don't seem to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.479 
seemed to be fine they don't seem to
explode<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:18.560> right<00:04:18.709> now<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:18.950> then<00:04:19.040> they<00:04:19.220> do

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
explode and I right now and then they do

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.270 
explode and I right now and then they do
stop<00:04:20.260> reacting<00:04:21.260> for<00:04:21.620> some<00:04:21.799> reason<00:04:22.100> I'm<00:04:22.250> not

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
stop reacting for some reason I'm not

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
stop reacting for some reason I'm not
exactly<00:04:22.610> sure<00:04:22.820> why<00:04:23.350> but<00:04:24.350> like<00:04:25.300> their

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
exactly sure why but like their

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.140 
exactly sure why but like their
attention<00:04:26.750> span<00:04:26.990> isn't<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.350> great<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.560> guess

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
attention span isn't that great I guess

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.930 
attention span isn't that great I guess
they<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:31.100> right<00:04:31.280> now<00:04:31.430> they<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.700> don't<00:04:31.820> want

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
they like right now they just don't want

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.490 
they like right now they just don't want
to<00:04:32.000> work<00:04:34.180> when<00:04:35.180> you<00:04:35.240> saw<00:04:35.390> earlier<00:04:35.420> that<00:04:36.290> it<00:04:36.410> was

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
to work when you saw earlier that it was

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.550 
to work when you saw earlier that it was
working<00:04:38.650> yeah<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.280> just<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.610> new<00:04:40.970> idea<00:04:41.470> see<00:04:42.470> if

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
working yeah so just a new idea see if

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.830 
working yeah so just a new idea see if
it<00:04:42.710> people<00:04:43.280> can<00:04:43.400> improve<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.030> make<00:04:44.420> full

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
it people can improve it and make full

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.110 
it people can improve it and make full
MOPP<00:04:45.050> systems<00:04:45.440> out<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:46.190> since<00:04:47.030> it

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
MOPP systems out of it it since it

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.960 
MOPP systems out of it it since it
doesn't<00:04:47.240> use<00:04:47.420> pistons<00:04:47.840> it'll<00:04:48.230> I<00:04:48.760> think<00:04:49.760> be

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
doesn't use pistons it'll I think be

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.250 
doesn't use pistons it'll I think be
less<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:52.420> computer<00:04:53.420> intensive<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.110> won't

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
less a computer intensive so you won't

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.520 
less a computer intensive so you won't
have<00:04:54.380> as<00:04:54.530> much<00:04:54.830> wyd<00:04:55.220> compared<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.530> piston

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
have as much wyd compared to a piston

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.450 
have as much wyd compared to a piston
one<00:04:58.030> also<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.660> don't<00:04:59.840> need<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.310> piston<00:05:01.310> /

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
one also you don't need like a piston /

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.480 
one also you don't need like a piston /
block<00:05:01.700> space<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.870> know<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> row<00:05:03.440> of

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
block space you have you know a row of

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.790 
block space you have you know a row of
snow<00:05:04.490> golems<00:05:04.960> for<00:05:05.960> every<00:05:06.230> like<00:05:06.440> four<00:05:06.770> rows

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
snow golems for every like four rows

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.550 
snow golems for every like four rows
think<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.790> range<00:05:08.060> was<00:05:08.330> out<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.750> hear<00:05:09.320> that

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
think the range was out to hear that

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.870 
think the range was out to hear that
they<00:05:09.680> could<00:05:09.860> make<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.130> think<00:05:10.220> was<00:05:10.370> like<00:05:10.460> nine

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
they could make it think was like nine

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.870 
they could make it think was like nine
or<00:05:10.910> ten<00:05:11.330> spots<00:05:12.130> there<00:05:13.130> we<00:05:13.190> go<00:05:13.280> maybe<00:05:13.700> they're

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
or ten spots there we go maybe they're

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.600 
or ten spots there we go maybe they're
paying<00:05:14.450> attention<00:05:14.780> again

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
paying attention again

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.969 
paying attention again
yeah<00:05:17.150> they<00:05:17.509> can<00:05:17.659> just<00:05:17.870> do<00:05:18.080> that<00:05:18.199> and<00:05:18.469> I<00:05:18.650> think

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
yeah they can just do that and I think

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.589 
yeah they can just do that and I think
from<00:05:19.909> what<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.120> saw<00:05:20.330> creepers<00:05:20.870> were<00:05:21.139> fine<00:05:22.599> they

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
from what I saw creepers were fine they

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.659 
from what I saw creepers were fine they
weren't<00:05:23.840> exploding<00:05:24.349> I've<00:05:24.979> already<00:05:25.159> said<00:05:25.460> that

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
weren't exploding I've already said that

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.350 
weren't exploding I've already said that
I<00:05:26.409> will<00:05:27.409> go<00:05:27.530> ahead<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.770> test<00:05:27.949> it<00:05:28.159> though

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.490 

yeah<00:05:33.349> yeah

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
yeah yeah

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.470 
yeah yeah
if<00:05:36.460> they're<00:05:36.700> there<00:05:36.940> they<00:05:37.780> don't<00:05:37.900> seem<00:05:38.140> to<00:05:38.260> be<00:05:38.380> a

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
if they're there they don't seem to be a

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.320 
if they're there they don't seem to be a
even<00:05:40.480> if<00:05:40.570> they're<00:05:40.950> good<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.640> might<00:05:42.850> get<00:05:43.000> close

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
even if they're good it might get close

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.570 
even if they're good it might get close
they<00:05:43.630> might<00:05:43.810> need<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.140> be<00:05:44.290> not<00:05:45.070> have<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.340> row

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
they might need to be not have a row

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.530 
they might need to be not have a row
right<00:05:45.760> here<00:05:45.790> OOP<00:05:47.100> yep<00:05:48.100> there<00:05:48.370> we<00:05:48.490> go<00:05:48.610> so

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
right here OOP yep there we go so

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.200 
right here OOP yep there we go so
probably<00:05:50.020> shouldn't<00:05:50.320> have<00:05:50.380> a<00:05:50.530> row<00:05:51.120> right<00:05:52.120> in

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
probably shouldn't have a row right in

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.020 
probably shouldn't have a row right in
front<00:05:52.420> of<00:05:52.510> them<00:05:52.690> because<00:05:53.620> it'll<00:05:54.580> blow<00:05:54.790> up<00:05:54.850> like

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
front of them because it'll blow up like

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.750 
front of them because it'll blow up like
that<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.650> then<00:05:57.420> but<00:05:58.420> that's<00:05:58.870> my<00:05:59.110> idea<00:05:59.500> and

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
that and then but that's my idea and

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.130 
that and then but that's my idea and
hopefully<00:06:00.760> you<00:06:01.120> guys<00:06:01.300> can<00:06:01.360> improve<00:06:01.870> on<00:06:02.020> it

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
hopefully you guys can improve on it

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.250 
hopefully you guys can improve on it
thanks<00:06:02.710> for<00:06:02.830> watching<00:06:03.100> bye
