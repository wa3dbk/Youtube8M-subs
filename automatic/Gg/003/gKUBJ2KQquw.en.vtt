it's<00:00:30.990> quality<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> sheath<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's quality I think the sheath is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.490 
it's quality I think the sheath is
better<00:00:33.239> better<00:00:33.899> made<00:00:34.579> than<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.329> belt<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.500> but

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
better better made than the belt so but

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.090 
better better made than the belt so but
that<00:00:40.680> said<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:42.350> not<00:00:43.350> getting<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:43.739> quite

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that said and not getting there quite

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.639 
that said and not getting there quite

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
here and the blade starts here so

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.110 
here and the blade starts here so
there's<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:55.520> fairly<00:02:56.750> big<00:02:57.750> disadvantage<00:02:59.120> but

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
there's a fairly big disadvantage but

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.880 
there's a fairly big disadvantage but
because<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.990> way<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.470> handle

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
because of the way that the handle

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.930 
because of the way that the handle
shaped<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:03.210> has<00:03:03.420> an<00:03:04.130> hourglass<00:03:05.130> shaping<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.790> it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
shaped it has an hourglass shaping to it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.710 
shaped it has an hourglass shaping to it
and<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.720> notch<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.500> your<00:03:08.370> hand<00:03:08.640> isn't<00:03:09.000> it

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and this notch that your hand isn't it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.190 
and this notch that your hand isn't it
doesn't<00:03:10.080> move<00:03:10.230> from<00:03:11.450> no<00:03:12.450> matter<00:03:12.630> what<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.050> do

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
doesn't move from no matter what you do

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.350 
doesn't move from no matter what you do
from<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.370> handle<00:03:17.090> says<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:19.140> was

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
from the handle says here that it was

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.450 
from the handle says here that it was
made<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.390> India<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.880> pick<00:03:24.120> up<00:03:24.270> on<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:25.460> so

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
made in India you can pick up on that so

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.730 
made in India you can pick up on that so
it<00:03:26.520> was<00:03:26.610> made<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.000> India<00:03:28.340> supposedly<00:03:30.290> um<00:03:31.290> has<00:03:31.710> a

it was made in India supposedly um has a
nice<00:03:31.980> groove<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:34.520> don't<00:03:35.520> know<00:03:35.670> what

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
nice groove in it and don't know what

nice groove in it and don't know what
this<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.480> seems<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> trademark

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
this is but it seems like a trademark

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.730 
this is but it seems like a trademark
symbol<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.910> they<00:03:39.180> would<00:03:39.360> have<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.590> most<00:03:40.590> of

symbol that they would have on most of
their<00:03:40.890> knives<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:43.410> again<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.770> do<00:03:43.830> not

doll<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:52.830> have<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.220> sharpen<00:03:53.459> them<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.720> can

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
doll so you have to sharpen them you can

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.360 
doll so you have to sharpen them you can
see<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.470> blade<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.830> mine<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.220> all

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
see that the blade on mine is all

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.670 
see that the blade on mine is all
scratched<00:03:56.730> but<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.900> polish<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.910> um

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
scratched but you can polish that out um

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.470 
scratched but you can polish that out um
the<00:04:01.680> reason<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.160> scratched<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.209> because

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the reason it's scratched it's because

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.960 
the reason it's scratched it's because
the<00:04:03.630> easiest<00:04:03.990> way<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.560> found<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.400> sharpen<00:04:05.790> these

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
the easiest way I found to sharpen these

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.180 
the easiest way I found to sharpen these
is<00:04:06.240> with<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.500> heavy-duty<00:04:08.010> file<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.620> what<00:04:11.070> you

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
is with a heavy-duty file and what you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.699 
is with a heavy-duty file and what you
do<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:11.670> tape<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.150> or<00:04:12.450> whatever<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.410> do<00:04:13.560> is

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
do is you tape it or whatever you do is

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.550 
do is you tape it or whatever you do is
secure<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:15.510> a

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.009 

you<00:04:20.160> secure<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.760> some<00:04:21.000> kind<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.480> post<00:04:21.810> or

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
you secure it to some kind of post or

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.409 
you secure it to some kind of post or
something<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:23.100> what<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.310> did<00:04:23.550> was<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:23.910> secured

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
something and what I did was I secured

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.129 
something and what I did was I secured
it<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:25.700> my<00:04:26.720> arm<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.020> chair<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:30.139> took

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
it to my arm in my chair so I just took

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.320 
it to my arm in my chair so I just took
tape<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:32.100> put<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:32.550> here<00:04:32.820> now<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.270> is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
tape and put it on here now this is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.490 
tape and put it on here now this is
obviously<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:35.210> way<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.870> simplest<00:04:37.260> way

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
obviously a way like the simplest way

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.740 
obviously a way like the simplest way
you<00:04:37.560> could<00:04:37.740> do<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.580> used<00:04:38.910> packing<00:04:39.570> tape

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
you could do it and I used packing tape

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.250 
you could do it and I used packing tape
taped<00:04:40.230> it<00:04:40.380> here<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.190> here<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.870> took<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
taped it here and here and I took the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.280 
taped it here and here and I took the
knife<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:44.880> would<00:04:45.060> do<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.480> just<00:04:45.870> run<00:04:46.169> it

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
knife and what I would do is just run it

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.219 
knife and what I would do is just run it
up<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.650> down<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:49.680> file<00:04:51.050> but<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.139> would

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
up and down the the file but it would

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.400 
up and down the the file but it would
obviously<00:04:52.530> make<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.389> noise<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.110> wasn't

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
obviously make a noise that I wasn't

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.580 
obviously make a noise that I wasn't
trying<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.770> sharpen<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:57.450> what<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.080> do<00:04:58.320> is

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
trying to sharpen it and what you do is

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.440 
trying to sharpen it and what you do is
all<00:04:58.919> these<00:04:59.100> knives<00:04:59.310> come<00:04:59.639> with<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.790> nice<00:05:00.030> and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
all these knives come with a nice and

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.300 
all these knives come with a nice and
groove<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:00.870> them<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.530> it's<00:05:01.919> not<00:05:02.040> gonna<00:05:02.160> be

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
groove in them and it's not gonna be

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.520 
groove in them and it's not gonna be
like<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.460> pocket<00:05:03.000> knife

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
like a pocket knife

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.180 
like a pocket knife
where<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.400> knife<00:05:06.500> itself<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.889> the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
where you have the knife itself and the

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.310 
where you have the knife itself and the
blade<00:05:08.460> curves<00:05:08.850> down<00:05:09.060> so<00:05:09.750> it's<00:05:09.900> not<00:05:09.990> gonna<00:05:10.139> be

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
blade curves down so it's not gonna be

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.920 
blade curves down so it's not gonna be
like<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.500> triangular<00:05:11.010> blade<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.630> gonna

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
like a triangular blade this is gonna

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.290 
like a triangular blade this is gonna
stop<00:05:13.350> here<00:05:13.680> it's<00:05:13.889> gonna<00:05:14.010> be<00:05:14.160> flat<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.790> you're

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
stop here it's gonna be flat and you're

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.020 
stop here it's gonna be flat and you're
just<00:05:15.450> gonna<00:05:15.540> follow<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.320> groove<00:05:17.450> with<00:05:18.450> your

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.120 

it<00:05:32.800> just<00:05:34.320> goes<00:05:35.320> inwards<00:05:35.889> right<00:05:36.220> there<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:38.130> would

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
it just goes inwards right there I would

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.300 
it just goes inwards right there I would
just<00:05:39.250> kind<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:39.639> slant<00:05:39.970> downward<00:05:41.160> that's<00:05:42.160> what

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
just kind of slant downward that's what

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.730 
just kind of slant downward that's what
you're<00:05:42.430> gonna<00:05:42.520> be<00:05:42.729> following<00:05:43.889> so<00:05:46.620> it's<00:05:47.620> not

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
you're gonna be following so it's not

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.240 
you're gonna be following so it's not
gonna<00:05:47.860> be<00:05:48.040> like<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.570> pocket<00:05:49.570> knife<00:05:50.130> or<00:05:51.130> like<00:05:51.970> a

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
gonna be like a pocket knife or like a

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.350 
gonna be like a pocket knife or like a
regular<00:05:54.250> knife<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:54.729> I<00:05:54.760> got<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.350> how<00:05:56.350> this<00:05:57.360> has

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
regular knife so I got that how this has

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.600 
regular knife so I got that how this has
a<00:05:58.389> big<00:05:58.660> group<00:05:58.930> here<00:05:59.139> and<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.860> follows<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.430> down

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
a big group here and it follows it down

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.900 
a big group here and it follows it down
but<00:06:01.330> then<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.660> blade<00:06:01.990> actually<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:03.100> this<00:06:03.699> is

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
but then the blade actually it this is

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.150 
but then the blade actually it this is
not<00:06:04.060> part<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.479> blade<00:06:04.690> the<00:06:05.500> blade<00:06:05.770> itself

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
not part of the blade the blade itself

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:19.219 
not part of the blade the blade itself
starts<00:06:08.160> right<00:06:09.160> here

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.350 

trying<00:06:19.889> to<00:06:20.009> get<00:06:20.129> this<00:06:20.279> so<00:06:20.699> we<00:06:20.789> can<00:06:20.939> see<00:06:21.180> it<00:06:21.300> on

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
trying to get this so we can see it on

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.249 
trying to get this so we can see it on
the<00:06:21.479> camera<00:06:22.520> itself<00:06:23.520> starts<00:06:25.009> right<00:06:26.009> here<00:06:27.259> so

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
the camera itself starts right here so

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.909 
the camera itself starts right here so
you<00:06:28.379> can<00:06:28.529> see<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:28.949> triangular<00:06:29.849> part<00:06:30.180> of<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.919> so

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
you can see the triangular part of it so

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.950 
you can see the triangular part of it so
it<00:06:32.279> doesn't<00:06:32.580> start<00:06:32.729> at<00:06:32.879> the<00:06:32.969> groove<00:06:33.270> it<00:06:33.539> starts

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
it doesn't start at the groove it starts

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.950 
it doesn't start at the groove it starts
there<00:06:34.860> up<00:06:35.699> for<00:06:35.909> the<00:06:35.969> kukri<00:06:36.300> what<00:06:36.749> you're<00:06:36.840> gonna

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
there up for the kukri what you're gonna

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.459 
there up for the kukri what you're gonna
have<00:06:37.199> to<00:06:37.319> do<00:06:37.469> is<00:06:38.189> start<00:06:38.669> it<00:06:38.819> and<00:06:39.449> it<00:06:39.719> comes<00:06:40.199> down

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469 
have to do is start it and it comes down

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.029 
have to do is start it and it comes down
through<00:06:40.770> guru<00:06:41.279> so<00:06:42.090> then<00:06:42.270> it<00:06:42.389> has<00:06:42.629> a<00:06:43.110> sturdy

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
through guru so then it has a sturdy

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.920 
through guru so then it has a sturdy
edge<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:45.569> it

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
edge to it

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.899 
edge to it
and<00:06:46.439> what<00:06:46.590> that'll<00:06:46.800> do<00:06:47.039> is<00:06:47.069> it'll<00:06:47.310> keep<00:06:47.729> it

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
and what that'll do is it'll keep it

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.320 
and what that'll do is it'll keep it
sharper<00:06:48.360> for<00:06:48.569> longer<00:06:49.099> instead<00:06:50.099> of<00:06:50.400> it's<00:06:51.060> more

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
sharper for longer instead of it's more

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.769 
sharper for longer instead of it's more
for<00:06:51.629> chopping<00:06:52.229> than<00:06:52.589> slicing<00:06:53.240> and<00:06:54.240> more<00:06:54.449> for

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:54.779 
for chopping than slicing and more for

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.469 
for chopping than slicing and more for
like<00:06:55.080> that<00:06:55.319> machete<00:06:55.919> style<00:06:56.370> but<00:06:57.089> with<00:06:57.240> more

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
like that machete style but with more

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.749 
like that machete style but with more
power<00:06:57.839> than<00:06:58.020> a<00:06:58.259> machete<00:06:58.650> because<00:06:59.370> when<00:06:59.639> you're

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
power than a machete because when you're

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.300 
power than a machete because when you're
cutting<00:07:00.529> instead<00:07:01.529> of<00:07:01.650> straight<00:07:02.009> cutting

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
cutting instead of straight cutting

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.499 
cutting instead of straight cutting
instead<00:07:03.270> of<00:07:03.389> just<00:07:03.539> cutting<00:07:03.839> chunk<00:07:04.710> of<00:07:04.860> wood<00:07:05.509> it

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
instead of just cutting chunk of wood it

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.110 
instead of just cutting chunk of wood it
won't<00:07:06.779> just<00:07:06.960> be<00:07:07.080> using<00:07:07.379> your<00:07:07.800> force<00:07:08.129> it'll<00:07:08.999> be

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
won't just be using your force it'll be

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.469 
won't just be using your force it'll be
like<00:07:09.300> taking<00:07:09.779> it<00:07:09.870> in<00:07:10.400> like<00:07:11.400> increasing<00:07:12.210> the

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 
like taking it in like increasing the

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.869 
like taking it in like increasing the
power<00:07:12.810> of<00:07:13.169> the<00:07:13.349> chop<00:07:13.620> because<00:07:14.219> of<00:07:14.550> the<00:07:14.639> curved

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 
power of the chop because of the curved

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:21.379 
power of the chop because of the curved
blade<00:07:16.699> so<00:07:18.830> that's<00:07:19.830> really<00:07:20.039> it<00:07:20.219> for<00:07:20.430> now<00:07:20.550> maybe

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 
blade so that's really it for now maybe

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.990 
blade so that's really it for now maybe
later<00:07:21.539> I<00:07:21.839> will<00:07:22.050> do<00:07:22.409> a<00:07:24.919> field<00:07:25.919> not<00:07:26.430> a<00:07:26.460> field<00:07:26.759> test

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
later I will do a field not a field test

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.159 
later I will do a field not a field test
but<00:07:27.240> just<00:07:27.419> a<00:07:27.539> test<00:07:27.779> for<00:07:27.930> us<00:07:28.229> and<00:07:29.899> that's<00:07:30.899> really

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:31.169 
but just a test for us and that's really

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:34.430 
but just a test for us and that's really
it<00:07:31.560> but
