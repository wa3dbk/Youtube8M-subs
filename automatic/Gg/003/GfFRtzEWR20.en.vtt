in<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> polyester<00:00:06.779> world<00:00:07.580> remember<00:00:08.580> that

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
in the polyester world remember that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.570 
in the polyester world remember that
black<00:00:08.970> when<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.300> had<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:10.160> that<00:00:11.160> fooled<00:00:11.429> most

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
black when we had first that fooled most

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.650 
black when we had first that fooled most
of<00:00:11.759> us<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.910> looked<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.150> cotton<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.570> was

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
of us that looked like cotton it was

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
that's a spun poly the other polyester

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.429 
that's a spun poly the other polyester
is<00:00:16.320> called<00:00:16.560> filament<00:00:17.340> polyester<00:00:18.260> every<00:00:19.260> time

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
is called filament polyester every time

premium polyester here's where it came

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.619 
premium polyester here's where it came
from<00:00:52.219> one<00:00:53.219> day<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> scientists<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.210> looking<00:00:54.329> at

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
from one day a scientists are looking at

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
from one day a scientists are looking at
the<00:00:54.780> fibers<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.379> silk<00:00:55.680> under<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> microscope

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the fibers of silk under a microscope

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
the fibers of silk under a microscope
and<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.390> fibers<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> silkworm

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and the fibers that the silkworm

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.630 
and the fibers that the silkworm
produces<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.820> round<00:01:01.010> they're<00:01:02.010> trilobal

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
produces are not round they're trilobal

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.310 
produces are not round they're trilobal
means<00:01:03.059> they're<00:01:03.270> three-sided<00:01:03.840> think<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.140> like

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
means they're three-sided think of like

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
means they're three-sided think of like
a<00:01:04.350> Toblerone<00:01:05.040> candy<00:01:05.280> bar<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.880> connect<00:01:06.180> with

a Toblerone candy bar we connect with

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
a Toblerone candy bar we connect with
chocolate<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> three

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
chocolate right so you got the three

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.289 
chocolate right so you got the three

what<00:01:12.450> happens<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.799> flat<00:01:13.979> flat<00:01:14.250> flat

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
what happens because it's flat flat flat

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
what happens because it's flat flat flat
the<00:01:15.479> light<00:01:15.630> hits<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.020> reflects

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the light hits it and reflects

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.539 
the light hits it and reflects
beautifully<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.220> gives<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
beautifully that's what gives it the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.320 
beautifully that's what gives it the
machine<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> he<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.530> thinking<00:01:19.860> okay<00:01:20.299> can<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
machine so he was thinking okay can I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.200 
machine so he was thinking okay can I
make<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.229> polyester<00:01:23.030> usually<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.119> they

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
make that in polyester usually when they

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.530 
make that in polyester usually when they
make<00:01:24.330> polyester<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.740> big<00:01:26.330> pot<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
make polyester they have this big pot of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.140 
make polyester they have this big pot of
the<00:01:28.259> poly<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.460> thick<00:01:29.700> honey<00:01:29.939> like

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the poly kind of a thick honey like

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
the poly kind of a thick honey like
substance<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:31.680> push<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.220> through<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
substance and they push it through a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.240 
substance and they push it through a
showerhead<00:01:32.939> nozzle<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.439> showerhead<00:01:34.829> nozzle

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
showerhead nozzle the showerhead nozzle

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.700 
showerhead nozzle the showerhead nozzle
has<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> hundred<00:01:35.880> microscopic<00:01:36.780> holes<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
has a hundred microscopic holes in it so

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.080 
has a hundred microscopic holes in it so
it<00:01:37.799> comes<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> shower<00:01:38.520> nozzle<00:01:38.820> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it comes out of the shower nozzle in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
it comes out of the shower nozzle in
miles<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> miles<00:01:40.110> long<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.619> spaghetti-like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
miles and miles long of spaghetti-like

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.690 
miles and miles long of spaghetti-like
strands<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.060> thread<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.520> take

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
strands of thread and then they take

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
strands of thread and then they take
these<00:01:44.850> micro<00:01:45.360> fine<00:01:45.630> strands<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.380> twist

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
these micro fine strands and they twist

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.710 
these micro fine strands and they twist
them<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> polyester<00:01:47.310> thread<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
them to make a polyester thread like the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
them to make a polyester thread like the
sole<00:01:48.899> fine<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.860> he<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.040> thinking<00:01:50.490> because

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
sole fine when he got thinking because

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.690 
sole fine when he got thinking because
under<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> microscope<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.710> silk<00:01:52.950> road<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.549> f

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
under the microscope the silk road is f

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
under the microscope the silk road is f
three-sided<00:01:54.390> thread<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
three-sided thread can I do that to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.090 
three-sided thread can I do that to
Paulie

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Paulie

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
Paulie
so<00:01:56.310> he<00:01:56.399> took<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.700> showerhead<00:01:57.060> nozzle<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so he took that showerhead nozzle and it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
so he took that showerhead nozzle and it
changed<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> round<00:01:59.040> holes<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.640> triangular

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
changed the round holes to triangular

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
changed the round holes to triangular
holes<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.680> push<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> polyester

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
holes so now when you push the polyester

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.920 
holes so now when you push the polyester
through<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:03.090> came<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> miles<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
through they came out in the miles a
