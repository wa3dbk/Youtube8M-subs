00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 monsters but we know you have a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 special way of invoking and this is what 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.220

 That I'll show the way, no. 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.019
 traditional way of invoking it good has the three 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.270

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.600

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.659

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.329
 to win appear in this game of darkness 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:40.740
 When I call your name dragon 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:43.200
 Rock side of joke because maybe 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 the bullshit but let's go, yeah and there guys 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.509
 This video is merely humorous. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.430
 to be taken seriously if you do 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.100
 This world is smacked in the face of the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.229
 opponent and finally the dragon next to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.909
 ray is here and does not say tax 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.659
 monster no 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.520
 cool right then this is a millennium rack 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.000
 that only the ancient pharaohs were able to 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.090
 do and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.050
 Are you here and looking for some class? 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.480
 of real duel 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.820
 So, what are you going to take with you? 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.840
 dislike but that's it right there 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.350
 another uproar these areas invocations 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.270
 in the drawing 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.820
 probably the next one will be crying 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.350
 in dragon things has anyone seen that 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.410
 that he goes there and does a lot of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.010
 and color
