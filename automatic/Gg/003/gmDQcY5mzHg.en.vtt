00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.900 
expect from architecture in that sense
it's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.450> very<00:00:36.690> honest<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.920> arcade<00:00:38.550> or

it's a very honest or a arcade or
architecture<00:00:40.220> typological<00:00:41.220> you<00:00:41.280> could<00:00:41.460> also

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
architecture typological you could also

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.220 
architecture typological you could also
say<00:00:41.970> that<00:00:42.000> somehow<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:42.870> building

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
say that somehow this is a building

say that somehow this is a building
built<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.590> stilts<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.570> sometimes<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.720> has

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
built on stilts because sometimes it has

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.060 
built on stilts because sometimes it has
floods<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.640> build<00:00:47.850> layers<00:00:48.800> which<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
floods and then to build layers which is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.210 
floods and then to build layers which is
anything<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:50.970> a<00:00:51.360> trellis<00:00:51.900> like<00:00:52.200> roof<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
kind of a trellis under which you can

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.930 
kind of a trellis under which you can
park<00:00:59.220> your<00:00:59.280> car<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:01.140> also<00:01:01.470> is<00:01:02.160> open<00:01:02.730> to

park your car and that also is open to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
park your car and that also is open to
the<00:01:03.060> elements<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> everything<00:01:04.860> literally

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the elements so everything literally

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.910 
the elements so everything literally
everything<00:01:05.550> is<00:01:06.330> visible<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.260> part<00:01:07.620> of<00:01:07.770> the

everything is visible is part of the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.649 
everything is visible is part of the
whole<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:09.810> wanted<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.470> buildings

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
whole we wanted to do buildings

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
whole we wanted to do buildings
transparent<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.810> thermal<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.250> inside

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
transparent or thermal so that inside

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
transparent or thermal so that inside
outside<00:01:15.390> would<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> strict<00:01:16.470> barrier

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
outside would not be a strict barrier

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.120 
outside would not be a strict barrier
but<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> would<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.050> landscape<00:01:19.979> will

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but it would be you know landscape will

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490 
but it would be you know landscape will
walk<00:01:20.460> inside<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> building<00:01:21.510> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
walk inside the building if you think of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
walk inside the building if you think of
all<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.770> plans<00:01:23.010> we've<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.550> introducing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
all the plans we've been introducing

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.410 
all the plans we've been introducing
especially<00:01:25.170> visual<00:01:26.010> connections<00:01:26.640> between

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
waterside the special concept of the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.250 
waterside the special concept of the
museum<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.760> this<00:01:38.760> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.110> sequence<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
museum which is this kind of sequence of

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.380 
museum which is this kind of sequence of
spaces<00:01:40.830> which<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.310> between<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.150> called

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
spaces which is between so called

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.649 
spaces which is between so called
overview<00:01:42.960> galleries<00:01:43.440> which<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> fluids

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
overview galleries which on the fluids

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.230 
overview galleries which on the fluids
where<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> walk<00:01:46.110> between<00:01:46.560> spaces<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.520> anchor

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
where you walk between spaces and anchor

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.990 
where you walk between spaces and anchor
in<00:01:48.330> places<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.380> fixed<00:01:49.860> spaces<00:01:50.580> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
in places which are more fixed spaces is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.680 
in places which are more fixed spaces is
a<00:01:51.330> new<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.619> museum<00:01:52.920> topology<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:54.390> we

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
a new kind of a museum topology which we

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.950 
a new kind of a museum topology which we
believed<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.260> right<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.100> here

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
believed was right to do here

amazing<00:02:02.660> founding<00:02:03.530> director<00:02:04.210> together<00:02:05.210> with

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
amazing founding director together with

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.310 
amazing founding director together with
whom<00:02:05.600> we<00:02:05.810> developed<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.530> concept<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:09.200> other

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320

term<00:02:09.590> staircase<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.369> an<00:02:10.520> attempt<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.930> more

term staircase is an attempt to do more

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.340 
term staircase is an attempt to do more
than<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.650> let's<00:02:13.430> say<00:02:13.610> an<00:02:13.820> auditorium<00:02:14.480> that

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
than just let's say an auditorium that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.250 
than just let's say an auditorium that
would<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.130> space<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.000> closed<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.900> is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
would be a space that is closed and is

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320 
would be a space that is closed and is
only<00:02:18.440> used<00:02:18.800> when<00:02:19.010> there<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.490> performance<00:02:20.000> or

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
only used when there is a performance or

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.420 
only used when there is a performance or
a<00:02:20.360> conference<00:02:20.900> or<00:02:21.110> whatever<00:02:21.440> but<00:02:22.280> to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
a conference or whatever but to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.220 
a conference or whatever but to
introduce<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> grand<00:02:23.870> stair

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
introduce it so you have a grand stair

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
introduce it so you have a grand stair
leading<00:02:24.590> people<00:02:24.770> up<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.280> main<00:02:25.459> gallery
