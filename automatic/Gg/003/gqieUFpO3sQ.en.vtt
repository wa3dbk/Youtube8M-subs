00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:12.139
 well this is the second day of must more 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.139
 an artisanal wine production 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:24.920
 Yesterday I but I will be these today. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:41.010
 approximately four kilos of grapes 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:53.489
 new on black grape may well say go 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:57.289
 niagara rosada already add sugar and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.289
 alcoholic fermentation has begun 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.280
 in those early days is the reason for having 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 a child of fruit is not yet 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.260
 confirmed wine with time is the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.260
 get there on the fourth day of fermentation 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.780
 fruit style goes fading and you go 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:43.200
 you start to smell the same wine and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:48.450
 this color of wine it leaves the bark 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.320
 then the first day you graduate 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.869
 will be the wacc to mix with sugar and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 to leave fermenting will not yet be 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.100
 this curve is much clearer with the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.830
 time the ink of the grape skin goes 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:10.289
 letting go of that wine color or 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:14.190
 substances other than those 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.370
 seed also help to give color and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.370
 flavor 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.849
 after seven days or five days if the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.379
 temperature is high here in 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.590
 Rio de Janeiro 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:43.790
 I will show up by four hours increasing 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.790
 practically 32 째 33 째 30 째 31 째 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:56.569
 I leave only 56 days ago and already 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:56.569
 bottle filtration 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:12.620
 this bottle and jattak and civil is already 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.980
 here decanting four days ago 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.349
 you can see that dirt from the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.680
 vih in the grape pulp the particles of 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.420
 grape pulp is already deposited in the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:38.239
 fermentation that is happening well 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:43.580
 slowly is asking in this phase here 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:46.220
 the vi already already has a an aroma taste of me 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.799
 but it is a very young wine still has a 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.230
 I like the fruit very well, it reminds me of the 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:59.170
 grape 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.170
 at the same time it has a valid flavor 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.700
 this second second stage here gives the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:17.120
 fermentation of wine is to place 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:21.169
 the wine in bottle sealed in contact 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.639
 with with you can make out in the lid 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.570
 of any bottle by placing this 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:33.200
 the other end of the rubber in the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:38.419
 container with water and this phase 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:43.850
 lasts approximately 40 30 40 days after 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:48.169
 This is going to take you out of this bottle. 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.890
 will filter and place the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.320
 bottle of new after washing bottle take out 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.180
 the bottom residue in leaving for another 30 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.520
 days 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.520
 and then yes you can bottle there was 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:17.180
 at this stage the wine he is acquiring 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:20.210
 more color flavor and alcohol also graduation 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:26.510
 alcoholic beverage is increasing 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:30.460
 more sugar you put more alcohol but 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.460
