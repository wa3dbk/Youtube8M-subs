to safari type in a link you'd find

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.459 
to safari type in a link you'd find
another<00:00:46.860> URL<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.820> link<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> page<00:00:48.600> tab

another URL or a link on the page tab
that<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.100> cydia<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:51.030> download<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that and cydia would download right to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
that and cydia would download right to
your<00:00:52.020> iPad<00:00:52.410> 2<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.190> unfortunately<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.969> leak

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
your iPad 2 and unfortunately this leak

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.709 
your iPad 2 and unfortunately this leak
only<00:00:54.750> worked<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.370> 4.3<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.390> whole

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
only worked for 4.3 but this whole

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.020 
only worked for 4.3 but this whole
jailbreak<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> coming<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.489> four<00:00:59.730> point

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
jailbreak is coming out for four point

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.990 
jailbreak is coming out for four point
three<00:01:00.090> point<00:01:00.359> three<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.559> believe<00:01:02.000> versions

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
three point three and i believe versions

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
three point three and i believe versions
below<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.650> shouldn't<00:01:04.860> be

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
below that also so we shouldn't be

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
below that also so we shouldn't be
worried<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.330> leaked

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
worried about that this is just leaked

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080 
worried about that this is just leaked
and<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.799> recommended<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and it's also not recommended to use it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.140 
and it's also not recommended to use it
because<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.220> beta<00:01:11.520> stage<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
because it is only in a beta stage and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.539 
because it is only in a beta stage and
not<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> final<00:01:12.900> release<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.830> final<00:01:14.010> release

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
not the final release the final release

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
not the final release the final release
should<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.420> coming<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.500> soon

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
should be coming out really really soon

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.859 
should be coming out really really soon
so<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.520> should<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.850> wait<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.600> wait

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so we should just wait for that we wait

so we should just wait for that we wait
we've<00:01:19.259> waited<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.710> long<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.909> ipad<00:01:21.270> 2

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we've waited this long for the ipad 2

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
we've waited this long for the ipad 2
jailbreak<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.680> why<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.520> wait<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> few

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
jailbreak so why not just wait a few

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630 
jailbreak so why not just wait a few
more<00:01:24.600> days<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> we'll<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> final<00:01:26.070> release

using the jailbreakme.com 3.0 method so
jailbreakme.com<00:01:39.200> basically<00:01:40.430> jailbroke<00:01:41.430> all

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
jailbreakme.com basically jailbroke all

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330 
jailbreakme.com basically jailbroke all
of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> devices<00:01:43.020> almost<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> devices

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
of the devices almost all of the devices

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.639 
of the devices almost all of the devices
on<00:01:44.970> four<00:01:45.360> point<00:01:45.630> oh<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> first

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on four point oh it was one of the first

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.800 
on four point oh it was one of the first
sites<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> easiest

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
sites so it was one of the easiest

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
sites so it was one of the easiest
jailbreaks<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.530> well<00:01:49.740> where<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> would<00:01:50.220> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
jailbreaks as well where you would just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.340 
jailbreaks as well where you would just
