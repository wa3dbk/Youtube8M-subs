gameplay<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.020> it's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
gameplay is going to be good and if it's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.020 
gameplay is going to be good and if it's
not<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:52.920> standards<00:00:52.949> than<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.879> to

not up to my standards than I have to
start<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.480> over<00:00:54.570> again<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.980> live

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
start all over again and if it's a live

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
start all over again and if it's a live
gameplay<00:00:56.489> there's<00:00:56.879> usually<00:00:57.000> something<00:00:57.360> you
