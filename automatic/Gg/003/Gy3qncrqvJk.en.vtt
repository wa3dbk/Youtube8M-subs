00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
learned a lot of the moves from the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.429 
learned a lot of the moves from the
website<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.580> perform<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.000> floor

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
website that you can perform on floor

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.750 
website that you can perform on floor
now<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.650> time<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> keep<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.310> things<00:00:20.550> in

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
now it's time to keep these things in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
now it's time to keep these things in
mind<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.710> keep<00:00:22.859> in

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
mind so the first thing is to keep in

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.599 
mind so the first thing is to keep in
mind<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.869> when<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.199> any<00:00:25.560> move<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.519> he

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
mind is when you do any move when he

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.580 
mind is when you do any move when he
starts<00:00:27.029> any<00:00:27.269> move<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> floor<00:00:28.140> cuz<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> lot

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
starts any move on the floor cuz a lot

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.929 
starts any move on the floor cuz a lot
of<00:00:28.619> times<00:00:28.710> you're<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.010> oh<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.730> down

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
of times you're like oh I can get down

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.679 
of times you're like oh I can get down

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
and do this

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.540 
and do this
I<00:00:30.720> always<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.619> also<00:00:32.009> about<00:00:32.309> how<00:00:32.399> you're

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
I always think also about how you're

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
I always think also about how you're
gonna<00:00:32.640> come<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:34.160> grace<00:00:35.160> is

gonna come out of it because grace is

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.670 
gonna come out of it because grace is
important<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> comes<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> forward<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
important when it comes to forward you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.020 
important when it comes to forward you
don't<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.100> anything<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.850> just

it like alright I did this thing this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 
it like alright I did this thing this
thing<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.469> everything<00:00:46.469> above<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
thing and then everything above it and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.090 
thing and then everything above it and
then<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.460> next<00:00:48.210> move<00:00:48.510> no<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
then now next move no we want to be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
then now next move no we want to be
graceful<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.700> entire<00:00:51.180> series<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.140> moves

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
graceful the entire series of this moves

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.619 
graceful the entire series of this moves
the<00:00:52.530> entire<00:00:52.649> time<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the entire time so think about how you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
the entire time so think about how you
gracefully<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.469> start<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> move<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
gracefully can start a move and how you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
gracefully can start a move and how you
can<00:00:56.940> gracefully<00:00:57.270> come<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.260> move<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.590> how

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
can gracefully come as the move and how

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.590 
can gracefully come as the move and how
you<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.250> transition<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> next<00:01:00.180> move<00:01:00.420> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you will transition to the next move so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.400 
you will transition to the next move so
that's<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:00.989> key

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that's really key

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
that's really key
the<00:01:01.649> second<00:01:01.949> thing<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> times<00:01:03.090> we

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the second thing is a lot of times we

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
the second thing is a lot of times we
need<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.480> practicing<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.110> moves<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> can

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
thing to keep in mind when learning

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
thing to keep in mind when learning
forward<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.460> forward<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.240> has<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> lot

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
forward is that forward with has a lot

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.399 
forward is that forward with has a lot
more<00:01:24.840> strength<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:25.830> other<00:01:27.140> types<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
more strength than other types of that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.899 
more strength than other types of that
again<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.520> such<00:01:29.759> as

wouldn't you do normally I'm trying to
think<00:03:05.920> about<00:03:06.130> how<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> put<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:07.450> right

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
think about how to put this the right

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.960 
think about how to put this the right
way<00:03:07.810> when<00:03:08.530> you're<00:03:08.709> doing<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.190> normally<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
way when you're doing it normally the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.030 
way when you're doing it normally the
flow<00:03:10.300> is<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.720> important<00:03:11.290> maybe<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:11.769> any

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
flow is so important maybe then any

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.680 
flow is so important maybe then any
other<00:03:12.100> part<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.549> values<00:03:12.880> we<00:03:13.090> don't<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.570> know

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
other part of values we don't you know

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.390 
other part of values we don't you know
how<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.900> moods<00:03:14.470> flow<00:03:14.709> together<00:03:14.920> how<00:03:15.250> they

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
how the moods flow together how they

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.600 
how the moods flow together how they
connect<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.790> get<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.930> crucial<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.070> do

could you and the chances are going to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.180

series of moves no matter what kind of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.220 
series of moves no matter what kind of
music<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.680> listen<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.100> because<00:03:30.870> most<00:03:31.870> for

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
music you listen to because most for

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.910 
music you listen to because most for
music<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.070> slow<00:03:33.400> steady<00:03:34.110> beat<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.709> we

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
music is slow steady beat you know we

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.310 
music is slow steady beat you know we
never<00:03:36.340> really<00:03:36.459> changes<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.600> much<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.079> mean<00:03:38.109> it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
never really changes that much I mean it

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.460 
never really changes that much I mean it
could<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.609> not<00:03:39.880> very<00:03:40.600> common<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.350> it

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
could but it's not very common to do it

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.970 
could but it's not very common to do it
too<00:03:41.620> fast<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.600> songs<00:03:43.600> or<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.620> song<00:03:44.950> that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
too fast the songs or to a song that

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.340 
too fast the songs or to a song that
changes<00:03:45.820> all<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:45.970> time<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.480> just<00:03:46.750> I'd<00:03:47.170> be

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
changes all the time so just I'd be

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.750 
changes all the time so just I'd be
doing<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.620> something<00:03:47.950> slow<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.340> steady<00:03:48.519> which

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
doing to something slow and steady which

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.280 
doing to something slow and steady which
means<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.120> can<00:03:49.239> do<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.450> same<00:03:49.660> series<00:03:50.109> of

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
means you can do the same series of

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.800 
means you can do the same series of
movements<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.190> same<00:03:51.400> routine<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.420> different

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
movements and same routine to different

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.770 
movements and same routine to different
types<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.170> songs<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.709> make<00:03:53.859> sure<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.100> learn<00:03:54.370> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
types of songs so make sure you learn a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.449 
types of songs so make sure you learn a
series<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.810> movements<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.560> series<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.010> combos

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
series of movements a series of combos

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.610 
series of movements a series of combos
that<00:03:57.670> are<00:03:57.760> unique<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.530> you

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
that are unique to you and that you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.009 
that are unique to you and that you
already<00:03:59.829> thought<00:04:00.280> very<00:04:01.090> well<00:04:01.239> about<00:04:01.750> how<00:04:01.900> they

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
already thought very well about how they

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.930 
already thought very well about how they
all<00:04:02.170> connect<00:04:02.530> together<00:04:02.650> how<00:04:03.040> they<00:04:03.160> start<00:04:03.489> how

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
all connect together how they start how

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.300 
all connect together how they start how
they<00:04:04.090> connect<00:04:04.680> through<00:04:05.680> media<00:04:06.010> like<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.160> don't

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
they connect through media like I don't

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.979 
they connect through media like I don't
know<00:04:06.430> five<00:04:06.640> six<00:04:06.940> seven<00:04:07.269> eight<00:04:07.450> counts<00:04:07.930> of

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
know five six seven eight counts of

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.960 
know five six seven eight counts of
eight<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.410> then<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.280> also<00:04:09.459> taught<00:04:09.760> her<00:04:09.880> how

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
eight and then you also taught her how

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.260 
eight and then you also taught her how
to<00:04:10.150> come<00:04:10.510> up<00:04:10.750> from<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:11.560> and

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
to come up from it and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.570 
to come up from it and
transition<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.560> imposition<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.490> you

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
transition just in the imposition so you

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.670 
transition just in the imposition so you
thought<00:04:14.760> about<00:04:14.850> all<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.570> stuff<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.260> then

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
thought about all that stuff and then

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.010 
thought about all that stuff and then
you<00:04:16.830> can<00:04:17.010> use<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.340> same<00:04:17.610> routine<00:04:18.570> all<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
you can use that same routine all the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.900 
you can use that same routine all the
time<00:04:19.200> whenever<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.650> do<00:04:19.770> for<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.520> can<00:04:20.670> change

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
time whenever you do for you can change

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.940 
time whenever you do for you can change
