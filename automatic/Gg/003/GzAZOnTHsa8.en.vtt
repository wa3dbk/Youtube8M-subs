hi<00:00:00.599> I'm<00:00:01.380> Steve<00:00:01.740> Jones<00:00:01.979> and<00:00:02.220> I'm<00:00:02.370> going<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.730> tell

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.499 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell
you<00:00:03.149> what<00:00:03.629> an<00:00:03.870> electrical<00:00:04.620> inverter<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.700> well

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
you what an electrical inverter is well

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.040 
you what an electrical inverter is well
first<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.290> all<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.210> understand<00:00:09.990> that

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
first of all we have to understand that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.890 
first of all we have to understand that
is<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.440> fact<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.769> opposite<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:12.179> rectifier

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
is in fact the opposite of a rectifier

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.350 
is in fact the opposite of a rectifier
and<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.219> opposite<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> thing<00:00:15.330> that

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and it is the opposite to the thing that

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.050 
and it is the opposite to the thing that
you<00:00:15.660> usually<00:00:15.929> use<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.400> example<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:17.940> you

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
you usually use so for example if you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
you usually use so for example if you
plug<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:18.690> computer<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> little

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
plug in your computer you have a little

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.390 
plug in your computer you have a little
black<00:00:20.460> box<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.740> rectifies<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
black box and this rectifies the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
black box and this rectifies the
alternating<00:00:24.000> current<00:00:24.180> from<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> mains<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
alternating current from the mains and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.160 
alternating current from the mains and
makes<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.189> into<00:00:26.490> direct<00:00:27.269> current<00:00:27.510> like

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
makes it into direct current like

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
makes it into direct current like
battery<00:00:28.769> current<00:00:29.269> but<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.480> happens<00:00:30.900> when

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
battery current but what happens when

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
battery current but what happens when
you<00:00:31.170> want<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> opposite<00:00:32.270> you've<00:00:33.270> got

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you want to do the opposite you've got

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
you want to do the opposite you've got
your<00:00:33.660> laptop<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> run<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> from

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
your laptop and you want to run it from

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.619 
your laptop and you want to run it from
the<00:00:35.489> car<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> car<00:00:36.780> battery<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:38.090> 12<00:00:39.090> volts

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the car but the car battery is 12 volts

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.180 
the car but the car battery is 12 volts
DC<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> 12<00:00:41.940> volts<00:00:42.300> DC<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:43.320> example<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> car

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
DC so 12 volts DC for example a car

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
DC so 12 volts DC for example a car
battery<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> very<00:00:47.520> important<00:00:48.180> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
battery so this is very important you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.979 
battery so this is very important you
want<00:00:49.129> from<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> 12-volt<00:00:50.910> car<00:00:51.180> battery<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
want from this 12-volt car battery you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.869 
want from this 12-volt car battery you
want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.340> alternating<00:00:54.329> current<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
want to get an alternating current like

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.139 
want to get an alternating current like
240<00:00:56.879> volt<00:00:57.090> mains<00:00:57.570> current<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.699> easy

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
240 volt mains current and it's not easy

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.729 
240 volt mains current and it's not easy
in<00:01:00.980> fact<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:03.030> create<00:01:03.359> alternating<00:01:04.320> current

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
in fact to create alternating current

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.429 
in fact to create alternating current
from<00:01:05.309> direct<00:01:05.939> current<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.960> difficult

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
from direct current is very difficult

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.120 
from direct current is very difficult
but<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.060> electrical<00:01:09.750> inverter<00:01:10.110> does<00:01:10.650> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
but the electrical inverter does that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.899 
but the electrical inverter does that
job<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.960> fact<00:01:13.470> using<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:15.049> combination<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
job you in fact using a combination of

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
job you in fact using a combination of
capacitors<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.090> inductors<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.650> build

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
capacitors and inductors you can build

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.149 
capacitors and inductors you can build
up<00:01:20.130> voltage<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> voltage

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
up voltage and make the voltage

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.530 
up voltage and make the voltage
alternate<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.729> make<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> current<00:01:24.299> go

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
alternate that is make the current go

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
alternate that is make the current go
backwards<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> forwards<00:01:25.650> instead<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.369> going

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
backwards and forwards instead of going

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.539 
backwards and forwards instead of going
always<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.299> same<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.040> actual<00:01:29.369> way

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
always the same way now the actual way

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.450 
always the same way now the actual way
it<00:01:29.610> does<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:30.600> complex<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.920> let's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it does this is very complex but let's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
it does this is very complex but let's
look<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> result<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.740> what<00:01:34.740> you're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
look at the result of it what you're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.880 
look at the result of it what you're
able<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.880> take<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.350> direct

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
able to do is take what is direct

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.370 
able to do is take what is direct
current<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.060> current<00:01:39.420> flowing<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
current that is current flowing all in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.460 
current that is current flowing all in
one<00:01:40.530> direction<00:01:41.060> into<00:01:42.060> alternating<00:01:42.630> current

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
one direction into alternating current

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.149 
one direction into alternating current
going<00:01:43.860> backwards<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> forwards<00:01:45.649> just<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
going backwards and forwards just as in

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.690 
going backwards and forwards just as in
the<00:01:47.310> mains<00:01:48.200> typically<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.430> want

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the mains typically you would want

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.440 
the mains typically you would want
something<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.799> 250<00:01:53.180> volts<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.729> 250<00:01:56.729> watts

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
something like 250 volts and 250 watts

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.819 
something like 250 volts and 250 watts
of<00:01:58.159> power<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.090> 250<00:02:00.990> watts<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
of power if you can get 250 watts you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.639 
of power if you can get 250 watts you
can<00:02:02.100> run<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> laptop<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.750> run<00:02:03.960> lights

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
can run the laptop you can run lights

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.570 
can run the laptop you can run lights
and<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.549> forth<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.770> basically<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.069> electrical

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and so forth so basically the electrical

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.300 
and so forth so basically the electrical
inverter<00:02:09.140> enables<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.619> use<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.550> 12<00:02:12.420> volt<00:02:12.750> or

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
inverter enables you to use a 12 volt or

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.210 
inverter enables you to use a 12 volt or
