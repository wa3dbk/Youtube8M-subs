wait so you're telling me that black ops
2<00:00:03.210> just<00:00:03.510> came<00:00:03.750> out<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:04.319> want<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.650> rundown

2 just came out and you want the rundown

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.800 
2 just came out and you want the rundown
on<00:00:05.069> all<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.609> SMGs<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.359> order<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.660> appearance

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
on all the SMGs in order of appearance

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.690 
on all the SMGs in order of appearance
and<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.620> me<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.770> give<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.099> opinions<00:00:08.580> on

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
and for me to give you my opinions on

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.040 
and for me to give you my opinions on
all<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.000> them<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.450> tell<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.690> which<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:10.019> I

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
all of them and to tell you which one I

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
all of them and to tell you which one I
think<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> best<00:00:11.509> okay<00:00:15.529> first<00:00:16.529> off<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.949> have

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
think is the best okay first off we have

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.529 
think is the best okay first off we have
the<00:00:17.190> mp7<00:00:17.570> it<00:00:18.570> has<00:00:18.779> moderate<00:00:19.470> recoil<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.539> fire

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the mp7 it has moderate recoil and fire

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.179 
the mp7 it has moderate recoil and fire
rate<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.730> clip<00:00:23.730> size<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.930> uh<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.800> pretty

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
rate and clip size it's uh it's pretty

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.400 
rate and clip size it's uh it's pretty
much<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.939> run-of-the-mill<00:00:27.300> SMG<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
much the run-of-the-mill SMG of the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
much the run-of-the-mill SMG of the
group<00:00:28.619> certainly<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> best<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.480> my

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
group certainly not the best in my

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
group certainly not the best in my
opinion<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.590> won't<00:00:31.769> find<00:00:31.859> yourself<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
opinion but you won't find yourself as a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.510 
opinion but you won't find yourself as a
disadvantage<00:00:33.270> early<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.780> against<00:00:34.680> other<00:00:34.890> SMGs

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
disadvantage early on against other SMGs

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
disadvantage early on against other SMGs
I<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> might<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> popular

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
I also think it might be a popular

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950 
I also think it might be a popular
choice<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.450> being<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.719> fan

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
choice because of it being a fan

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.770 
choice because of it being a fan
favorite<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.440> modern<00:00:40.800> warfare<00:00:40.950> 3<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.059> look<00:00:42.600> for

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
favorite in modern warfare 3 so look for

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
favorite in modern warfare 3 so look for
a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> people<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.530> using<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.100> there

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a lot of people to be using it but there

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.980 
a lot of people to be using it but there
are<00:00:44.579> definitely<00:00:45.000> better<00:00:45.329> choices<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.989> there

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.500 

next<00:00:51.990> we<00:00:52.080> have<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> pdw-57<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.850> has<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.150> large

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
next we have the pdw-57 it has a large

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
next we have the pdw-57 it has a large
clip<00:00:54.930> size<00:00:55.140> moderate<00:00:55.800> recoil<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:56.370> awesome

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
clip size moderate recoil and awesome

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
clip size moderate recoil and awesome
iron<00:00:57.360> sights<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.860> definitely<00:00:59.400> going<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
iron sights this is definitely going to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.770 
iron sights this is definitely going to
be<00:00:59.700> one<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.880> you're<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.450> want<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> put

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
be one that you're going to want to put

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170 
be one that you're going to want to put
some<00:01:00.930> effort<00:01:01.050> into<00:01:01.380> early<00:01:01.830> on<00:01:01.980> 50<00:01:02.760> rounds

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
some effort into early on 50 rounds

standard<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.080> similar<00:01:04.500> damage<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> mp7

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
standard with similar damage to the mp7

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.820 
standard with similar damage to the mp7
makes<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.210> almost<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.720> no<00:01:06.960> contest<00:01:07.500> winner

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830

it<00:02:03.950> feel<00:02:04.219> like<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.460> select<00:02:04.939> fire<00:02:05.149> attachment

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
it feel like the select fire attachment

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.050 
it feel like the select fire attachment
is<00:02:05.929> built<00:02:06.229> right<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.679> it's<00:02:07.310> very<00:02:07.549> hard<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.880> get

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060

used<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.750> at<00:02:09.080> first<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.530> didn't<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:10.039> at

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
used to and at first I didn't like it at

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.339 
used to and at first I didn't like it at
all<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:11.300> ends<00:02:12.019> up<00:02:12.080> being<00:02:12.260> very

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
all but it's ends up being very

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.350 
all but it's ends up being very
versatile<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.819> different<00:02:14.180> situations

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360
