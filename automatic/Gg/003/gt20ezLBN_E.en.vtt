I<00:02:45.109> started<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:46.010> build<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.519> with<00:02:47.359> a<00:02:47.390> friends

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810

out<00:02:54.980> right<00:02:55.519> there<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.510> ended<00:02:57.109> up

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
out right there and so I ended up

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.699 
out right there and so I ended up
digging<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.930> foundation<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.260> corners

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
digging the foundation just the corners

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.559 
digging the foundation just the corners
and<00:03:00.920> then<00:03:01.040> pouring<00:03:01.459> concrete<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.120> set<00:03:02.299> it<00:03:02.420> on

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
and then pouring concrete and set it on

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:03.910 
and then pouring concrete and set it on
there<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.840> then<00:03:02.900> building<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.319> foundation

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
there and then building the foundation

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.210 
there and then building the foundation
out<00:03:04.040> through<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.370> bottom<00:03:04.750> now<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.109> are

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
out through the bottom now here we are

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.470 
out through the bottom now here we are
initially<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.850> day<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.180> started

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
initially I think the day that I started

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.080 
initially I think the day that I started
to<00:03:08.780> build<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.170> grow<00:03:09.350> bed<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:09.980> first<00:03:10.790> lined

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to build the grow bed and I first lined

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.920 
to build the grow bed and I first lined
it<00:03:11.329> with<00:03:11.359> some<00:03:11.600> cedar<00:03:13.239> shavings<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.780> then

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
it with some cedar shavings and then

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.140 
it with some cedar shavings and then
there's<00:03:15.139> the<00:03:15.319> hundred<00:03:15.590> fifty<00:03:15.829> gallon<00:03:16.220> stock

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
there's the hundred fifty gallon stock

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.289 
there's the hundred fifty gallon stock
tank<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.720> used<00:03:18.639> here<00:03:19.639> we<00:03:19.730> are<00:03:19.760> getting<00:03:20.030> to

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
tank that I used here we are getting to

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.309

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
build the grow bed there's the base that

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.110 
build the grow bed there's the base that
I<00:03:24.350> used<00:03:24.590> two<00:03:24.859> by<00:03:25.040> fours<00:03:26.950> twelve<00:03:27.950> 16-inch<00:03:28.579> studs

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.300 
I used two by fours twelve 16-inch studs
on<00:03:29.540> stud<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:30.049> where<00:03:30.200> how<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.410> ended<00:03:30.680> up<00:03:30.769> doing<00:03:30.980> it

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
on stud is where how I ended up doing it

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.900 
on stud is where how I ended up doing it
I<00:03:31.519> use<00:03:32.560> two<00:03:33.560> by<00:03:33.709> sixes<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.430> way<00:03:34.519> around

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
I use two by sixes all the way around

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.449 
I use two by sixes all the way around
and<00:03:35.269> then<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.350> two<00:03:36.500> by<00:03:36.650> fours<00:03:36.889> on<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> bottom

to hold that in place to where I could

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.490 
to hold that in place to where I could
make<00:04:45.070> it<00:04:45.220> movable<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.360> could<00:04:46.690> ensure<00:04:47.229> that<00:04:47.380> I

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
make it movable so I could ensure that I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.070

tried a Miller brand little giant and it

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.439 
tried a Miller brand little giant and it
just<00:05:44.680> wasn't<00:05:44.979> gonna<00:05:45.070> hold<00:05:45.340> up<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.790> so<00:05:46.210> that's
