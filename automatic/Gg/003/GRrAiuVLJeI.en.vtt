iPhone can survive a 15-foot free fall
to<00:01:40.170> concrete<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
to concrete now I have it here the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.929 
to concrete now I have it here the
students<00:01:43.740> why<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.100> does<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
students why how does it do this and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.719 
students why how does it do this and
basically<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.520> comes

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
basically what you see here is it comes

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.420 
basically what you see here is it comes
in<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:47.880> colors<00:01:48.240> black<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> red<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.430> affords

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
in two colors black and red it affords

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
in two colors black and red it affords
five<00:01:50.790> layers<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.509> protection<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.530> going

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
five layers of protection and I'm going

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.080 
five layers of protection and I'm going
to<00:01:52.740> take<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.009> iPhone<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.430> show<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.729> basically

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to take my iPhone and show you basically

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
to take my iPhone and show you basically
how<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.329> works<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.860> first<00:01:56.100> layer<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.640> hard

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
how it works the first layer is a hard

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.830 
how it works the first layer is a hard
case<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.810> done<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.219> hard<00:02:00.180> plastic<00:02:00.390> but

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
case that's done in a hard plastic but

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.920 
case that's done in a hard plastic but
it<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.110> also<00:02:01.320> an<00:02:01.850> inside<00:02:02.850> layer<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.540> what

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it is also an inside layer that is what

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
it is also an inside layer that is what
happens<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.040> there's<00:02:05.670> an

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
happens if you do it right there's an

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.780 
happens if you do it right there's an
inner<00:02:06.000> layer<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
inner layer that

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.660 
inner layer that
has<00:02:07.420> soft<00:02:07.840> silicone<00:02:08.410> inside<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.430> can

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
has soft silicone inside so you can

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.080 
has soft silicone inside so you can
actually<00:02:09.880> use<00:02:10.270> just<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.930> way<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.790> hold

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
actually use just this way to to hold

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.790 
actually use just this way to to hold
the<00:02:13.270> iphone<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.040> look<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.750> basically<00:02:16.800> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
the iphone and look and basically you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.530 
the iphone and look and basically you
use<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.850> doesn't<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.210> make<00:02:19.480> it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
use it and it doesn't really make it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.500 
use it and it doesn't really make it
that<00:02:19.780> much<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:20.020> difficult<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.280> handle<00:02:21.700> but

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
that much more difficult to handle but

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.900 
that much more difficult to handle but
does<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.050> affect<00:02:23.380> touchscreen<00:02:24.100> opera<00:02:24.460> at<00:02:24.790> all

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
does it affect touchscreen opera at all

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.550 
does it affect touchscreen opera at all
i<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.420> say<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.200> my<00:02:26.290> most

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
i have to say that was one of my most

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.190 
i have to say that was one of my most
pleasant<00:02:27.490> surprises<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.510> protective<00:02:28.960> screen

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
pleasant surprises the protective screen

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.350 
pleasant surprises the protective screen
i<00:02:29.560> had<00:02:29.950> trouble<00:02:30.370> moving<00:02:30.520> from<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.940> blackberry

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
i had trouble moving from a blackberry

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.950 
i had trouble moving from a blackberry
to<00:02:31.510> an<00:02:31.600> iphone<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.400> parallax<00:02:34.360> correction

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
to an iphone the the parallax correction

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.020 
to an iphone the the parallax correction
of<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> protective<00:02:35.860> screen<00:02:35.890> actually<00:02:36.880> for

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
of the protective screen actually for

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.850 
of the protective screen actually for
some<00:02:37.210> reason<00:02:37.570> makes<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.900> easy<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.230> type<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.770> the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
some reason makes it easy to type on the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.250 
some reason makes it easy to type on the
virtual<00:02:39.220> keyboard<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.840> yeah<00:02:41.110> it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
virtual keyboard so this is yeah it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.510 
virtual keyboard so this is yeah it
actually<00:02:41.410> helped<00:02:41.830> me<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.130> course<00:02:42.160> it's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
actually helped me and of course it's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.340 
actually helped me and of course it's
got<00:02:42.670> ports<00:02:43.120> i'm<00:02:43.240> going<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.450> show<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:44.110> hard

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
got ports i'm going to show you the hard

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.050 
got ports i'm going to show you the hard
case<00:02:44.620> protects<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:45.610> where<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> really

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
case protects it but where it really

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.060 
case protects it but where it really
comes<00:02:46.390> into<00:02:46.630> its<00:02:46.750> own<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.230> has<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> silicone

outer case if you're going to use it if
you<00:02:50.110> work<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.440> an<00:02:50.530> industry<00:02:50.680> like

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you work in an industry like

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.770 
you work in an industry like
construction<00:02:52.060> or<00:02:52.150> whatnot<00:02:52.330> where<00:02:52.690> it's

likely that you might drop your iphone
what<00:02:55.090> happens<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.630> slip<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.080> out<00:02:56.560> of

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
what happens is you slip this out of

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.070 
what happens is you slip this out of
case<00:02:57.040> over<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.820> what<00:02:58.209> happens<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.900> has

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
case over it and what happens is it has

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.740 
case over it and what happens is it has
ports<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.550> actually<00:03:00.910> covered<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
ports in it that actually covered the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.400 
ports in it that actually covered the
plugs<00:03:02.280> where<00:03:03.280> dirt<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.330> grime<00:03:04.600> particularly

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
plugs where dirt and grime particularly

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.250 
plugs where dirt and grime particularly
the<00:03:05.880> docking<00:03:06.880> connector<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.540> plugs<00:03:08.080> that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
the docking connector it plugs that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.560 
the docking connector it plugs that
plugs<00:03:08.770> everything<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.850> what<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.180> wind<00:03:10.390> up

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
plugs everything so what you wind up

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.509 
plugs everything so what you wind up
with<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.470> also<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.890> tends<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.220> make<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
with is and also it tends to make it

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.640 
with is and also it tends to make it
fall<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.060> way<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.760> all<00:03:16.239> those<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.410> that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
fall this way so if all those like that

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.070 
fall this way so if all those like that
now<00:03:17.980> there's<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.700> belt<00:03:19.030> clip<00:03:19.150> which<00:03:19.870> is

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
now there's a belt clip which is

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.530 
now there's a belt clip which is
designed<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.739> hold<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.550> this<00:03:21.700> soft

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
designed to hold it so that this soft

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.500 
designed to hold it so that this soft
outer<00:03:23.190> surface<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.430> facing<00:03:24.820> out<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:24.970> it's<00:03:25.390> on

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
outer surface is facing out so it's on

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.180 
outer surface is facing out so it's on
your<00:03:25.660> belt<00:03:25.900> if<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.170> bump<00:03:26.410> into<00:03:26.560> things<00:03:26.680> if<00:03:27.070> it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
your belt if you bump into things if it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.520 
your belt if you bump into things if it
does<00:03:27.370> fall<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> ground<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.630> really<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.230> you

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
does fall on the ground it really as you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.440 
does fall on the ground it really as you
saw<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> tape<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.370> well<00:03:30.640> protected<00:03:30.850> both

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
saw on the tape it's well protected both

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.320 
saw on the tape it's well protected both
from<00:03:31.810> impact<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.920> from<00:03:33.310> dirt<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.730> grime<00:03:33.910> so

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
from impact and from dirt and grime so

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.770 
from impact and from dirt and grime so
the<00:03:34.750> cost<00:03:35.049> is<00:03:35.410> roughly<00:03:36.070> is<00:03:36.519> 4995<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.690> is

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the cost is roughly is 4995 this is

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.509 
the cost is roughly is 4995 this is
called<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.110> HC<00:03:38.590> model<00:03:38.980> they<00:03:39.070> make<00:03:39.130> another

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
called the HC model they make another

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.940 
called the HC model they make another
one<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:40.269> isn't<00:03:40.510> quite<00:03:40.810> as<00:03:41.080> bulky<00:03:41.560> which<00:03:41.769> is

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
one that isn't quite as bulky which is

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.430 
one that isn't quite as bulky which is
3495<00:03:42.880> but<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.510> thought<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.930> coolest<00:03:44.290> thing

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
3495 but I thought the coolest thing

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.930 
3495 but I thought the coolest thing
about<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> lot<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.400> people<00:03:45.519> see<00:03:45.790> this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
about it is and a lot of people see this

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.789 
about it is and a lot of people see this
and<00:03:46.120> say<00:03:46.269> god<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.780> kind<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.380> big<00:03:47.769> and

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
and say god this is kind of big and

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.920 
and say god this is kind of big and
bulky<00:03:48.130> but<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.880> don't<00:03:49.090> really<00:03:49.239> need<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.690> have

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
bulky but you don't really need to have

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.130 
bulky but you don't really need to have
the<00:03:50.140> outer<00:03:51.150> less<00:03:52.150> during<00:03:52.390> construction<00:03:52.660> or

the outer less during construction or
right<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.680> heavy<00:03:54.280> duty<00:03:54.610> line<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.060> work

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
right and the heavy duty line of work

right and the heavy duty line of work
and<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.570> clip<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.410> belt<00:03:56.620> clip<00:03:56.860> on<00:03:57.040> is

say still offers you really good

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.560 
say still offers you really good
protection<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:02.799> bear<00:04:03.489> in<00:04:03.519> mind<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.239> you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
protection so bear in mind that the you

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.750 
protection so bear in mind that the you
know<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.780> iphone<00:04:05.230> glass<00:04:05.860> constructionist

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
know the iphone glass constructionist

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.030 
know the iphone glass constructionist
has<00:04:07.030> fallen<00:04:07.510> into<00:04:07.780> some<00:04:07.959> controversy<00:04:08.620> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
has fallen into some controversy the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.509 
has fallen into some controversy the
material<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:09.670> called<00:04:10.230> aluminosilicate<00:04:11.230> and

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
material is called aluminosilicate and

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.610 
material is called aluminosilicate and
it's<00:04:12.519> supposedly<00:04:12.940> 30<00:04:13.360> times<00:04:13.660> harder<00:04:14.410> than

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
it's supposedly 30 times harder than

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.920 
it's supposedly 30 times harder than
plastic<00:04:15.340> but<00:04:16.060> i<00:04:16.090> know<00:04:16.180> here<00:04:16.540> at<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.690> station

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
plastic but i know here at the station

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.729 
plastic but i know here at the station
several<00:04:17.440> people<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.859> have<00:04:17.980> had<00:04:18.280> their

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
several people that have had their

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.589 
several people that have had their
shatter<00:04:19.220> when<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.609> fell<00:04:19.789> on<00:04:19.819> the<00:04:20.000> concrete<00:04:20.359> so

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
shatter when it fell on the concrete so

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.020 
shatter when it fell on the concrete so
it's<00:04:20.780> almost<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.620> good<00:04:22.039> idea<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.580> invest<00:04:22.819> in

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
it's almost a good idea to invest in

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.180 
it's almost a good idea to invest in
some<00:04:23.270> kind<00:04:23.479> of<00:04:23.539> case<00:04:23.780> cases<00:04:24.470> range<00:04:24.919> from

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
some kind of case cases range from

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.100 
some kind of case cases range from
little<00:04:25.550> soft<00:04:25.880> cases<00:04:26.150> like<00:04:26.449> this<00:04:26.599> which<00:04:26.840> really

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
little soft cases like this which really

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.200 
little soft cases like this which really
I<00:04:27.199> don't<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:28.039> know<00:04:28.130> what<00:04:28.370> how<00:04:29.030> much

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
I don't know you know what how much

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.360 
I don't know you know what how much
protection<00:04:29.419> they<00:04:29.810> afford<00:04:30.139> but<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.190> know<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
protection they afford but you know the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.339 
protection they afford but you know the
replacement<00:04:31.910> cost<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.300> an<00:04:32.389> iphone<00:04:32.509> is<00:04:32.900> 600

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
replacement cost of an iphone is 600

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.080 
replacement cost of an iphone is 600
bucks<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:33.830> basically<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.490> you're<00:04:34.639> worried<00:04:34.880> if

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
bucks so basically if you're worried if

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.309 
bucks so basically if you're worried if
you're<00:04:35.210> any<00:04:35.360> kind<00:04:35.419> of<00:04:35.569> situation<00:04:35.690> or<00:04:36.139> you<00:04:36.199> just

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
you're any kind of situation or you just

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.309 
you're any kind of situation or you just
prone<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.740> drop<00:04:37.009> things<00:04:37.310> like<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.789> am<00:04:38.319> investing

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
prone to drop things like I am investing

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.290 
prone to drop things like I am investing
in<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.500> case<00:04:39.710> like<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.099> ballistic<00:04:40.580> HC<00:04:41.000> or<00:04:41.210> the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
in a case like the ballistic HC or the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.659 
in a case like the ballistic HC or the
ballistic<00:04:41.660> SG<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.500> less<00:04:42.650> bulky<00:04:43.009> version<00:04:43.550> is

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
ballistic SG the less bulky version is

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.640 
ballistic SG the less bulky version is
probably<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.449> good<00:04:44.509> idea<00:04:44.750> all<00:04:45.199> right<00:04:45.410> Jerry

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
probably a good idea all right Jerry

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.890 
probably a good idea all right Jerry
