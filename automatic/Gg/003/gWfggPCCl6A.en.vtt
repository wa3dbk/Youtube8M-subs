decision-making skills that we have in
the<00:05:47.420> habits<00:05:47.840> that<00:05:47.930> we've<00:05:48.170> developed

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
the habits that we've developed

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.150 
the habits that we've developed
continues<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:50.180> create<00:05:50.840> disharmony<00:05:51.290> in<00:05:51.830> our

continues to create disharmony in our
being<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:53.200> so<00:05:54.200> we're<00:05:54.590> trying<00:05:54.620> to<00:05:54.980> get<00:05:55.220> into

power working through us when we lighten
up<00:06:21.080> our<00:06:21.530> foods<00:06:22.070> we<00:06:22.520> go<00:06:22.820> to<00:06:22.880> the<00:06:23.270> raw<00:06:23.480> food<00:06:23.840> we<00:06:24.260> go

up our foods we go to the raw food we go

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.320 
up our foods we go to the raw food we go

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
to like the vegetarian and then we go to

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.020 
to like the vegetarian and then we go to
the<00:06:26.510> vegan<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.260> then<00:06:27.710> we<00:06:27.920> go<00:06:28.100> to<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.730> raw

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
then we go to

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.710 
then we go to
juices<00:06:34.560> and<00:06:34.889> then<00:06:35.400> where<00:06:35.759> we<00:06:35.910> go<00:06:36.060> beyond<00:06:36.419> their
