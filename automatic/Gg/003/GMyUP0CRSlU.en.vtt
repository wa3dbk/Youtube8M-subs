00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.800
 pixelated cubic minecraft world amor 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 brimming with imagination with a 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.100
 population of more than 100 million 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.069
 registered players 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.350
 wow it's a lot of Greek people and 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.670
 you do you here style years and well 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.430
 today I had shown to all the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 world how to make a hidden chest 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 and I think it's even one of the most 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 effective so far is one of 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.560
 easier than I did until date 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:45.570
 oh yeah it's beautiful all that but with or 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.060
 without stockings it is youth corrupted by 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.039
 kraft is an extremely dangerous world 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.830
 and sometimes interesting to hide these 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:58.330
 precious objects flying tettey 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.430
 you here your voice is so sexy 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.040
 could maybe introduce this tutorial 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.250
 amplified demand too easy to achieve 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.050
 this drop touches the page I have nothing 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.220
 of expected today this world looks to me 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.110
 quite nice 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.470
 on the other hand you will have to teach me 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.650
 how to do no problem 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.070
 excellent so hang on it's 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.070
 left 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.360
 we have traveled a number 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.739
 countless blocks cross 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.660
 forest deserts blizzards 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.420
 face monsters of all kinds 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.930
 my learning was arduous and sprinkled 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 with obstacles 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.440
 yet I was told that I did not have 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.940
 still hit the red stone or that there 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.130
 had even more dangerous worlds 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 what will become of me here 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.600
 yet I will not put a little too much there 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.720
 by chance 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.010
 well yeah but it must be ban s 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.480
 interested anyway I think you're 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.310
 ready, let's go 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.599
 good then you're hot potato because 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 that for starters you have to find 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.690
 a source of natural avs in 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 surfaces or in caves 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.410
 you can also make a lake 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.120
 artificial lava but that's for the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.819
 guys who do not laugh today we do 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 in ease and speed 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.489
 so once you have found a 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.459
 lake from there you have to jump in 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.230
 weight but what you would come to his 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 will she put what is right for 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.700
 I'm kidding but I know that there are 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.709
 people who could do it and after we 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.489
 would have a wave of rage in the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.440
 comments good joke truce 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.130
 a fake lake you have to find a corner 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.450
 like that in this angle or so like 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.430
 it's like that or it's good 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.750
 ok we understood I believe in quay 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.180
 choose your corner place yourself as 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.489
 that then dug a hole of three blocks to 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.870
 side dug then steps for 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.670
 be able to get out quickly case 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.470
 of lava flow effectively and 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.329
 you're going to have to prepare a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.570
 talent in your inventory 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.060
 it could then happen two things in 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.070
 breaking up is blocking the lava has already 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.709
 started to flow because the lake is 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.500
 deep so lay your slab was pulling 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.870
 quickly to avoid flaming otherwise 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 you're going to have to break the block he 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.350
 obstructs and waits for lava to flow 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.730
 and then you ask your talent 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.660
 prepare a chest then break the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.430
 block below the slab 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.410
 then put down your chest but 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.190
 and to your a little trunk and not take it 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.160
 fire but maker the chest they wooden yes 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.620
 these costs actually but logical to 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.340
 minecraft is not to understand the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.220
 kingdom and cork 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.440
 so now i'm going to show you if 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.479
 you want to make a double safe it's 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.490
 super simple dig a little more in the 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.560
 opposite direction of lava 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.270
 then put your chest to make 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.490
 a double safe and do not forget to 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.900
 digging just above to prevent 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.410
 Corsican is not it 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.210
 obstructed 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.190
 obviously there is in there you do 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.340
 like for the first chest and you 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.910
 place a slab just above it 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.490
 already finished 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.590
 almost ah yeah that's right remember 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.310
 not to close everything and neither seen nor known 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.840
 and yeah that's it, I'll need 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.220
 a little practice to grasp how 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.080
 you place open the chest 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.669
 normally you stand in front of 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.190
 your chest like that move you 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.020
 then three blocks and look in 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.610
 trunk direction click several 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.349
 times by adjusting the height until 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.750
 that you open it here you can 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.430
 also take blocks of all 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.919
 colors that are naturally around 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.210
 of the lava lake to help you spot 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.729
 the place of your chest 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.800
 I want to clarify that we could have 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.220
 also put the kof directly into the 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.840
 washed 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.090
 I thought it was way too much 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.860
 dangerous so I decided to go there 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.710
 for a slightly less risky solution 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.750
 so club how do you find this 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.430
 hiding but I think you can not 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.169
 better hide a chest no button on 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.030
 no short passage almost impossible 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.560
 to fall on it by chance but that's 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.169
 not a bit dangerous to be as no 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.389
 there the man yeah actually first 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.099
 that kind of akashat that you should quickly 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.599
 and use the night with all the 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.580
 monsters that could be at the rate 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.930
 would really be punctured because of this 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.210
 who she is who would like an arrow 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.139
 but there is a price to pay for having 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.180
 the best triggers 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.590
 yeah well I'm going to go I'm going 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.270
