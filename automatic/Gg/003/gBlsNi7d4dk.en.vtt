two

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.150 

get<00:00:46.540> rid<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.810> the<00:00:47.140> search<00:00:48.570> box<00:00:49.890> resize<00:00:50.890> widgets

resizable and this is that drawer which
and<00:00:59.320> these<00:01:00.250> two<00:01:00.490> are<00:01:00.520> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:02.739> still<00:01:03.100> in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
and these two are I think still in

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.700 
and these two are I think still in
development<00:01:03.900> at<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.590> rotate<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:08.440> we<00:01:08.560> can

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
development at of the rotate so we can

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:19.110 
development at of the rotate so we can
rotate

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.920 

and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.610 

the<00:01:22.470> next<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.630> pretty

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.240 

good<00:01:28.510> multitasking<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.840> built<00:01:30.530> five<00:01:30.890> which

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
good multitasking and built five which

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.160 
good multitasking and built five which
are<00:01:31.400> used<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.080> not<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.820> much<00:01:34.970> if<00:01:37.150> and

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
are used it is not so so so much if and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.340 
are used it is not so so so much if and
doing<00:01:39.170> camera<00:01:39.850> which<00:01:40.850> loves<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.300> bit<00:01:41.660> faster<00:01:42.140> I

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
doing camera which loves a bit faster I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.540 
doing camera which loves a bit faster I
think

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:56.700 

or<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.420> trip

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.560 

I<00:01:57.930> think

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.899 

this<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:03.100> not<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:04.140> daily<00:02:05.140> usage<00:02:05.550> which<00:02:06.550> i<00:02:06.729> use

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
this is not for daily usage which i use

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.220 
this is not for daily usage which i use
for<00:02:07.150> daily<00:02:07.540> but<00:02:07.720> not<00:02:08.470> for<00:02:08.910> always<00:02:09.910> which<00:02:10.230> it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
for daily but not for always which it

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.610 
for daily but not for always which it
can<00:02:11.560> record<00:02:12.160> videos
