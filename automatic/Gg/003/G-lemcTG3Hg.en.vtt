00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.589
 very good to everyone I'm the doc and we're 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.960
 in minecraft to see a pretty mode 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.040
 weird as you know I'm a fan of the mods 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.139
 earrings this mode was the 1.4 point 4 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.199
 although you can also download it for 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.279
 the 1.4 point 2 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.520
 but good now we are in the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:27.480
 last in 1.4 point 4 and this one adds 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:31.000
 some clay mascots of a pets 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.300
 what cookies or are we all going to learn to 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.420
 do what 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.420
 this way the head is thus 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.710
 the body was like that I think 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 yes 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 torso 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.870
 The torso is said in English 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.920
 I do not think so 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.170
 and so the feet 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.009
 now we gather everything 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.460
 and they give us the pet I'm listening to a 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.460
 zombie out there 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.830
 is given here I suppose pointed 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.230
 come on we can take advantage of him in 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.980
 reality is more let loose they defend 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.820
 the enemies where more 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.820
 they sing 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 there is a mushroom and good that gave me these 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.080
 bugs that protect the mods in addition 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.080
 this is the basic is here 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.070
 It looks like a mini warrior 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.920
 they protect you from those of the mods and we can 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.590
 do several types we can if the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.180
 we surround with arrows we will make an archer 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.600
 if we surround it with snow we do the same 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.600
 doll 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.820
 or not 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.340
 but good the postmen you have them in the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.560
 page in the link that you have it right in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 the description there you can download 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.950
 This nickname is enough is enough 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780
 interesting more the bugs follow you to 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.020
 all sides 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.820
 and with me he with warriors 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.850
 well we can do several types are 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.690
 also this the archer was throwing 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.690
 flechita these cats 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.459
 then we have this an angel 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.020
 and a demon is pretty wise besides 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.430
 when we kill them they give us this from here 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.020
 which is the broken clay mascot but 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.260
 we can also take it out as you can see 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.420
 like bruised this is the fucked up and this 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.910
 be normal has been put here just for 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.690
 that I teach you 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.690
 well we can if I put spawn 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.310
 zombie 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.760
 the crips that do not attack them can 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.299
 say it 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
 it is also important to know skeleton 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.090
 spider I do not know why they attack her two 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.090
 flus a little bit 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.840
 well now I'm not on facebook now 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.840
 Total is watching normal 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.629
 Now I have to hit him because 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.970
 clear as I am in creative do not come to 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.470
 for me but in mode your woods are going to 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.470
 if the bugs now 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.630
 they spoil hosts the art angel 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.980
 they create smacks although I think you do 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.560
 view the demon throwing away something 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.350
 fire but good not in this one but before 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.880
 doing tests but the snow I do not know 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.100
 I do not know if it's that he throws snowballs 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.400
 hey he throws something but he does not see what 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.280
 which I do not know very well 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.060
 as if you see how it has fireballs 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.060
 the demon 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.490
 and that's it 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.400
 it's very good it's very cool this 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.290
 He also added a little thing with what 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.069
 we can remove the bugs without having 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.499
 that kill them 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.969
 let more you snow 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.650
 God just could not take 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.280
 other 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.280
 but good 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.840
 for me 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.840
 and I was 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.660
 and they all go like gypsies dancing 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.660
 gypsy beating 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.770
 arrives 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.720

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.370

 point 4.2 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.720
 an army of gypsies who follow you 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.180
 and nothing to another bye 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.800
