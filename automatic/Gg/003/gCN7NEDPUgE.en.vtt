scenarios<00:01:20.889> sucks<00:01:21.460> what<00:01:22.420> these<00:01:22.840> can<00:01:23.200> do

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
scenarios sucks what these can do

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.450 
scenarios sucks what these can do
because<00:01:23.560> they<00:01:23.799> have<00:01:23.889> a<00:01:23.920> really<00:01:24.189> low

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
because they have a really low

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
right out they slide really easily so it

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.010 
right out they slide really easily so it
gets<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.700> slide<00:01:31.030> on<00:01:31.060> your<00:01:31.359> side<00:01:31.600> your<00:01:31.810> back
