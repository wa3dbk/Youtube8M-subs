hello today I'm going to discuss how to
use<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.200> crop<00:00:04.410> tool<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.799> Lightroom<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.520> use<00:00:06.390> it

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
use the crop tool in Lightroom I use it

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600 
use the crop tool in Lightroom I use it
to<00:00:06.720> tweak<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:06.990> composition<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:07.980> images<00:00:08.429> as

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
to tweak the composition of my images as

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.879 
to tweak the composition of my images as
well<00:00:08.670> as<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.150> change<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.719> aspect<00:00:09.870> ratio<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.769> my

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
well as to change the aspect ratio of my

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.980 
well as to change the aspect ratio of my
images<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.670> i<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:12.000> print<00:00:12.300> them<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.719> specific

of<00:00:59.430> interest<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> us<00:00:59.940> today<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:01.559> first<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of interest to us today the first is a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.149 
of interest to us today the first is a
drop-down<00:01:02.820> menu<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.420> aspect<00:01:03.960> ratios<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
drop-down menu of aspect ratios and the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.410 
drop-down menu of aspect ratios and the
second<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> lock<00:01:06.979> by<00:01:07.979> default<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.880> aspect

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
second is a lock by default the aspect

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.370 
second is a lock by default the aspect
ratio<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:10.110> set<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.380> original<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.380> aspect

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
ratio be set to original and the aspect

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.660 
ratio be set to original and the aspect
ratio<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:14.010> locked<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:15.270> means<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
ratio be locked this means that as I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.960 
ratio be locked this means that as I
reposition<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:18.090> side<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.920> crop<00:01:20.250> overlay

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
reposition one side of the crop overlay

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.890 
reposition one side of the crop overlay
the<00:01:21.780> other<00:01:22.049> sides<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> crop<00:01:23.520> overlay<00:01:24.210> will

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the other sides of the crop overlay will

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.350 
the other sides of the crop overlay will
resize<00:01:25.500> themselves<00:01:26.189> automatically<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
resize themselves automatically to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.560 
resize themselves automatically to
maintain<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> locked<00:01:28.610> aspect<00:01:29.610> ratio<00:01:30.119> which

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
maintain the locked aspect ratio which

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
maintain the locked aspect ratio which
in<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.960> case<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.890> aspect<00:01:32.280> ratio<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
in this case is the aspect ratio of the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.770 
in this case is the aspect ratio of the
original<00:01:33.720> image<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> free

that's<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.769> now<00:02:51.760> one<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.269> advantages<00:02:52.569> of

that's it now one of the advantages of

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.379 
that's it now one of the advantages of
using<00:02:52.959> Lightroom<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.489> all<00:02:54.670> my<00:02:54.880> edits<00:02:55.239> are

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
using Lightroom is that all my edits are

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.780 
using Lightroom is that all my edits are
non-destructive<00:02:56.109> so<00:02:56.859> if<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.069> decide<00:02:57.400> later<00:02:57.639> I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
non-destructive so if I decide later I

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.059 
non-destructive so if I decide later I
need<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.209> tweak<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.510> crop<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.139> just<00:02:59.590> open<00:02:59.980> the
