00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.391
- Have you ever had your faith

00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:04.139
in the King James Bible rattled

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:06.345
because people ask you questions

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.597
you don't have good answers for?

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.472
You know, stuff like,

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:14.850
"Which edition of the
King James is the bible?"

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.010
Look, I know the empty feeling

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.809
that you get in the pit of your stomach

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.272
when you start to think,

00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:22.234
"Hey wait, maybe I'm wrong,

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.591
"maybe the King James
isn't the right bible.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.657
"Maybe it's got errors in it."

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:29.409
And you know, that's why I set my face

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.746
to answer these and many
other tough questions

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:35.070
that the critics ask us all the time.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.485
Hi, my name is Jack McElroy.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.654
I'm an entrepreneur, a
businessman, and an author

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:44.534
but more importantly, I'm
a born again Christian

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:48.237
and a King James Bible
believer for over 25 years.

00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:51.023
Since becoming a Christian in 1978,

00:00:51.023 --> 00:00:53.043
I've read through the bible 18 times

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:55.238
and taught doctrine to all age groups

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:56.817
from preschoolers to adults.

00:00:56.817 --> 00:00:59.904
I've served as a youth
leader for over 20 years

00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:03.972
and as a Deacon in my church for over 12

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:06.858
and I believe that if
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:08.658
came to speak at your church,

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:10.283
He would have to choose from among

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:12.385
all the different bible versions out there

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:14.648
and he'd be forced to
pick just one of them.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:15.530
Which one?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.563
Well, the evidence shows
that the differences

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:19.710
between the King James Bible and any

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.567
of the modern versions are so great

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:24.807
that if the Lord Jesus Christ
came to your church tonight,

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:26.885
he would absolutely not use any

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.207
of the modern versions and would,

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:32.005
without question, use a King James Bible.

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.686
Now, the proof is all laid
out for you in my new book,

00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:36.405
Which Bible Would Jesus Use?

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:39.806
The Bible Version Controversy
Explained and Resolved.

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:43.080
And now you can finally have peace of mind

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.762
knowing in your heart that
you were right all along

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.724
to believe in the King James Bible.

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:50.220
That's because Which
Bible Would Jesus Use?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.146
gives you answers to the biggest,

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.980
nastiest, and most annoying objections

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.487
that you get when defending
the words of the Lord

00:01:57.487 --> 00:02:01.033
as they appear on the pages
of the King James Bible.

00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:04.738
From now on, when you hear
the same old childish comments

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:08.894
and name calling, you'll
quietly and confidently chuckle.

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:11.297
You'll feel sorry for those
who don't have a bible

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.097
that they can believe in.

00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:15.454
But you won't be upset anymore.

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:16.742
And you know what?

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:19.134
They'll stop laughing at your faith

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:21.514
in the written words
of God when you quickly

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:23.661
and easily answer questions like,

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.076
"Where was the bible before 1611?"

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:29.721
and, "Which edition of the
King James is the bible?"

00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:32.612
But you'll learn more like why the Lord

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:35.178
didn't preserve the original autographs.

00:02:35.178 --> 00:02:38.475
Plus, you'll get a unique
and unprecedented answer

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:41.598
as to why the Lord Jesus
Christ would not use

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.673
a new King James version
if he came to your church.

00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:47.612
And you'll learn how to turn the tables

00:02:47.612 --> 00:02:49.876
on your critics and go on the offensive

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:52.372
when you show them how
the men that assembled

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.378
that Greek text that underlies all modern

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:59.704
Greek New Testaments believed
that God made mistakes

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:02.897
when He inspired the original
writings in the first place.

00:03:02.897 --> 00:03:06.194
I call this the dirty little
secret of textual criticism.

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:08.562
You'll learn why the Lord
Jesus Christ could never

00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:11.243
use the ESV because of the genealogy error

00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:13.601
that's contained in Matthew:1

00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.422
or why He wouldn't carry
a NASB with Him to church

00:03:17.622 --> 00:03:21.135
because of how it makes him
out to be a liar in John:7.

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:25.233
You'll learn why the Lord
wouldn't use the NIV, ESV, or NASB

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:29.610
because of the known geography
error that's in Luke:4

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.117
and why the Lord would never, ever

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:35.334
use a 2011 NIV because
of how it makes him look

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:37.992
like a jerk in Mark:1.

00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:40.453
And you know, there's lots
of humor in the book too.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:43.297
I mention things like
Star Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi,

00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:46.838
the Grinch, Alice in
Wonderland, Humpty Dumpty,

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.869
NASCAR, and the old TV
show, Lost in Space.

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.523
Which Bible Would Jesus
Use? is entertaining

00:03:53.523 --> 00:03:54.964
and easy to read.

00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:57.299
It's not technical or academic

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.923
and it isn't another me too book

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:00.781
on bible versions either.

00:04:00.781 --> 00:04:02.360
It's got a bunch of fresh ideas

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.495
and answers to objects
you haven't heard before.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.282
So if you're looking for a book

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.441
that will solidify your faith in

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:12.797
the King James Bible and give
you answers to defend it,

00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:16.917
then Which Bible Would
Jesus Use? is for you.
