other<00:01:47.689> thing<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.079> bit<00:01:48.739> of<00:01:48.859> ideas<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.399> he'll<00:01:49.639> say

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
other thing a bit of ideas and he'll say

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.629 
other thing a bit of ideas and he'll say
lines<00:01:50.479> while<00:01:50.899> we're<00:01:51.109> shooting<00:01:51.349> well<00:01:51.979> cameras

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
lines while we're shooting well cameras

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.669 
lines while we're shooting well cameras
rolling<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.239> then<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.989> like<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.380> very

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
rolling and then so it's like this very

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.089 
rolling and then so it's like this very
alive<00:01:55.279> organic<00:01:56.119> very<00:01:56.619> spontaneous<00:01:57.619> feeling

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
alive organic very spontaneous feeling

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.809 
alive organic very spontaneous feeling
and<00:01:58.270> exciting<00:01:59.979> energy<00:02:00.979> that's<00:02:01.189> created<00:02:01.549> that

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
and exciting energy that's created that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.639 
and exciting energy that's created that
the<00:02:02.119> two<00:02:02.569> times<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.989> I've<00:02:03.109> worked<00:02:03.289> with<00:02:03.439> them

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
the two times that I've worked with them

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.559 
the two times that I've worked with them
I<00:02:03.770> see<00:02:04.009> on<00:02:04.189> screen<00:02:04.399> i<00:02:04.579> mean<00:02:04.819> it<00:02:04.969> is<00:02:05.090> captured

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
I see on screen i mean it is captured

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.510 
I see on screen i mean it is captured
that<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.869> camera<00:02:06.259> captures<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.799> because<00:02:07.309> it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
that the camera captures that because it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.179 
that the camera captures that because it
is<00:02:07.639> very<00:02:07.669> much<00:02:07.999> alive<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:08.929> we<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.679> had<00:02:09.890> scenes

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:10.189 
is very much alive so we we had scenes

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.459 
is very much alive so we we had scenes
together<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:11.239> know<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.900> written<00:02:12.200> one

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:12.469 
together that you know it's written one

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.600 
together that you know it's written one
way<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.189> we

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
way and then we

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.160 
way and then we
it<00:02:13.640> there<00:02:13.880> we<00:02:14.060> rehearse<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.720> David<00:02:14.870> comes

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
it there we rehearse it and David comes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.900 
it there we rehearse it and David comes
up<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.440> ideas<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.980> he<00:02:16.070> throws<00:02:16.340> things<00:02:16.640> and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
up with ideas and he throws things and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.520 
up with ideas and he throws things and
as<00:02:17.090> we're<00:02:17.300> doing<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:17.960> come<00:02:18.200> up<00:02:18.350> and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
as we're doing and that we come up and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
as we're doing and that we come up and
it<00:02:18.890> becomes<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.520> very<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.690> mining

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
it becomes this very it just mining

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.370 
it becomes this very it just mining
mining<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.950> deeper<00:02:22.340> deeper<00:02:22.670> deeper<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.660> i

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
mining it deeper deeper deeper and it i

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.900 
mining it deeper deeper deeper and it i
love<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.220> i<00:02:25.520> hunger<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.340> know<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.670> to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
me it's the best way to make movies

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.190 
me it's the best way to make movies
Christian<00:02:33.150> Bale<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.540> had<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> different

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
Christian Bale and I had a different

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.920 
Christian Bale and I had a different
technique<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.770> acting<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.250> set<00:02:35.660> I'd<00:02:36.660> say<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
technique of acting on set I'd say I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.850 
technique of acting on set I'd say I
just<00:02:37.200> try<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.350> emulate<00:02:37.710> whatever<00:02:38.160> he<00:02:38.310> does

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
just try to emulate whatever he does

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.650 
just try to emulate whatever he does
that's<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.010> take<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.970> fearless<00:02:45.360> one

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that's my take it is fearless one

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.540 
that's my take it is fearless one
hundred<00:02:45.930> percent<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.350> also<00:02:46.530> never<00:02:46.950> settling

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
hundred percent but also never settling

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.510 
hundred percent but also never settling
I<00:02:47.760> mean<00:02:48.750> there<00:02:48.990> I've<00:02:49.830> been<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.070> other<00:02:50.220> sets

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
I mean there I've been on other sets

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.430 
I mean there I've been on other sets
where<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.240> scene<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.870> got<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.200> scene

sell<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.300> anything<00:03:03.630> less<00:03:04.020> but<00:03:04.770> yet<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.950> know

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
sell for anything less but yet you know

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.460 
sell for anything less but yet you know
when<00:03:05.490> we<00:03:05.850> move<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.180> when<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.540> know<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.900> because

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
when we move on when you know it because

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.840 
when we move on when you know it because
something<00:03:07.890> real<00:03:08.070> happened<00:03:08.520> something<00:03:08.700> really

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
something real happened something really

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.790 
something real happened something really
really<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.660> scary<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.200> frightening<00:03:10.560> and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
really was scary and frightening and

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.680 
really was scary and frightening and
magical<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.850> musical<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.210> think<00:03:12.390> that's<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
magical and musical I think that's the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.180 
magical and musical I think that's the
thing<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.350> think<00:03:13.500> David<00:03:13.800> always<00:03:14.010> be

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
thing that I think David always be

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.580 
thing that I think David always be
striving<00:03:14.490> for<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.240> for<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.960> magic<00:03:16.470> to

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
striving for is to for that magic to

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.440 
striving for is to for that magic to
happen<00:03:16.740> in<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.070> movie<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.210> what<00:03:18.330> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
happen in the movie you know and what it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.810 
happen in the movie you know and what it
does<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.930> everybody<00:03:19.650> recognize<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.610> so

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
does is everybody recognize that it's so

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.300 
does is everybody recognize that it's so
palpable<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.380> frankly<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.830> why<00:03:23.070> there's

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
palpable and that frankly is why there's

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.160 
palpable and that frankly is why there's
no<00:03:23.460> set<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.970> david<00:03:24.330> says<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.810> not<00:03:24.990> like
