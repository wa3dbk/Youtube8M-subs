that solar power doodoo hacks a damaged

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.870 
that solar power doodoo hacks a damaged
but<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.800> really<00:01:23.800> just<00:01:23.979> wanted<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.280> be<00:01:24.369> immune<00:01:24.640> to

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
but I really just wanted to be immune to

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.150 
but I really just wanted to be immune to
the<00:01:25.270> earthquake<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.530> I<00:01:26.560> didn't<00:01:26.770> want<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.950> risk

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
the earthquake and I didn't want to risk

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.980 
the earthquake and I didn't want to risk
being<00:01:27.399> slower<00:01:28.240> because<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.539> think<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.810> nine

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
being slower because I think that nine

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.800 
being slower because I think that nine
tails<00:01:29.259> is<00:01:29.380> actually<00:01:29.709> almost<00:01:30.039> slower<00:01:30.490> than

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
tails is actually almost slower than

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.510 
tails is actually almost slower than
it's<00:01:31.810> not<00:01:31.959> max<00:01:32.170> speed<00:01:32.410> anyways<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.099> go<00:01:33.280> into

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
it's not max speed anyways I go into

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's not max speed anyways I go into
Venus<00:01:33.759> or<00:01:34.060> cuz<00:01:34.300> he's<00:01:34.750> bulky<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.440> he<00:01:35.709> takes<00:01:36.099> on

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
Venus or cuz he's bulky and he takes on

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.180 
Venus or cuz he's bulky and he takes on
grass<00:01:36.520> stuff<00:01:37.270> he<00:01:37.929> takes<00:01:38.110> on<00:01:38.259> water<00:01:38.470> type<00:01:38.860> moves

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
grass stuff he takes on water type moves

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.589 
grass stuff he takes on water type moves
eat<00:01:39.670> sponges<00:01:39.940> them<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.599> so<00:01:42.209> he<00:01:43.209> has<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.420> burn

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
eat sponges them and so he has to burn

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.690 
eat sponges them and so he has to burn
on<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.750> scald<00:01:44.050> which<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.380> fine<00:01:44.679> i<00:01:44.979> guess<00:01:45.039> i<00:01:45.490> go

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
on the scald which is fine i guess i go

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.690 
on the scald which is fine i guess i go
for<00:01:45.849> growth<00:01:46.119> right<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.649> got<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.280> growth<00:01:48.490> up

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
for growth right so I got the growth up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.730 
for growth right so I got the growth up
in<00:01:48.819> like<00:01:48.970> yeah<00:01:49.149> i'm<00:01:49.330> ballin<00:01:49.720> now<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.530> he<00:01:50.649> has

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
in like yeah i'm ballin now but he has

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.859 
in like yeah i'm ballin now but he has
