as<00:04:37.639> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:37.880> see<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.120> use<00:04:38.389> a<00:04:38.419> regular<00:04:39.100> hold<00:04:40.100> down

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
as you can see I use a regular hold down

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.360 
as you can see I use a regular hold down
on<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:40.730> end<00:04:40.970> here<00:04:41.740> we'll<00:04:42.740> go<00:04:42.860> ahead<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.190> take

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
on this end here we'll go ahead and take

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.550 
on this end here we'll go ahead and take
that<00:04:43.400> off<00:04:49.360> on<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.510> other<00:04:50.570> end<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.139> have<00:04:51.350> a

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
that off on the other end I have a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.390 
that off on the other end I have a
special<00:04:53.229> T<00:04:54.229> slot<00:04:54.530> net<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.889> I<00:04:54.949> made<00:04:55.160> up<00:04:55.280> with

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
special T slot net that I made up with

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400 
special T slot net that I made up with
the<00:04:55.520> universal<00:04:56.180> in<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.780> we're<00:04:57.260> actually

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
the universal in it and we're actually

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.520 
the universal in it and we're actually
using<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:58.190> allen<00:04:59.180> bolt<00:04:59.389> to<00:04:59.840> go<00:04:59.960> down<00:05:00.169> through<00:05:00.440> it

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
using a allen bolt to go down through it

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.860 
using a allen bolt to go down through it
and<00:05:01.460> hook<00:05:01.669> into<00:05:01.880> our<00:05:03.550> T<00:05:04.550> slot<00:05:04.820> nut<00:05:05.060> that's<00:05:05.660> what

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
and hook into our T slot nut that's what

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:21.900 
and hook into our T slot nut that's what
holds<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.260> in<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.710> head<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:07.070> position

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.490 

turtle<00:05:22.910> which<00:05:23.360> are<00:05:23.510> actually<00:05:23.840> jacks<00:05:26.380> sit<00:05:27.380> on

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
turtle which are actually jacks sit on

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.840 
turtle which are actually jacks sit on
the<00:05:27.620> table<00:05:27.770> like<00:05:28.100> so<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:30.550> as<00:05:31.550> you<00:05:31.669> can<00:05:31.789> see

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
the table like so and as you can see

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.469 
the table like so and as you can see
there's<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.300> tapered<00:05:32.750> bolt<00:05:33.590> in<00:05:33.830> here

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
there's a tapered bolt in here

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.320 
there's a tapered bolt in here
here<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.810> over<00:05:36.139> here<00:05:36.169> and<00:05:37.100> what<00:05:37.729> that<00:05:37.880> does<00:05:38.090> is

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
here and over here and what that does is

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.260 
here and over here and what that does is
to<00:05:38.479> go<00:05:38.600> into<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.199> head<00:05:39.410> bolt<00:05:39.650> hole<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.940> we<00:05:41.120> can

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
to go into the head bolt hole and we can

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.080 
to go into the head bolt hole and we can
stick<00:05:41.539> it<00:05:41.660> out<00:05:41.810> an<00:05:41.930> inch<00:05:42.610> down<00:05:43.610> through<00:05:43.970> the

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
stick it out an inch down through the

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.400 
stick it out an inch down through the
head<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.830> make<00:05:46.700> our<00:05:46.880> adjustments

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
head and this and make our adjustments

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.600 
head and this and make our adjustments
so<00:05:48.410> we<00:05:48.620> can<00:05:48.770> get<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.070> head<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.340> level

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
so we can get to the head of the level

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.100 
so we can get to the head of the level
to<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:50.470> cutter<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.880> anyway<00:05:53.389> as<00:05:53.660> you<00:05:53.780> can<00:05:53.810> see

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
to the cutter so anyway as you can see

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.520 
to the cutter so anyway as you can see
they're<00:05:54.380> very<00:05:54.860> simple<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.250> make<00:05:56.200> and<00:05:57.200> I<00:05:57.470> would

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
they're very simple to make and I would

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.120 
they're very simple to make and I would
suggest<00:05:57.830> you<00:05:58.190> make<00:05:58.430> at<00:05:58.610> least<00:05:58.639> four<00:05:59.180> and<00:06:00.130> this

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
suggest you make at least four and this

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.240 
suggest you make at least four and this
size<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:01.940> two<00:06:02.830> they're<00:06:03.830> about<00:06:04.010> an<00:06:04.160> inch

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
size and two they're about an inch

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.640 
size and two they're about an inch
taller<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:04.970> that<00:06:05.840> should<00:06:06.080> be<00:06:06.200> through

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
taller and that should be through

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.060 
taller and that should be through
everything<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:07.400> have<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.820> do<00:06:08.530> pretty<00:06:09.530> simple

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
everything you have to do pretty simple

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.779 
everything you have to do pretty simple
