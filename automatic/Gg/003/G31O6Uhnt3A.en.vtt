00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.340
 If they are not compatible with our 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.530
 objective 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.950
 we go to the gta folder that we have 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.780
 to stop these files we go inside 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.190
 from the gta folder we are going to download that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.040

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.240
 do the same with the streets we go to 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:35.050
