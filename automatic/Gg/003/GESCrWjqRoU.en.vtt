leaning<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> Shelf<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> just

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
leaning on the Shelf I think it just

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.910 
leaning on the Shelf I think it just
adds<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.570> nice<00:01:54.720> touch<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> background
