00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
band now when I designed this new band I

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.710 
band now when I designed this new band I
made<00:00:27.430> sure<00:00:27.700> that<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.000> black<00:00:28.239> band<00:00:28.540> which<00:00:28.689> is

made sure that the black band which is
the<00:00:28.989> step<00:00:29.259> up<00:00:29.470> from<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.919> smaller<00:00:30.279> red<00:00:30.610> band

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
the step up from the smaller red band

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.300 
the step up from the smaller red band
was<00:00:31.360> a<00:00:31.390> little<00:00:31.720> bit<00:00:31.869> wider<00:00:32.140> why<00:00:32.739> did<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:33.010> want<00:00:33.250> it

load<00:01:56.610> through<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.760> bands<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.720> can<00:01:58.840> go

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
load through the bands so you can go

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.990 
load through the bands so you can go
easier<00:01:59.380> dumbbells<00:01:59.830> but<00:02:00.280> really<00:02:00.670> load<00:02:00.850> your

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
easier dumbbells but really load your

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.380 
easier dumbbells but really load your
trunk

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
trunk

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.380 
trunk
another<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.260> interesting<00:02:02.950> concept<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.730> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
another is interesting concept is the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.050 
another is interesting concept is the
band<00:02:04.690> because<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.680> vertical<00:02:05.860> forces<00:02:06.430> it's

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
band because of the vertical forces it's

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.150 
band because of the vertical forces it's
putting<00:02:07.390> down<00:02:07.660> through<00:02:07.930> your<00:02:08.019> body<00:02:08.200> doesn't

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
putting down through your body doesn't

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.040 
putting down through your body doesn't
load<00:02:09.459> your<00:02:09.670> low<00:02:09.849> back<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.300> much<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.989> know

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
load your low back as much but you know

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.500 
load your low back as much but you know
what<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.860> really<00:02:12.340> activates<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.180> trunk

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
what it really activates your trunk

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.240 
what it really activates your trunk
muscles<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.050> activates<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.709> hip<00:02:14.860> muscles

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
muscles and activates your hip muscles

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.300 
muscles and activates your hip muscles
so<00:02:15.670> anything<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.510> want<00:02:17.010> activated<00:02:18.010> to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
so anything you want activated to

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.040 
so anything you want activated to
elevate<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:19.030> up<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.900> jumping

elevate you up like jumping

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.380 
elevate you up like jumping
hoppin<00:02:21.710> any<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.280> those<00:02:22.400> drills<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.210> hip

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
hoppin any of those drills the hip

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.030 
hoppin any of those drills the hip
muscles<00:02:23.780> are<00:02:23.870> really<00:02:24.020> gonna<00:02:24.260> get<00:02:24.440> loaded<00:02:24.710> so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
muscles are really gonna get loaded so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.310 
muscles are really gonna get loaded so
that's<00:02:25.250> why<00:02:25.460> I<00:02:25.520> like<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.910> setup<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.600> also<00:02:26.990> like
