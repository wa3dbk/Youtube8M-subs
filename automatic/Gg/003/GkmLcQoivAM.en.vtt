 bath is actually to launch pack halo 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.370
 and I thought I had to do that 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.570
 in the rules and do that a little bit 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.619
 more chic than in a bathroom 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.089

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:27.789
 Berengere Krief to do an operation 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:29.319
