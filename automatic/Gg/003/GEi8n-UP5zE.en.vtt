00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.410
 samsung original covers for s4

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.730
 two colors then frostbite his 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.949
 black and white 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.619
 let's look at the white in detail 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 pro because our class s4 and di 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.820
 white color 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.609
 inside the package we find the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.350
 then the flic cover 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.690
 I remind you that the flip covers are 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.000
 made the part in this way 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.300
 back goes to replace the cooper 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.269
 covers galaxy s 4 e battery 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.940
 before we have the note 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:57.190
 the afflicted cover that closes but 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.159
 Also on a portfolio that is lumine 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:07.270
 fixed ok we are going to remove the 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.510
 protection we also renew the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.510
 filling 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.100
 and here is the white bid to cover 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 as can be seen unlike that for 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.400
 the kala xvi s3 this for falls classes iv 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.690
 and realized in this way, that is, to one 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:34.240
 surface a little honeycomb that goes to 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.100
 recall what is practically the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.880
 cooper characteristic honeycomb of 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.660
 galaxy s 4 ok to mount it is a lot 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.240
 simple let's remove the cover 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:56.830
 special battery and let's go to 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:05.010
 attach that of the fit cover in 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.010
 this way here and voila is done 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.470
 we therefore have 4 caracristi with philippe 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.980
 original white cover 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.360
 here is the new galaxy s 4 is 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 You can converse by keeping the fig for 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.150
 closed because of course on the opening 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.270
 for a speaker and for the microphone 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.560
 of course the product is absolutely 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.450
 precise very adherent remember that not 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.660
 it has one that surpasses this part 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.740
 here the fixed there is no closure 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.740
 magnetic of another type 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.740
 I have no protection after that 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.550
 but possibly any scratches 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.670
 or scratches will affect not the cover 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.900
 original but that of the filt cover vi 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.900
