00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.260
 Obliers from the squad with and not some of my readers and subscribers about it 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.500
 have asked 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.750
 times to record a video on the subject of fast fat burning 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:13.319
 I would like to do that shortly and I would like to explain why 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.049
 I think that is relatively easy 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.409
 lose weight and keep weight 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.639
 I know that the goal is to burn as fast as possible 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:26.509
 and your best in ten days or twelve days 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.069
 to have built the cabaret friends 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.710
 but I also know the 2 most likely already a lot 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 Diets and maybe even movies or as so-called magic Bayern 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.320
 have tried 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.640
 Now let me tell you that through my fitness experience and with 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.650
 new knowledge 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.590
 on the honors and health countries on the last years 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.660
 while having turned deadly enemy of this sham poop 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.080
 Diets do not work 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.580
 because they are only applied for a certain period of time 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.750
 and because they are 95 percent associated with a lack of nutrients 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.970
 which causes damage to your body 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.480
 the latter two so Pillay 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.920
 Miracle fruits 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 do not work 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.900
 because they are for a placebos 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.730
 there is no crisis 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.090
 no fruit 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.240
 yes even no food which is able active 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.210
 To burn fat 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510
 and how does it work then? 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 and how can you maximize your fat burning Wuttig 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.770
 and if Julius Reiter should ensure people's folks first 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 to take the fingers away from this Monday 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.290
 for the burning of body fat 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.750
 There are certain basic requirements that you should actually know 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.439
 and there are some additions to it for your body and wellbeing 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.110
 miss the finishing touch and then accelerate fat burning significantly 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.470
 can 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.720
 Basic requirement for reducing body weight 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.330
 is a negative calorie balance 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.470
 You lose weight when you consume fewer calories than you consume 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.410
 very simple math 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.369
 and everyone who says otherwise 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.179
 «Say the untruth» 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.769
 and to ensure this calorie deficit 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.459
 You need to keep your daily calorie sales so the amount of consumed 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.209
 Calories a day 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.319
 if you do not know these calories yet then you should use it 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.489
 using one of the many and calculate a calculator 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.760
 That's easy going to Google de and calorie sales 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.929
 is received 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:35.219
 if you know a turnover now then pull from that number 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.729
 his face 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.919
 2300 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.849
 500 kilocalories off 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.470
 So this result takes as the amount of daily DR Lorient before 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.259
 about the diet 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.270
 As a result, a diet had to go like this 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.779
 That too daily we stick to the example 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:58.109
 gained a thousand 800 kilocalories 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.869
 and if you follow this strategy continuously over several days and days 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.269
 Weeks is created 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.239
 then you will lose weight 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.919
 Punk out 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.339
 just not finished 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.989
 because this is where the additional training comes into play 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.919
 if by a sole calorie deficit decreases then it is still called 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.119
 not long 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.159
 that is the body fat percentage is reduced 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.219
 Losing weight is not the same as burning fat 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.689
 the body fat percentage really does not decrease decisively 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.409
 if you are not just relying on the calorie deficit 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.310
 because the body keeps it from containing energy 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.260
 first from the muscles and not from the fat cells 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.689
 As a result, 2 knew only a few kilos off 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.280
 4 4 almost exclusively muscle mass 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.399
 while the body fat percentage stays the same 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:54.429
 You have to feel weak and impotent with this method and had to get one 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:55.879
 attractive body 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.769
 but even animals 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.409
 In order to prevent that you have to diet change so diet 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.289
 because the earth is nothing but a serious changeover 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.329
 to add the two elements that bring you there is Holding 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.089
 It means sport and high-quality nutrients 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.529
 I ded yen example 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.039
 if you do not do sports and do not pay attention to what's cool 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.430
 So I am haphazardly hungry 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.470
 then Boeing had to look like this young lady to her Nicole Richie 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.909
 Nicolai just stopped eating 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.789
 and what she ate 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.279
 contained only carbohydrates 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.819
 I'm sure Nicole did not have nutritionists at the time 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.599
 because no escape from the world 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.289
 at full mind it into 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.159
 Field a l Visiocorp Diet 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.009
 So a diet without any carbs 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.159
 probably she has to pick where read that the Rohkarossen too 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.110
 perform 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.090
 and that sport is not necessarily necessary 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.630
 where the result is she has this sickly and unattractive body 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.870
 hold 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.990
 One can only hope that it was a lesson 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.159
 well, what you need to burn fat fast 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.830
 but looking good and feeling good next to your negative 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.990
 calorie balance 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.030
 a good dose of sport and here I recommend you a mix 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.030
 high-intensity interval training and weight training 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.330
 give a quota oriented diet 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.539
 with the addition of the right carbohydrates 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.439
 These are, for example, brown rice hair dyes sweet potatoes 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.770
 and not forgetting carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.999
 which provide the valuable fiber percent 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.999
 and there breaks up a feeling of satiety 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.720
 Do you know to lose weight while still keeping the weight 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.770
 is not as difficult as it is commonly portrayed and 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.150
 not even if you allegedly go with bad condition 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.789
 is 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.720
 well i hope i could help something and tie in more tips and techniques in 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.779
 Things solved fat burning 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.789
 then I click on the link below the video on my website 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.589
 put together a free e-mail course in which I have something 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.839
 can go into more detail 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.509
 Greetings from the calf
