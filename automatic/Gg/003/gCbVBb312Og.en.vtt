00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.850
 hi friends with you total games 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.890
 I dug up new information about beta 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.020
 6 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.260
 information concerns precisely the game world 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.880
 that is, the game card is completely full 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 cards possible i mean i read you yes 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.660
 some moments of the article I will not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.840
 read in one and basically you now yes 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 on the video screens at the card 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.020
 possible map of the game world gta 6 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.750
 so listen 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.199
 the magata company claims that the port 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 until there is a zest and intrigue that is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.930
 part and may become gaming 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 maps and gta 6 that is it basically 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.680
 big here there are such a city ​​itself 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.760
 such highlands something like san 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.250
 andreas but los santos yes here and also 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.070
 to enter the city ​​is absolutely gorgeous 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.150
 the plot which in principle will be 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 attend floor and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.729
 the company has few the real estate 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 there was an idea of where should 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.340
 the events of the next part occur 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.820
 somewhere in the city of portland oregon 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.950
 oregon oregon well basically in japan in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.150
 companies claim that this city 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 just created for gta 6 more but 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.189
 but even created an approximate map 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 how virtual will look like 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.960
 port and beta 6 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.810
 that is, here on the map of my visit as well 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.329
 why exactly portland ask in well in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.689
 first according to company representatives 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.259
 In the city I have a large number of weapons 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:03.360
 shops and strip clubs and turning 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:06.630
 the entire population of those that they are even more 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.629
 one enrichment factor for the series 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 gta is an attribute of police 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.600
 plots that is mass nasty and 12 but here 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.210
 Martin de only 6 but here the firm is not 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.300
 confused and with all that could be 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.970
 less in number it will probably be 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.010
 least of all you care that is in 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.980
 Basically, these are the words of the swamp 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.500
 another convincing fact in favor 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.560
 the port to is that of this city 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.770
 your own yet incomparable style 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.270
 and those who watched the portland series 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.270
 most likely would agree with this 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.010
 feel the local city 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 fragrance writes company oh cardboard this 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.850
 a special taste that make each 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.670
 the last part of the summer is a little better and 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.250
 a bit clearer than the past we are 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.310
 felt for portland be 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.340
 appropriate to include a card bella shops and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
 cafe we almost even added a store there 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.060
 and sweaters 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 but this is probably too much if 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.270
 rockstar will choose for gta 6 words and the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.450
 they will have a great opportunity 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.410
 make fun of hipsters besides what 's in 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.710
 the city is located 637 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.780
 incredible cafes say little then all these 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.300
 coffee shops are waiting for you 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.210
 some local drug lord and arrange 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.490
 workshop for manufacturing 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.700
 any marijuana and so and those other 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.700
 Things of us said in the company recall 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.500
 what's the world on world sales gta 5 on 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.410
 this moment from more than 40 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:51.280
 million copies however still about ksor 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:54.390
 no panel but never before 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.220
 mentioned exactly some facts killed 6 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.350
 limiting ourselves to short statements about 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.420
 that they have several ideas 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.240
 where you can do our 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.770
 essentially friends yes that's how we are right now 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.350
 and claims that in the city of more than 600 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.040
 Cafes principle, well, why so much map 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.080
 vicar 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.049
 so here anyway something 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.810
 will cut something down by adding there 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.500
 your own unique card anyway 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.380
 will expand 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.000
 because it can not be 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.660
 less than los santos gta 5 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.030
 therefore, in principle, the city ​​is pretty 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.520
 interesting that is yes yes there is all that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.910
 need exactly the series somewhere here and 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.510
 Signature and the top of the mountain area and myself 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.180
 city 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.750
 so basically this map is the city itself 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.580
 portland is quite an approach moment it's 6 but 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.890
 here again comes up with the fact that 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.510
 that rockstar principle already said that 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.200
 want to revive 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.169
 wai city in gta 6 and part and here 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.210
 principle stands only 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.669
 let's say fan development yes that is 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.380
 asking fans for asking some 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.400
 pretty weighty media for that is 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.240
 press conferences of all kinds who are also 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.010
 want to contribute to the development of gta 6 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.910
 but here, in principle, it’s only up to 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.620
 developers therefore in principle if he 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.510
 now on look at the map she 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.390
 pretty little in comparison 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.940
 With gta 5, it is like a drop in the sea 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.669
 probably yes that's why its in any 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.540
 case you need to expand and refine 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.070
 add some more new terrain 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.540
 that's basically what i think with this 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:46.310
 developers handle 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.740
 the more yes it is really already 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.479
 today it is a breakthrough in terms of 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.710
 open world so it showed 5 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.260
 intently yes as far as can be 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.780
 the gta world is huge in the gta series 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.450
 therefore gta 6 should also show 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.700
 something unique if it is even 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.310
 there will be no open world then let it 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.430
 will be for example on the gameplay itself and on 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.450
 press plot anyway must wee 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.000
 emphasis on some one component 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.169
 so friends are like this 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.700
 a little news 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.350
 world map is possible and let's say earlier 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.229
 beta cards 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.270
 an early build of cards that's well and, in principle, 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.540
 pretty not bad i think that 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.070
 news deserves like 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.750
 so friends do not hesitate to set 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.030
 likes subscribe to the channel and 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.930
 comment on this news that you 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.850
 say by 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.720
 about this all friends thanks for 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.720
 view all bye
