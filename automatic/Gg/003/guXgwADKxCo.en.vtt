00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.190
 today I will make a salad dressing light 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.040
 and healthy with an unusual ingredient 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.140
 I am your amber men registered dietitian and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.540
 I really recommend that people eat 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.580
 salad frequently but something that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.379
 people do by regular is to soak their 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 salads with dressings with many 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.550
 calories and greasy so today I'm going to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.130
 show them a dressing made with a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.920
 unusual ingredient I'm going to use pasta 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.500
 miso the miso japanese pasta is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.260
 made from fermented soybeans and sometimes 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 has other grains added too 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.180
 adds a good salty flavor to your dressing 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.480
 and other dishes and adds something that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.250
 we call a mom a meat flavor is a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 really good basis for our 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.660
 dressing so what I'll do is start 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.840
 with a quarter cup of yellow miso 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.600
 this is the middle term the yellow miso 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.340
 it is considered average there is no white miso 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 which is soft and then there are the same 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.590
 reds and coffees which are strong and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 salty so let's start with the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.280
 medium and because it is so thick 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.440
 I need to soften it a bit 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 The first thing I will add are 3 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.150
 tablespoons of water and I'll start to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.840
 beat this a little bit to add the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 other ingredients 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.990
 then I will add as 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.180
 would make a vinaigrette dressing a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.440
 bit of acid I'm going to add a couple of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.440
 tablespoons rice vinegar 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.210
 I'm also going to put a spoonful of 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.210
 lemon juice 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.250
 now you can see you get a texture 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.230
 of salad dressing 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.650
 something that we can place on our 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.150
 vegetables and then I'm going to season it like that 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.450
 I'm going to add a teaspoon of 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.030
 dijon mustard and because it's a bit 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.360
 salty I will balance it with my honey and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.220
 some sesame oil not much 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.260
 only a little 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.480
 and finally this is optional 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.310
 but I want to add a little powder 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.310
 of garlic and a little bit of vinegar 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.510
 let's mix it and that's it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.340
 is all you have to do I'm going to 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.340
 place it on top of the salad 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.760
 one of the reasons why I like 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.400
 this dressing aside from that is so 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.620
 tasty is that it only has 20 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.420
 calories per tablespoon less than a 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.260
 third of what most of the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 dressings 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.939
 so try it is really light 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.939
 delicious in their salads
