Western<00:02:33.069> Rudy's<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:33.939> trick<00:02:34.359> for<00:02:34.719> high<00:02:35.019> heels

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
Western Rudy's what trick for high heels

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.229 
Western Rudy's what trick for high heels
to<00:02:36.400> save<00:02:36.639> space<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:39.219> one<00:02:39.489> heel<00:02:39.760> facing

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
to save space if you do one heel facing

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.459 
to save space if you do one heel facing
forward<00:02:40.719> and<00:02:41.019> one<00:02:41.200> heel<00:02:41.620> facing<00:02:42.400> backwards<00:02:43.469> it

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
forward and one heel facing backwards it

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.660 
forward and one heel facing backwards it
kind<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.269> mixed<00:02:46.269> them<00:02:46.450> smushed<00:02:46.930> together<00:02:47.079> more

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
kind of mixed them smushed together more

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.039 
kind of mixed them smushed together more
because<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.819> toe<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.269> wider<00:02:49.540> than<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.840> back

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
because the toe is wider than the back

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.520 
because the toe is wider than the back
obviously<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.419> anyways<00:02:52.419> it<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.200> gives<00:02:53.379> you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
obviously so anyways it just gives you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.690 
obviously so anyways it just gives you
more<00:02:53.709> space<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.980> I've<00:02:57.280> got<00:02:57.489> one<00:02:57.609> of

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
more space and then I've got one of

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.209 
more space and then I've got one of
these<00:02:57.849> great<00:02:58.030> little<00:02:58.090> box<00:02:58.510> things<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.889> you

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219 
these great little box things and you

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.159 
these great little box things and you
can<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.549> stack<00:03:00.760> your<00:03:00.969> heels<00:03:01.209> on<00:03:01.480> those<00:03:01.750> maybe

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 
can just stack your heels on those maybe

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.720 
can just stack your heels on those maybe
the<00:03:02.379> ones<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.709> don't<00:03:02.889> wear<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.069> often<00:03:03.340> because

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
the ones you don't wear it often because

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.360 
the ones you don't wear it often because
they're<00:03:03.879> like<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> nicer<00:03:04.510> ones<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.260> yeah<00:03:05.949> so

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
they're like the nicer ones and yeah so

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.490 
they're like the nicer ones and yeah so
I<00:03:06.639> just<00:03:06.909> take<00:03:07.299> advantage<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.319> get<00:03:08.439> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
I just take advantage of that to get a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.689 
I just take advantage of that to get a
little<00:03:08.769> more<00:03:08.919> vertical<00:03:09.519> space<00:03:09.689> and<00:03:11.400> I've<00:03:12.400> got
