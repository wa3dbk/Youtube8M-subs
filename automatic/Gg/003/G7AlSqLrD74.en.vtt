00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
sail inside on a pretty choppy day I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.420 
sail inside on a pretty choppy day I
think<00:01:12.580> we've<00:01:12.789> got<00:01:12.970> probably<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.630> south<00:01:14.430> wind

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
think we've got probably a south wind

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.600 
think we've got probably a south wind
against<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.890> outgoing<00:01:17.890> tide<00:01:18.159> which<00:01:18.490> is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
against a outgoing tide which is

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.139 
against a outgoing tide which is
probably<00:01:18.909> kicking<00:01:19.240> up<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.420> little<00:01:19.600> extra<00:01:19.750> chop

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
probably kicking up a little extra chop

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
we got out a little further it seems to

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.380
