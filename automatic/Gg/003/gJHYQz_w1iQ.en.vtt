00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
braiding technique I figured I would do

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.849 
braiding technique I figured I would do
a<00:00:39.489> little<00:00:39.999> series<00:00:40.569> on<00:00:40.899> its<00:00:41.140> own<00:00:41.350> that<00:00:41.589> people

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
a little series on its own that people

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.889 
a little series on its own that people
can<00:00:42.039> reference<00:00:42.309> whenever<00:00:42.909> they<00:00:43.120> need<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.600> just

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
can reference whenever they need to just

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.180 
can reference whenever they need to just
want<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.079> explain<00:00:44.499> a<00:00:44.559> bit<00:00:44.800> about<00:00:45.039> the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
want to explain a bit about the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.700 
want to explain a bit about the
techniques<00:00:45.609> I<00:00:45.789> use<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.510> video<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:47.109> use

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
techniques I use in the video I use

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.539 
techniques I use in the video I use
these<00:00:48.550> are<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:52.260> braiding<00:00:53.260> tools<00:00:53.620> what<00:00:54.129> is<00:00:54.309> it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
these are my braiding tools what is it

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:05.490 
these are my braiding tools what is it
it's<00:00:54.789> yarn<00:00:55.359> is<00:00:55.809> actually<00:00:56.319> gone<00:01:02.069> and<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:05.019> just

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
it's yarn is actually gone and I just

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.279 
it's yarn is actually gone and I just
find<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.430> much<00:01:06.460> easier<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:07.539> demonstrate

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
find it so much easier to demonstrate

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.950 
find it so much easier to demonstrate
and<00:01:09.009> explain<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.610> for<00:01:09.880> me<00:01:10.030> I'm<00:01:10.329> really<00:01:10.750> very

know the the synthetic hair like the
Barbie<00:02:23.550> hair<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.270> found<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.690> really

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
Barbie hair and just found it really

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.900 
Barbie hair and just found it really
difficult<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> practiced<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
difficult but when I practiced on the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.720 
difficult but when I practiced on the
yarn<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.720> clicked<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.400> I've

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
yarn it just clicked like that so I've

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.580 
yarn it just clicked like that so I've
been<00:02:29.940> used<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.360> had<00:02:30.600> been<00:02:30.780> user<00:02:30.959> needs<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.350> teach

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
been used I had been user needs to teach

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.190 
been used I had been user needs to teach
my<00:02:31.830> daughter's<00:02:32.340> how<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.670> braid<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.840> figured

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
my daughter's how to braid and I figured

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.130 
my daughter's how to braid and I figured
I<00:02:34.290> would<00:02:34.410> make<00:02:34.440> use<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.280> videos

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
I would make use of it in the videos

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.600 
I would make use of it in the videos
it's<00:02:37.140> great<00:02:37.470> especially<00:02:38.130> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> use

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
it's great especially if you use

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.390 
it's great especially if you use
different<00:02:38.790> colors<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.130> make

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
different colors because if you make

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.130 
different colors because if you make
mistakes<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.239> self<00:02:42.480> correct<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.959> can

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
mistakes you can self correct you can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.840 
mistakes you can self correct you can
see<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.890> colors<00:02:44.160> emerge<00:02:44.489> that

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
see if the colors emerge that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.550 
see if the colors emerge that
something's<00:02:45.330> gone<00:02:45.480> wrong<00:02:45.540> or<00:02:46.019> if<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
something's gone wrong or if the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.229 
something's gone wrong or if the
patterns<00:02:47.100> not<00:02:47.310> right<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.940> tell<00:02:48.090> if

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
patterns not right you can tell if

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.610 
patterns not right you can tell if
something's<00:02:48.510> gone<00:02:48.660> wrong<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.200> think<00:02:49.260> it's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
something's gone wrong so I think it's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.979 
something's gone wrong so I think it's
great<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.250> girls<00:02:50.760> love<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.209> they<00:02:51.540> enjoy<00:02:51.600> play

great the girls love it they enjoy play

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.660 
great the girls love it they enjoy play
way<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> leave<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> out<00:02:52.860> they<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.280> just<00:02:53.489> go

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
way that I leave it out they can just go

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.340 
way that I leave it out they can just go
and<00:02:53.820> play<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.209> all<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> time<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.140> they

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
and play with it all the time and they

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.250 
and play with it all the time and they
do<00:02:55.459> they<00:02:56.459> also<00:02:56.610> find<00:02:57.030> many<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.600> uses<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.049> it

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
do they also find many other uses for it

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.890 
do they also find many other uses for it
because<00:02:58.739> hey<00:02:59.190> there<00:02:59.670> wouldn't<00:02:59.880> be<00:02:59.970> my<00:03:00.090> kids<00:03:00.420> if

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
because hey there wouldn't be my kids if

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:14.300 
because hey there wouldn't be my kids if
they<00:03:01.110> did

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.400 

and<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.490> said<00:03:15.730> I'm<00:03:15.850> not<00:03:15.940> an<00:03:16.090> expert<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.900> just

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and like I said I'm not an expert I just

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.200 
and like I said I'm not an expert I just
had<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.830> lot<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.070> people<00:03:18.400> ask<00:03:18.580> me<00:03:18.820> how<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.060> do

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
had a lot of people ask me how I do

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.200 
had a lot of people ask me how I do
certain<00:03:20.070> Radian<00:03:21.070> techniques<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.790> figured<00:03:22.090> this

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
certain Radian techniques I figured this

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.030 
certain Radian techniques I figured this
would<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.600> easiest<00:03:22.960> way<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.860> do<00:03:24.010> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
would be the easiest way just do a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.980 
would be the easiest way just do a
collection<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.090> brain<00:03:25.300> techniques<00:03:25.810> that

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
collection of the brain techniques that

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.040 
collection of the brain techniques that
I<00:03:26.020> use<00:03:26.410> most<00:03:26.710> commonly<00:03:27.030> being<00:03:28.030> right<00:03:28.840> from<00:03:28.990> the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
I use most commonly being right from the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.410 
I use most commonly being right from the
basic<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.740> two<00:03:29.890> strand<00:03:30.190> twist<00:03:30.460> the
