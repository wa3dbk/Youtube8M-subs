00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.560
 But something like helium seems to be a bad substance 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.840
 As it is a safe guy for some time because it contains oxygen for parties 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 it's probably OK 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660
 So: The harmless and safe artificial air is written: What? 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 I'm okay because it's a little bit 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.340
