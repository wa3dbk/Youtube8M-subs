kinect one point oil kicked whatever it
was<00:00:33.360> i'm<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:34.200> moved<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.399> broke<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
was i'm actually moved and it broke a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.950 
was i'm actually moved and it broke a
lamp<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.120> i<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.480> why<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.809> changed

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
lamp so i think that's why they changed

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
lamp so i think that's why they changed
that<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.590> opening<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.520> logo<00:00:38.969> section

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
know elusive part of the console you
never<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.869> sits<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> TV<00:01:46.860> stand<00:01:47.280> or

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
never see it sits on to the TV stand or

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
never see it sits on to the TV stand or
whatever<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.240> five<00:01:48.479> years<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> then

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
whatever for about five years and then

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
whatever for about five years and then
you<00:01:49.560> bring<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:49.890> its<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.280> dusty<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you bring it out its all dusty so that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
you bring it out its all dusty so that
looks<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.780> could<00:01:51.960> collect<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.740> good

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
looks like it could collect some good

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.819 
looks like it could collect some good
amount<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> dust<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.820> now<00:01:54.689> looks<00:01:54.869> great<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
amount of dust so now looks great and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.190 
amount of dust so now looks great and
here<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.270> console<00:01:57.659> itself<00:01:57.719> now<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here we have the console itself now I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
here we have the console itself now I
will<00:01:58.409> say<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.280> content<00:01:59.670> itself<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.180> pretty

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
will say the content itself is pretty

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.660 
will say the content itself is pretty
heavy<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.950> heavier<00:02:02.159> than<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> current

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
heavy it's much heavier than the current

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
heavy it's much heavier than the current
generation<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.329> previous<00:02:03.840> song<00:02:04.049> previous

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
generation of previous song previous

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399 
generation of previous song previous
generation<00:02:05.430> console<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
generation console and it's a really

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.820 
generation console and it's a really
weird<00:02:07.710> weight<00:02:08.239> distribution<00:02:09.259> thing<00:02:10.259> it's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
weird weight distribution thing it's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.860 
weird weight distribution thing it's
like<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.340> heavy<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> left<00:02:12.660> side

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
like really heavy on like the left side

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.700 
like really heavy on like the left side
or<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.110> side

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
or right side

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.980 
or right side
remember<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:15.210> even<00:02:15.360> which<00:02:15.840> is

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
remember but it's like not even which is

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900 
remember but it's like not even which is
strange<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.710> think<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.550> left<00:02:17.760> hand

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
strange like I think it's the left hand

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.300 
strange like I think it's the left hand
side<00:02:17.970> which<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.270> heavier<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> picked<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.100> i

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
side which is heavier be I picked up i

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.640 
side which is heavier be I picked up i
think<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.820> due<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.720> air<00:02:21.960> flow<00:02:22.290> they

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
think it's like due to the air flow they

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.470 
think it's like due to the air flow they
need<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.920> keep<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> console<00:02:23.580> cool<00:02:23.850> they

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
need to keep the console cool they

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000 
need to keep the console cool they
obviously<00:02:24.600> don't<00:02:24.960> want<00:02:25.170> consoles

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
obviously don't want consoles

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.400 
obviously don't want consoles
overheating<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.790> whatnot<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.150> i<00:02:27.750> think<00:02:28.080> that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
overheating and whatnot so i think that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.500 
overheating and whatnot so i think that
that's<00:02:28.890> what<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.370> about<00:02:29.820> maybe<00:02:30.240> they<00:02:30.480> just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that's what that's about maybe they just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
that's what that's about maybe they just
want<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> keep<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.290> nice<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.470> bulky<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.130> they

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
want to keep it nice and bulky so they

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.830 
want to keep it nice and bulky so they
can<00:02:32.400> bring<00:02:32.550> out<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> slim<00:02:33.000> version<00:02:33.240> next<00:02:33.510> year

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
can bring out a slim version next year

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.280 
can bring out a slim version next year
but<00:02:34.380> hey-ho<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.750> business<00:02:36.750> cynical

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
but hey-ho that's the business cynical

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.630 
but hey-ho that's the business cynical
mind<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> am<00:02:39.770> so<00:02:40.770> yeah<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.430> I

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
really like the console is neutral it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.050 
really like the console is neutral it's
going<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.860> fit<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.160> more<00:02:44.280> people's<00:02:44.610> homes<00:02:44.850> I
