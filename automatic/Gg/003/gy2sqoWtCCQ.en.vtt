it's whisper-quiet - we design Brava to
cover<00:01:39.320> your<00:01:39.530> floors<00:01:39.770> quickly<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:40.970> also

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
cover your floors quickly but also

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.910 
cover your floors quickly but also
wanted<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.690> ensure<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.500> cleans<00:01:42.710> the

floors effectively that's why we

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.770 
floors effectively that's why we
developed<00:01:46.130> two<00:01:46.460> cleaning<00:01:46.790> modes<00:01:47.090> for<00:01:47.510> Brava

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
developed two cleaning modes for Brava

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.950 
developed two cleaning modes for Brava
