 good today we will learn how to install 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.590
 whatsapp in our tablet sure that 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:12.160
 you have gone to the play store and have 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.709
 looked for the whatsapp but they get this 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.410
 message says your device is 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.990
 compatible with this version so what 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.699
 what we are going to do is look for another market 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.020
 what is the mobile in market and what will 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.260
 install 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.529
 once installed they will go to the page 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 of whatsapp by chrome or any 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 another browser 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.430
 and we're going to download the application but 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.670
 we are not going to use the play store but the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 mobile 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 then from here we are going to install it 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.950
 let's wait for it to be installed 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.840
 here is installing 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650
 to wait a bit 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.879
 there he is loading 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 good and once I finish downloading 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.760
 get to have whatsapp 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 and they just have to put a number 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.040
 the number of what they have on their cell phone 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.930
 and they will come with a code to their 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.760
 cell phone and that code they enter here 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.760
 to validate the whatsapp 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.250
 well we see that already 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.920
