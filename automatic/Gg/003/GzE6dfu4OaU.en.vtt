feel<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.310> form<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:01.060> it's<00:01:01.300> it's<00:01:01.630> sacred<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.770> I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
feel a form of it's it's sacred and I

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.899 
feel a form of it's it's sacred and I
think<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.960> woman<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.440> sacred<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.700> think

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
think the woman is sacred and I think

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.000 
think the woman is sacred and I think
when<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.060> woman<00:01:07.480> wears<00:01:07.659> jewelry<00:01:08.020> SH<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.680> she

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
when a woman wears jewelry SH it she

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.170 
when a woman wears jewelry SH it she
just<00:01:09.250> glows<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.850> it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
just glows with it

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.850 
just glows with it
so<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:10.870> think<00:01:11.080> it's<00:01:11.200> it's<00:01:11.440> very<00:01:11.470> important

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
so and I think it's it's very important

so and I think it's it's very important
for<00:01:11.980> women<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.250> celebrate<00:01:12.760> themselves<00:01:13.000> and
