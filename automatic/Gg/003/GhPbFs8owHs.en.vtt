you know we get effect from that you
know<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.190> important<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:12.410> learn<00:00:13.410> from

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
know it's important that we learn from

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.460 
know it's important that we learn from
it<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.150> really<00:00:15.150> gives<00:00:15.570> us<00:00:15.690> extra<00:00:15.990> motivation

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it and really gives us extra motivation

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.460 
it and really gives us extra motivation
for<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.890> game<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.220> weekend<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:18.320> think<00:00:19.320> if

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
for the game of the weekend I think if

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.650 
for the game of the weekend I think if
you<00:00:19.560> break<00:00:19.800> down<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> game<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.820> wasn't<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> 4-1

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
you break down the game it wasn't a 4-1

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.179 
you break down the game it wasn't a 4-1
match<00:00:21.900> your<00:00:22.260> think<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.769> we've<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
match your think you know we've got to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.710 
match your think you know we've got to
look<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> things<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.090> by<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> same

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
look to things like that by the same

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.839 
look to things like that by the same
time<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.800> don't<00:00:25.920> give<00:00:26.130> ourselves<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.760> an

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
time we don't give ourselves really an

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.370 
time we don't give ourselves really an
opportunity<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> game<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.140> there<00:00:28.349> was

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
opportunity in the game and there was

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
opportunity in the game and there was
things<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.789> don't<00:00:29.970> reach<00:00:30.119> your

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
things that we we don't reach your

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.910 
things that we we don't reach your
levels<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.199> reaching<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.679> home

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
levels that we have in reaching at home

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
levels that we have in reaching at home
and<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.369> an<00:00:32.640> important<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> rate

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and it was an important one to be a rate

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
and it was an important one to be a rate
for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.559> rest<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> season<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
for the for the rest of the season that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.270 
for the for the rest of the season that
if<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.760> drop<00:00:36.350> small<00:00:37.350> percentages<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
if we drop small percentages here and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
if we drop small percentages here and
they<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.329> consequences

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
they are then in the way consequences

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
they are then in the way consequences
was<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> complacency<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.300> because

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
was it complacency do you think because

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.030 
was it complacency do you think because
a<00:00:42.629> lot<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> people<00:00:43.020> had<00:00:43.410> already<00:00:43.530> sort<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
a lot of people had already sort of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130 
a lot of people had already sort of
considered<00:00:44.550> west<00:00:44.940> Brahmas<00:00:45.390> being<00:00:45.750> safe<00:00:46.110> but

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
considered west Brahmas being safe but

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
considered west Brahmas being safe but
now<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> sense<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.579> whole<00:00:47.789> relegation

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
now in a sense the whole relegation

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
now in a sense the whole relegation
picture<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.930> fragmented<00:00:49.440> isn't<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> yeah<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
picture is fragmented isn't it yeah I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
picture is fragmented isn't it yeah I
don't<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.629> sure<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.840> complacency<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.800> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
don't not sure of complacency but you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.549 
don't not sure of complacency but you
know<00:00:53.629> things<00:00:54.629> are<00:00:54.780> being<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.050> well<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.410> home

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
know things are being all well at home

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.139 
know things are being all well at home
and<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.219> maybe<00:00:56.399> took<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.090> granted

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and I think we maybe took it for granted

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.779 
and I think we maybe took it for granted
that<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> case<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> then

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
that was going to be the case and then

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.459 
that was going to be the case and then
you<00:00:59.789> found<00:00:59.940> yourself<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> goal<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:00.899> by<00:01:01.140> wonder

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you found yourself a goal down by wonder

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
you found yourself a goal down by wonder
strike<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.309> set<00:01:03.300> piece<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> other

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
strike and then a set piece of other

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
strike and then a set piece of other
gold<00:01:04.019> down<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> another<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.010> Dracon

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
gold down and another one that's Dracon

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190 
gold down and another one that's Dracon
and<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> sudden<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.390> free<00:01:06.600> no<00:01:06.630> downing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and all of a sudden your free no downing

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
and all of a sudden your free no downing
you've<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:07.979> started<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.520> again

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
you've not really got started and again
