00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.450
 today we will continue gymnastics 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.549
 walk 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.669
 walking 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.219
 it is truly the most unique 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.189
 movements if you learn correctly 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.299
 walk 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.289
 as long as they would not have gone 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.289
 you go health 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.119
 and in order to 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.929
 right 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.560
 walking is important 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 feel 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.039
 where are you 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.039
 that part of the body that moves 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
 forward which moves first 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 now if the singer is standing 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.380
 at the edges 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.690
 break for an hour of politics 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 does she fly no feet 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 because if she is alive tom is not 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.520
 fly it head down no 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.410
 anal anal ing forward 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.420
 and here try to do slightly 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 small movements large movements 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.380
 unnecessary evaluation 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.390
 well the doings are doing opposite at the beginning 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 mirror 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.130
 if more than that went wrong if 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.630
 gone belly before especially the belly 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.840
 wrong too 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 movement no longer do what when you 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.280
 make a big move 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.619
 on the contrary you are tense 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.290
 will try to do without having a big 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140
 whole body movement 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.630
 so that the whole spine 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
 felt such tension unpleasant 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.800
 in no case just lift 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 shoulders top to back all relaxed 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.520
 some will say 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.500
 but to stand is not to be engaged 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.930
 gymnastics 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.340
 but I even saw athletes who 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.660
 deals with very serious species 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.640
 sports 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240
 Abdul admits cannot because 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.180
 stand 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.299
 this is a very large load 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.359
 but if you bet correctly 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.500
 This, too, magnificent gymnastics and if 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.669
 do the right thing 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.669
 to sit correctly 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.089
 that gyms do not need to go 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.349
 because for you 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.219
 whole life gym
