 seven areas at times the simple ones going to 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.320
 appear and then now they do in their 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.259
 I recommend it to your desk and what 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.880
 what they are going to do is double click and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.960
 now that what would have them that 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.799

 first decompress forgive me 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.370
 decompress first we expect some 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.440
 seconds that we delay the truth and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.330
 also downloaded in about 5 or 10 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.680
 minutes not long for a download 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 normal and being areas 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.329

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.640
 opening as there may be a problem 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.129
 with this zero disk image that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.270

 to arm and arm armani hand in hand 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.190
 see that it does not open to me are leaving as 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.030
 all weird 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.030
 to see see 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.400
 ready forgiveness and then when they open this 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.960
 those that will appear to you will be the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.090
 touched 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.170
 to lose they stop me here I have to have 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.720
 another maybe in others I've always 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.870
 I'm prepared, well, they'll have 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.450
 that opening it here is like replacing 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.390
 in vera that this is making you africa 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.010
 better said 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.840
 they already changed it but everything is that before 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.540
 it was one before I played a roll all 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.849
 rare and then now doing the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.050
 team already appears the aris galaxy and 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.980
 nothing 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.640
 by following the closing help as one day 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 lose my person and now he gets into 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.430
 the finder 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.050
 and they go here the section with says ares 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.670
 galaxy good here tells me twice so 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.080
 because the law and here tells me the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.060
 installation instructions but the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.030
 I'm going to say quickly it's very easy 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.790
 you just have to drag this ares 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.400
 galaxy to the applications folder but 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.750
 I already drag it then nothing and then to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.680
 I can put it on the desk or in 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.940
 elected here and good text of this one 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.330
 as you say and on the desk and nothing 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.010
 Well I opened it with a click as 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.000
 can see either open 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.000
 Now go read 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.109
 I do not find 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.449
 They are coming with bad vibes 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.550
 all right 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.790
 but this is not coming with good 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.840
 roll please do not go and see 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.980
 Let's see 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.780
 this does not happen 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.640
 the story seems to have taken a little longer 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.410
 It took me a while and so good here 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.420
 will appear the ares and then how can 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.280
 see is like with windows format and 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.380
 that's because this area is being used 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.870
 a program called witness king 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.350
 win skin which will have to accept that 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.090
 let's say he's going to say is accept it as in 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.940
 the win connections download so 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.710
 they accept normal and then they will leave 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.210
 open it seems by the way I recommend that 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.190
 never close these to zero when they go 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.770
 to do the application because they close it and 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.290
 because what is coming is how is a 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.890
 file which which if I do not 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.890
 wrong then 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.100
 decode the windows files for 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.620
 convert them into marc files and you can 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.530
 use this 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.500
 and well it is that the people that already 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.660
 let's know, it's very easy for them 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.300
 they put it let's say the song let's say 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.090
 limbo and put extra originated can 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.560
 put the options let's say to all the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.260
 video audio of the image in 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.570
 software documents and others how can 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.830
 see here everything is appearing 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.210
 available and I always recommend that 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.310
 always with the top because it's the most 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.770
 voted always with always has 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.990
 then to download 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.590
 double click and pressures to transfer 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.650
 here and then start downloading and riki 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.199
 if they want the one who listens to the song 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.740
 can you hear it in the ares or 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.510
 they will appear as here a 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.340
 folder that has a bigger background I hope 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.340
 what you liked 634
