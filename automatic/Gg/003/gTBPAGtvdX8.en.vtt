00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:09.710
 an obsidian generator like this 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.710
 let's go to the lava button 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.680
 again for us and we take the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 obsidian and the is with a design 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.800
 enough video for there are people that we are going to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 times and then they can learn to do it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 what we have here is a lot of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 dispensers up here to do 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.710
 to be exact 5 intense you see this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 moment a new step you do not have to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 do so long you can do it a lot 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.270
 longer much shorter than this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 I preferred to do it in five blocks 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 because if I'm talking too much ok 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.300
 this is that these dispensers what 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 they do is that they throw the new 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.270
 versions of sidewalks as you can throw 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.280
 this water and water from this from a 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.590
 same dispenser is full cai the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.590
 bucket with this side now kyle to the water 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.020
 as such that gives us the ability to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 can pull and it collects the hoop when 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.180
 we want to be in mind is time bridge 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.460
 that there is a reason if you put a bug 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.280
 english as they call this if you put a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 this lava on top of this rest join the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 rest is next to water falling 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 later by guards in that region 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.060
 it becomes the West and has been 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 here like a year and a half year ago 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.900
 he argued that the creators of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.520
 bankers are definitely not no 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 they want to fix it and we're going to start 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.660
 do it let's do the quick tutorial 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.240
 for above this axis we do not put this 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.200
 the blocks we want to make this block 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.180
 is that we are going to put here is going to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520
 mean the most after something that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 We want to make our this our 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 machine I do it five what is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 well because in exposed sir is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.040
 pretty fast but you can do it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.040
 much more 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.330
 5 what we are going to do with four blocks 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.090
 5 what then with japan on the stone 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.560
 red here to have this thing like this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.790
 red stone and then let's put 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.790
 bricks here 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.940
 more radioshack to obviously then 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.590
 brick can make a hole and thing that 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.909
 obviously it does not burn because water 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.509
 is going to swallow technically we are going to 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.250
 make a this a little circle here so that 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.800
 the water that we are going to put here back 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.789
 so do not get out of there let's put 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.789
 our walls here 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.130
 walls so that the water does not come out 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 s 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.000
 ops 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.440
 so let's put water up here 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.440
 with water as you can see we have the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.350
 water well up 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.460
 and here we are going to put an installed 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.560
 this we can side it like this 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.150
 manually but this is the idea of ​​this 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.250
 channel that do automated things 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.570
 and do tutorials of things that we're going to 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.590
 do let's put a jet of 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.590
 dispensation mariaca back 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.300
 obviously the dispensers a little bit 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.920
 more expensive to which you can make a 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.710
 contraction of pistons if you want but 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.780
 he can only reason if you do not want 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.760
 make our buckets here we are going to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.740
 put what you saw that you have here I am 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.740
 prepared but here we go here another other 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.050
 let's remove all those this ones 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.520
 dispensers with is here here there are 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.520
 who yes we are going to put our rest 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:38.660
 obviously we have to give our 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.660
 button here 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.720
 wallace 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.880
 this I had to give again because if I 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:52.040
 does this he does not realize but it is that 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.530
 once again touched things 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.560
 obviously you can do is that the button 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.540
 pick them up if you put them but let's 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.550
 make it simpler and let's do it is what 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.910
 that one has to do is put 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.940
 red stones carried hello so throw the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.660
 lava wait for it to be picked up 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.720
 again and take out the obsidian ok now 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.389
 this whole world knows that the option is 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.730
 be enough for me even when 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.160
 they are exactly 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.810
 a graph so that you know how much 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.010
 it takes and so you're not asking me 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.010
 can you get the math 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.830
 one with a chest with stone because 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.110
 because it is used enough had red if 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.150
 Do you have any farm of the witches? 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.150
 you do not know what this is 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.470
 state 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.139
 two
