00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.230
 everyone is gone for a new 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.090
 episode of public tours on the flat 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.190
 building local envelope me 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:21.980
 even on a modern building because 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.680
 I really like doing this is 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.940
 phases 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.380
 then when i'm in a phase i 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:33.950
 do a lot modern buildings them 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.600
 who is a mix of inspirations 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.559
 old dream and that I did 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.170
 that one 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.850
 the very first the gray there at the bottom 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.769
 this one not this one but not you 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.269
 remember if you follow the string in 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.309
 this spirit there to keep a coherence 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.250
 in the neighborhood I find even better 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.620
 does that one in style is in the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.110
 color even if something he even 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.699
 house of chestnuts often and in the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.610
 style a big fall fps it to have 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.510
 full of the term drags around the corner I do not 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.710
 do not know why not if I know 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 why obviously members of the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 server are 10th frame rates 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.799
 e 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 so a little bit like some that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.429
 you've already seen on my channel at 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.670
 level of specificity we have a 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.289
 ground floor a large ground floor 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 which serves as a relaxation corner of passage that 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.610
 is not housekeeping and besides 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.320
 living room and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.260
 of exhibitions the ried has in any case I 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 already done and quickly and then after 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.510
 sticks of stairwells 5 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.220
 identical apartment that are not but 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.920
 finally four are laid out and one case has 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.230
 been laid out by toto gougaud so the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.900
 rest will come or not we have a 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.050
 apartment to visit and as on 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.380
 other apartments a roof terrace 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.380
 a roof terrace 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 which can be extended into a megaphone 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.410
 organize parties with all 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.020
 neighbors can be accessed in any case 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.340
 we will see this and with nine days 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 so the main facade with the entrance 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.740
 most detailed cable the most 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.110
 nice but eventually each 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.360
 each parent or finally each face to his 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.330
 trick see here we have for example 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.060
 on the far right is the stairwell 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.090
 we did a little less work and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.989
 after we have the right there are balconies 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.750
 ideas and a lot of small balconies to 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.400
 pay a lot of small windows rather 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.420
 that yann hervé guégan three balconies by 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.430
 slaughterhouses yes because it's like a 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.000
 only apartment per floor have him when 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.000
 even three bullets we set 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.769
 not the big traces of the navy 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.870
 isolation but that's fine in the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.269
 cityscape it mixes well and 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.659
 then in the neighborhood is very good 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.340
 sure me there more than the entrance 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.859
 primary 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.230
 so on that one we can do we can 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.099
 he quickly make your powers I know 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.370
 not if I made a system of 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.370
 ventilation 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:12.100
 no no not on that one on the other I 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.340
 do this sometimes good ground there nothing 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.690
 special good short so it does not matter 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.000
 the reception had rejected the entrance 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.290
 main with mailboxes 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.400
 is there for now nothing I prefer a 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 big living room i think intriguing style 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.760
 I also use more and more often 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.290
 this side a little harlequins on big 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.120
 ceiling light on walls at these big 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.950
 also in modern apartments 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.060
 black grid when these dark and know 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.660
 not but I slice with a little bit 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.360
 stiff-faced harlequins like the carpet 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.010
 louvier typed in the eye this price be 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.080
 we have the stairwell we are going 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.110
 visit the apartment of togo obvious 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:05.050
 since he spared and in addition I even 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.790
 not looked nice or not so at the level 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:13.480
 from the entrance small wedge of the tendons 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:16.120
 coat rack agree then the first 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.109
 little balcony she put a small table 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.540
 still why your little coffee when 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.740
 even in the morning in the sun the day rises 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.000
 the bath that's it if there is not too much 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.229
 circulation if we will put that wants 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.560
 noise we imagined the neighborhood when 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:37.440
 even we never know so the show 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.280
 official here I think it's 20 years old 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.389
 I thought it was a chance but 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.639
 also a room dom and nothing for ba 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:48.310
 peg bath and then we can 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.320
 see on the way we are at the neighbor's house 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.630
 it's perfect finally the neighbor sheepish 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.070
 mattei vice versa that's pretty good 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.050
 take note when we are in the bath there 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:04.780
 there is nothing better 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:08.410
 obviously that of bath so agree 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.550
 gamer corner three screens I do not do 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:16.950
 crate 2.4 yesterday at 16 9th for what 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.820
 he does what gamer corner gaming I imagine 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:25.060
 I imagine very well here is the time the 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.210
 cooking here friendly kitchen a young 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.210
 well 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:33.459
 missing maybe a little bit of detail 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:38.080
 when we want to stick like this 

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:39.550
 like rigor to the ceiling but otherwise 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.779
 we will cook nice white wood 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.499
 like that because I was in the process of 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:47.649
 think about that white board sort that out 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:50.529
 not go wrong to make a 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:55.319
 cook squarely I remember the I 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:58.659
 remember I think my little au togo 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:02.979
 and the room and the room next to the 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:06.809
 kitchen agreeing furniture or his property at 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:09.490
 when we are a little con it is a piece of furniture 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.809
 fluctuat would have marked portable radios 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.499
 I would not have believed you 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:19.139

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:19.139
 room with small private balcony 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.439
 classic amenities but that is 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.949
 urgent and effective and above all I like 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.999

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.830
 French when you're tired of you 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.640
 wrong 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.980
 already at the base I do not articulate 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.440
 masses in more short is the block the idea 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.460
 number 15 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.520

 this modern building that gives you 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.169
 ideas of pattern ideas 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.560
 obviously ideas of shapes and 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:04.229
 color 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.910
 it is very important the colors 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:10.419
