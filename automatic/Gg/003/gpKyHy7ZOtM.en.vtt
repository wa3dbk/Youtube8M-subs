00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi everyone today I'm 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.920
 shows a small flash so fast to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.609
 put is quite important at a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.259
 run ramp 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.290
 so when we do a quenching rush it's 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.780
 when you have the best antero spawn 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.969
 generally was it before 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.740
 you alas this flash is going to serve 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.150
 really to flash the side that is going to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 find in this situation there when 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.300
 will happen to him he'll want to get 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.859
 position left side otherwise 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.910
 it's a place that really allows 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.650
 the flash and it's a phase that goes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 fall here and it's a flash that is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.359
 relatively instant and flashing even 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 if it was here so it allows 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.410
 to really flash the side that is in 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 this whole area and I'll show you 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.989
 after all, a flash for flashing 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.989
 the site and who is in this area 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 arrived with montreuil so it's very 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.829
 important for only first spot that has 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.739
 morning the first spa it will happen as 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.720
 that he's going to hit the stack splash here 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.640
 okay so on the white wall a step 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.680
 on the paintbrush frame it matters but 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 fast as soon as they see it so for the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 put it as quickly as possible 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 have to walk along the left for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.800
 that they attack like that it allows to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.019
 do not flash because we 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 could very well have put it 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.009
 we expect it to be the problem of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 this place is that it taps into 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.880
 same place ok but she's a lot 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.020
 more visible, ie we know it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.180
 Theval have much longer 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 so there actually in this case when we 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.880
 will happen 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.740
 you type your place like that is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.840
 behind the second place you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.979
 go m it's the flash so this flash 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 there will flash the guy who is in the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.160
 area there and now I showed you 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.660
 the second arrow usually it's 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.250
 in the sequence but both the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.690
 first spot puts the two the second 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.220
 phase that will flash this area there 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.250
 So that is the side that it that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.929
 time here is spent here so on cs go on 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.310
 problem of 16 go is that if you 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.300
 put a flash too far so we are 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
 okay question but a beach like 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
 that in the end she will not flash big 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.729
 world yesterday that she will not flash and if the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.650
 site was already in position here she is going 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 tapping them behind hockey and fetching 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.030
 they want flash is nothing at all ok 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.520
 So the most important thing is really 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.950
 the flash is really so the beach pope 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.909
 is closest to him so in the end if 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.380
 we look well where is what we want 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.470
 she fart this flash it would take 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 she fart we'll say here so not on 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.119
 the flat side because if we complained side 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.500
 again she may not be too 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.030
 visible by the principle was in the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.530
 slope and would really have it fart 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 will say the best it is in this area 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.329
 there it is in the closest zone 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.579
 from here it allows that even if one side that 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.049
 is like that with a little vision they 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.250
 also learn in the head and at and 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.410
 the top is still they are 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.610
 moment this draft agreement so the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.870
 first spawn actually all he has to 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.130
 to do in coming home as I do you 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.310
 showed it was coming but this flash there 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.269
 is the second flash 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.560
 I had no place but I you 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.329
 showed second flash 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.130
 it's simple the problem is that 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.510
 these of the momentum still so does super 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.519
 watch out when you put it do not aim 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.530
 not too much agree if you like it too much 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.030
 I explained you to be useless so 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.299
 when you arrive you the tap is 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.310
 almost in your feet ok ok that's 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.730
 more important that's it will allow 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 really 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.280
 to flash the ct that were there and so 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.420
 it's behind you do your 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.250
 concatenation that is to say that she will not 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.840
 fart hondt more too far it will flasher 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 also if he had already positioned himself 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.000
 even by being white because he can 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.370
 very well arrive there we are in white 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.160
 be careful look at my flash 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.960
 which I explained also for the flash 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.460
 instante who fall here so I have 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.820
 of my videos it can always be 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.370
 serve 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.980
 so I show you the execution so 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:28.800
 the flash ag no I have one that will be 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:28.800
 simpler with 2 here you are 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.230
 do it like that it's not 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.590
 so we get first normal flash 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.819
 and second flash on the ground alas this 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.109
 flash the leap to the ap was there in 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.519
 the occurrence because I aimed a little 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.000
 too much on the ground you understood the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.439
 principle 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.239
 and that really allows you to take 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.459
 the ramp very very quickly agree 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.659
 seven matches there or not cap is too far 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.560
 because you saw she pleaded 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.540
 still much further 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.219
 so be very careful and 7 flash the 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.450
 you behind you dodge it so 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.859
 two possibility fish 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.359
 to duck a knowing that this is the 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.620
 first sport gets involved 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.629
 he can put himself like this and after 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.220
 come out okay but he can very well 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.620
 knowing that the site is right and 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.349
 white and can very well arrive m 7 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.000
 flash and shifted the side she has during 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.650
 that his friends are in the process 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.940
 to move forward so he's using it there and can 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.090
 directly go out to fetch 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.169
 it was there ok it's super important 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.669
 do not take this place there no 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.380
 more not otherwise it would ruin everything 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.520
 your eye but the most important thing is 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.300
 really be it the first spawn 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.720
 who puts her in the end so this is 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.530
 this one you saw we can still 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.910
 hard to take it when you're 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.500
 first spawn but pay attention to 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.270
 your email them they will not have 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.340
 really the timing of the flash this will be 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.409
 very hard at them to edit it so that's getting 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.150
 at least you work that in 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.490
 your eye that you knew you 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.289
 know that you know that everyone must 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.699
 put his place and the first spot ccl2 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.560
 flash there that has to put behind the 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.940
 ramp you learn it without problem 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.930
 the important thing is really very 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.930
 fast in execution
