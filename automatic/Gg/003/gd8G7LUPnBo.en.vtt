00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
wasn't something again to go crazy over

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.790 
wasn't something again to go crazy over
I<00:02:50.220> mean<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.270> seeing<00:02:51.570> saw<00:02:51.840> Zuri<00:02:52.140> again<00:02:52.500> for

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
I mean I like seeing saw Zuri again for

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.770 
I mean I like seeing saw Zuri again for
a<00:02:52.830> little<00:02:53.160> bit<00:02:54.230> table<00:02:55.230> toe<00:02:56.209> background<00:02:57.209> more

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
a little bit table toe background more

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.500 
a little bit table toe background more
it<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.890> just<00:02:59.100> wasn't<00:02:59.370> something<00:02:59.640> the<00:03:00.330> best

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it really just wasn't something the best

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.750 
it really just wasn't something the best
thing<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.810> could<00:03:00.990> say<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.700> for<00:03:02.700> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
thing I could say is that for a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.550 
thing I could say is that for a
flashback<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.630> could<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.900> been<00:03:04.020> worse<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
flashback it could have been worse I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920 
flashback it could have been worse I
guess<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.910> something<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.300> I'm<00:03:06.660> pretty

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
guess but it's something that I'm pretty

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.130 
guess but it's something that I'm pretty
sure<00:03:07.230> most<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.800> us<00:03:07.950> aren't<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:09.140> caring

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
sure most of us aren't really caring

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.240
