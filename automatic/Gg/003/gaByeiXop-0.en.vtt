00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.520
 the bike is made in China at the factory 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.910
 tire umbrella to Russia comes as stealth 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.340
 at x2 250 like many of its chinese 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.170
 fellow he is a copy of one of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.120
 major motorcycle manufacturers on 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.120
 this time this honda se 300r 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.490
 they 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.870
 looks at least very similar by 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.400
 technical part of honda engine 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.780
 more powerful by ten horsepower and more 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.690
 on sixty six cubes 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.670
 just also principle can 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.220
 encode stickers stealth glue honda 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:07.430
 and no one will know anything but honda 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 currently 300r produced in brazil 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.000
 Russia he is not shipped buy it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.460
 almost impossible and his price is 11 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.170
 and a half thousand dollars therefore not 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.140
 need to fly in the clouds here is a motorcycle 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.860
 173 thousand rubles, let's consider it 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.710
 in more detail 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.080
 managed the bread 250 has a single cylinder 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.300
 16-stroke four-stroke engine 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 main forces volume is 225 cubic 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.860
 centimeters five-speed box 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.630
 classical type of the first few 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.450
 upstairs 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.439
 it means we have a classic plug in front 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.439
 not turned upside down 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.329
 pendulum suspension with mono absorber 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.719
 mean front and back here 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:54.890
 hydraulic disc brakes 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.740
 then around the engine we have this 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.740
 sturdy steel frame 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.040
 fuel tank 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.860
 18 liters three and a half liters 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.210
 per hundred average, respectively, the stock 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 we have a very big move 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.259
 maximum speed in the region of a hundred 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.590
 thirty kilometers per hour but now 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.569
 bypass lead works 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.780
 also like many motorcycle children protection 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.500
 the ignition lock closes so that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.470
 open you need to put the key here 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:31.970
 we turn 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:34.870
 turn open the button 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.870
 electric starter here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.140
 milena 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.850
 it so as for optics on how 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.750
 then how to turn it off 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.460
 dimensions 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.460
 the corners of the lights come on 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.270
 and dim light 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.830
 and the headlights to the authorities as well 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.400
 as if blinking with high beams 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.400
 Does not help 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.250
 well, so the tone works 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.880
 but now let's take a little ride 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.250
