00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.189 
need a sketch book you'll need some
black<00:00:13.500> markers<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.250> draw<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.839> so<00:00:15.839> let's<00:00:16.049> get

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
black markers to draw with so let's get

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.439 
black markers to draw with so let's get
started<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.770> our<00:00:16.800> BMX<00:00:17.430> bike<00:00:17.730> we're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.390> to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
started on our BMX bike we're going to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.859 
started on our BMX bike we're going to
start<00:00:18.750> off<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.109> really<00:00:19.380> basic<00:00:20.010> shapes<00:00:20.869> I'm

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
start off with really basic shapes I'm

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.019 
start off with really basic shapes I'm
going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> start<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:23.250> circles<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
going to start off with circles for the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.920 
going to start off with circles for the
front<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> back<00:00:24.960> tires<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
front and back tires and we're going to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.330 
front and back tires and we're going to
do<00:00:28.109> another<00:00:28.349> circle<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> center<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
do another circle in the center for the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.180 
do another circle in the center for the
cylinder<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.530> you<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> very

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
cylinder and you think that it's a very

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
cylinder and you think that it's a very
complicated<00:00:35.820> drawing<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> really

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
complicated drawing but it really

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
complicated drawing but it really
doesn't<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> can

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
doesn't have to be because as you can

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.819 
doesn't have to be because as you can
see<00:00:39.000> I'm<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.300> putting<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.050> basic<00:00:40.559> shapes

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
see I'm just putting in basic shapes

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
see I'm just putting in basic shapes
right<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> outline<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
right now that's going to outline the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.750 
right now that's going to outline the
bike<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> draw

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
bike and we're just going to draw

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.990 
bike and we're just going to draw
another<00:00:45.030> line<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.780> another<00:00:46.289> line<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
another line and another line here to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.959 
another line and another line here to
connect<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> handlebars<00:00:49.789> we're<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
connect to the handlebars we're going to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
connect to the handlebars we're going to
almost<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.719> rectangular<00:00:52.230> shape<00:00:52.680> up

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
almost do a little rectangular shape up

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.020 
almost do a little rectangular shape up
here<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.770> then<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:56.039> u-shape<00:00:56.670> here

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
here and then a little u-shape here

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
here and then a little u-shape here
that's<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> form<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> handlebars<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that's going to form the handlebars and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.479 
that's going to form the handlebars and
we're<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.399> two<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.940> circles

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
we're going to do two little circles

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.680 
we're going to do two little circles
then<00:01:02.489> we're<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> draw<00:01:03.000> another<00:01:03.270> little

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
then we're going to draw another little

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.730 
then we're going to draw another little
line<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.619> lines<00:01:04.799> coming<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.740> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
line two little lines coming up here and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
line two little lines coming up here and
we're<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.610> quickly<00:01:08.909> draw<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
we're going to just quickly draw in the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.010 
we're going to just quickly draw in the
saddle<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.530> bike

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
saddle for the bike

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.630 
saddle for the bike
and<00:01:13.020> we're<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.290> draw<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.680> lines<00:01:14.159> coming

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and we're going to draw two lines coming

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
and we're going to draw two lines coming
back<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> connect<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> back<00:01:16.590> tires

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
back here to connect to the back tires

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.550 
back here to connect to the back tires
so<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.509> fairly<00:01:18.960> basic

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so you can see that was fairly basic

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
so you can see that was fairly basic
shapes<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.970> drawing<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.540> think

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
shapes and in a drawing that you think

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.920 
shapes and in a drawing that you think
might<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.170> very<00:01:22.409> complicated<00:01:23.720> we're<00:01:24.720> just

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
might be very complicated we're just

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.179 
might be very complicated we're just
going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> draw<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.590> another<00:01:25.830> line<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:28.189> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
going to draw in another line here so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.670 
going to draw in another line here so
that<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:31.020> tires<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that we get the tires and we're going to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.520 
that we get the tires and we're going to
draw<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.460> line<00:01:35.640> coming<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
draw one little line coming out here and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
draw one little line coming out here and
we're<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.189> draw<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.640> little

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
we're going to just draw a little

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.520 
we're going to just draw a little
rectangle<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.759> can<00:01:41.759> see<00:01:42.000> how<00:01:42.240> easily<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
rectangle and you can see how easily we

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
rectangle and you can see how easily we
fit<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> pedal<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:45.479> we're<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.840> going

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
fit that pedal in and we're just going

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.710 
fit that pedal in and we're just going
to<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:47.130> cylinders<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> gears

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to do the cylinders here for the gears

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
to do the cylinders here for the gears
and<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.869> draw<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> series<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.560> little

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and then you can draw a series of little

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then you can draw a series of little
circles<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:55.500> depict<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> chain<00:01:56.310> coming

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
circles to depict the chain coming

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
circles to depict the chain coming
around<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.659> gears<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:01.380> we'll<00:02:01.560> put<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
around the gears and then we'll put in a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.279 
around the gears and then we'll put in a
few<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.520> lines<00:02:03.890> really<00:02:04.890> quickly

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
few little lines really quickly

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.839 
few little lines really quickly
and<00:02:08.289> there<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.459> it

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
and there you have it

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.990 
and there you have it
a<00:02:10.000> BMX<00:02:10.660> bike<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:12.250> has<00:02:12.430> been<00:02:12.580> Jacqueline

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
a BMX bike this has been Jacqueline
