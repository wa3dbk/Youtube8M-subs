00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
using to create their art piece so first

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.900 
using to create their art piece so first
up<00:01:10.240> we've<00:01:10.420> got<00:01:10.450> our<00:01:11.140> paints<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.160> then<00:01:12.610> white

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910

up we've got our paints so then white
acrylic<00:01:13.390> paint<00:01:13.570> student<00:01:14.560> versions<00:01:15.550> there<00:01:15.729> are

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
acrylic paint student versions there are

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.529 
acrylic paint student versions there are
different<00:01:16.899> cars<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.170> obviously<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:18.160> colors

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
different cars and obviously the colors

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.270 
different cars and obviously the colors
completely<00:01:19.539> depend<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.319> you<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.860> you'd<00:01:21.039> want

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
completely depend on you so you'd want

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.889 
completely depend on you so you'd want
to<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.459> it<00:01:21.550> made<00:01:22.090> probably<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.660> primary

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
to have it made probably the primary

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.880 
to have it made probably the primary
colors<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.860> children<00:01:24.459> can<00:01:24.869> mix<00:01:25.869> their<00:01:26.619> colors

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
colors and children can mix their colors

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.760 
colors and children can mix their colors
and<00:01:26.979> make<00:01:27.160> other<00:01:27.340> colors<00:01:27.550> um<00:01:28.319> to<00:01:29.319> create<00:01:29.649> that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
and make other colors um to create that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.719 
and make other colors um to create that
impasto<00:01:30.490> style<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.360> can<00:01:31.690> use<00:01:32.110> an<00:01:32.729> impasto

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
impasto style you can use an impasto

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.410 
impasto style you can use an impasto
medium<00:01:34.239> but<00:01:34.509> it<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:35.369> very<00:01:36.369> expensive<00:01:36.970> and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
medium but it is very expensive and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.800 
medium but it is very expensive and
probably<00:01:38.110> not<00:01:38.380> practical<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.250> school

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
probably not practical for the school

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.089 
probably not practical for the school
setting<00:01:40.810> but<00:01:40.959> glue<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:42.690> found<00:01:43.709> does<00:01:44.709> work<00:01:45.069> quite

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
setting but glue I found does work quite

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.150 
setting but glue I found does work quite
well<00:01:46.080> when<00:01:47.080> added<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.619> paint<00:01:47.890> doesn't

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
well when added to the paint doesn't

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.669 
well when added to the paint doesn't
change<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.789> color<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.420> paint<00:01:49.660> but<00:01:50.560> it

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
change the color of the paint but it

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.400 
change the color of the paint but it
just<00:01:50.970> creates<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.209> become<00:01:52.479> thicker<00:01:52.929> and<00:01:53.140> it

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
just creates it to become thicker and it

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.859 
just creates it to become thicker and it
also<00:01:53.590> enhances<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.369> drawing<00:01:54.670> time<00:01:55.060> as<00:01:55.360> you

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
also enhances the drawing time as you

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.270 
also enhances the drawing time as you
know<00:01:55.989> the<00:01:56.170> properties<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.709> the<00:01:56.800> glue<00:01:57.039> I<00:01:59.280> read

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
know the properties and the glue I read

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.130 
know the properties and the glue I read
somewhere<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.759> quilty<00:02:01.619> tried<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.770> find

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
somewhere that quilty tried to find

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.440 
somewhere that quilty tried to find

to<00:02:40.430> use<00:02:40.460> because<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.210> lot<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.630> children<00:02:42.140> you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
to use because a lot of children you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.410 
to use because a lot of children you
know<00:02:43.250> probably<00:02:43.670> use<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.120> having<00:02:44.360> a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
know probably use just having a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.670 
know probably use just having a
paintbrush<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.200> paint<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:47.240> too<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.500> know

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
paintbrush to paint on that too you know

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.340 
paintbrush to paint on that too you know
so<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.640> really<00:02:50.480> good<00:02:50.690> thing<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.960> for<00:02:51.260> them

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
so it's a really good thing to for them

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:13.060 
so it's a really good thing to for them
to<00:02:51.380> use<00:03:10.060> how<00:03:11.060> how<00:03:11.510> these<00:03:11.810> tools<00:03:12.290> we<00:03:12.470> use<00:03:12.770> to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
to use how how these tools we use to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.520 
to use how how these tools we use to
create<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:15.350> what<00:03:15.770> does<00:03:16.670> pop<00:03:16.880> some<00:03:17.150> blue<00:03:17.870> so

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
create so what does pop some blue so

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.020 
create so what does pop some blue so
we're<00:03:18.680> not<00:03:18.770> really<00:03:19.250> looking<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.670> paint

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
we're not really looking to paint

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.340 
we're not really looking to paint
anything<00:03:20.800> serious<00:03:21.800> but<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:22.190> we<00:03:22.670> can<00:03:22.820> get<00:03:22.970> out

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
anything serious but then we can get out

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.820 
anything serious but then we can get out
our<00:03:24.350> glue<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.100> is<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.350> thicken<00:03:27.620> up

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
our glue so this is going to thicken up

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.770 
our glue so this is going to thicken up
our<00:03:28.220> paint<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:28.730> we<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:28.940> add<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
our paint and we can add that to the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.640 
our paint and we can add that to the
paint<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.330> was<00:03:32.510> just<00:03:32.540> mix<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.380> around

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
paint and so I was just mix that around

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.380 
paint and so I was just mix that around
a<00:03:34.010> bit<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:40.040> although<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:40.670> not<00:03:40.850> as<00:03:41.030> good<00:03:41.330> as

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
a bit so although it's not as good as

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.270 
a bit so although it's not as good as
the<00:03:41.660> impasto<00:03:42.820> medium<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.030> still<00:03:44.690> does<00:03:45.280> thicken

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
the impasto medium it still does thicken

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.160 
the impasto medium it still does thicken
up<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:48.440> paint<00:03:48.769> we<00:03:48.980> are<00:03:49.100> using<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.600> what<00:03:50.870> we<00:03:51.019> can

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
up the paint we are using so what we can

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.330 
up the paint we are using so what we can
you<00:03:51.320> do<00:03:51.769> with<00:03:51.920> our<00:03:52.070> spoon<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.900> we<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:54.190> scoop<00:03:55.190> it

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
you do with our spoon so we can scoop it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.430 
you do with our spoon so we can scoop it
up<00:03:55.489> life<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.239> know<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.600> people<00:03:56.959> we're<00:03:57.140> having

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
up life you know the people we're having

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.979 
up life you know the people we're having
some<00:03:57.650> cereal<00:03:58.160> or<00:03:58.190> something<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.660> can<00:03:59.810> just

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
some cereal or something and we can just

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.039 
some cereal or something and we can just
simply<00:04:00.620> just<00:04:00.830> pop<00:04:01.130> it<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.610> tank<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.750> we

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
simply just pop it on the tank and we

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.610 
simply just pop it on the tank and we
can<00:04:03.260> smooth<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.070> out<00:04:04.280> we<00:04:05.269> can<00:04:05.420> use<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:06.290> back<00:04:06.560> of

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
can smooth it out we can use the back of

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.509 
can smooth it out we can use the back of
it<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.100> smooth<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.940> over<00:04:08.140> we've<00:04:09.140> got<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.310> can

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
it to smooth it over we've got so I can

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.120 
it to smooth it over we've got so I can
create<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:11.090> circle<00:04:11.920> see<00:04:12.920> how<00:04:13.100> it's<00:04:13.310> thick<00:04:13.840> in

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
create a circle see how it's thick in

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.750 
create a circle see how it's thick in
yeah<00:04:16.130> we<00:04:16.729> can<00:04:16.880> pat<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.299> down<00:04:18.190> like<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.220> I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
yeah we can pat it down like that I

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.680 
yeah we can pat it down like that I
think<00:04:20.390> makes<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:22.280> paint<00:04:22.580> really<00:04:23.060> thick<00:04:23.540> and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
think makes the paint really thick and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.830 
think makes the paint really thick and
lush<00:04:25.750> okay<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:27.080> what<00:04:27.470> we<00:04:27.590> can<00:04:28.030> use<00:04:29.030> well<00:04:29.540> I'll

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
lush okay so what we can use well I'll

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.750 
lush okay so what we can use well I'll
just<00:04:30.110> show<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.680> on<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.040> different<00:04:31.460> thing<00:04:31.640> we

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
just show you on a different thing we

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.790 
just show you on a different thing we
can

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.999 

smear<00:04:37.729> it<00:04:37.970> on<00:04:40.300> so<00:04:41.409> children<00:04:42.409> can<00:04:42.590> use<00:04:42.770> these

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
smear it on so children can use these

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.740 
smear it on so children can use these
sort<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.400> techniques<00:04:43.849> but<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.300> important

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
sort of techniques but it's important

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.270 
sort of techniques but it's important
that<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:45.050> demonstrate<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.919> to<00:04:45.949> them

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
that you demonstrate it to them

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.930 
that you demonstrate it to them
otherwise<00:04:51.009> so<00:04:52.009> that's<00:04:52.190> another<00:04:52.430> thing<00:04:52.550> we<00:04:52.789> can

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
otherwise so that's another thing we can

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.059 
otherwise so that's another thing we can
use<00:04:53.379> can<00:04:54.379> use<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.569> knife<00:04:56.569> to<00:04:56.930> smear<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.770> paint

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
use can use the knife to smear the paint

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.930 
use can use the knife to smear the paint
on<00:04:58.750> so<00:04:59.750> we<00:04:59.870> get<00:05:00.080> some<00:05:00.349> different<00:05:00.560> textures<00:05:01.400> in

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
on so we get some different textures in

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.420 
on so we get some different textures in
our<00:05:02.810> painting<00:05:05.470> obviously<00:05:06.470> if<00:05:07.009> we're<00:05:07.220> using

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
our painting obviously if we're using

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.600 
our painting obviously if we're using
our<00:05:09.610> bigger<00:05:10.610> spatulas<00:05:11.919> it's<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:13.039> same<00:05:13.340> sort

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
our bigger spatulas it's the same sort

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.450 
our bigger spatulas it's the same sort
of<00:05:13.669> effect<00:05:13.789> as<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:15.490> as<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:18.259> knife<00:05:18.469> we<00:05:18.800> just<00:05:18.979> can

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
of effect as a as the knife we just can

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.480 
of effect as a as the knife we just can
just<00:05:21.250> swipe<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.669> so<00:05:23.030> we<00:05:23.150> can<00:05:23.419> create<00:05:23.810> some

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
just swipe it on so we can create some

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.180 
just swipe it on so we can create some
nice<00:05:25.490> different<00:05:26.090> effects<00:05:26.449> that<00:05:26.919> were<00:05:27.919> at<00:05:28.039> our

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
nice different effects that were at our

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.830 
nice different effects that were at our
painting<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:28.879> these<00:05:29.000> sort<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.419> effects<00:05:29.690> of

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
painting so these sort of effects of

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.390 
painting so these sort of effects of
what<00:05:29.990> we're<00:05:30.139> aiming<00:05:30.319> for<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.740> students<00:05:31.280> to

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
what we're aiming for the students to

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:43.809 
what we're aiming for the students to
use<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:41.630> I've<00:05:41.719> taken<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.050> time<00:05:42.319> to<00:05:42.789> do<00:05:43.789> a

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
use so I've taken the time to do a

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.570 
use so I've taken the time to do a
demonstration<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.990> have<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.590> piece<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:46.009> work

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
demonstration I have a piece of work

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.379 
demonstration I have a piece of work
using<00:05:47.240> inspiration<00:05:48.050> from<00:05:48.560> Ben<00:05:48.770> quilty<00:05:49.190> as<00:05:50.090> you

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
using inspiration from Ben quilty as you

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.149 
using inspiration from Ben quilty as you
can<00:05:50.539> see<00:05:51.279> you<00:05:52.279> can't<00:05:52.550> see<00:05:52.789> this<00:05:53.210> is<00:05:53.449> a<00:05:54.159> painting

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
can see you can't see this is a painting
