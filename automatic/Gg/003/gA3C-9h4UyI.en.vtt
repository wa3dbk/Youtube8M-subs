00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.710
 goodnight users today they 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.210
 let's teach how to add a channel 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.280
 privately to his rock or a channel basically 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.620
 there are two channels right now in the red 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.140
 the first one is through chat 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.400
 in the same rock you access the menu 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.650
 main and you can add the 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.759
 only channels of red however not 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.619
 they can do the same with the channels 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.560
 Private private channels require 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.409
 of a code and that code is unique 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.140
 it is very likely that they will not find it in 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.059
 any site 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.559
 on the internet there are many sites that have 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.210
 lists of private rock channels 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.129
 you just put in google search 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.199
 rock a driver chan hol and if they can 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.970
 find a quantity a website that 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.190
 details that we are going to have a 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.440
 channel a website forgiveness that has the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.130
 Private channels of red listed in a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.140
 organized 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.000
 and come on sir he had the simple way of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.610
 add this to you years and from your 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.910
 red user account on the internet 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.990
 you have to enter here on your page 11 the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.930
 dot dot red dot 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.140
 you go in they were going to get in way 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140
 private 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.159
 and here he says to me I have to add the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.100
 code to add a private channel like this 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.720
 that I go not well the website says 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.080
 rocco try you can not see what is 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.400
 a geek point tv a channel a website 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.930
 that has a detailed list of 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.860
 channels we are going to look for them by categories 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.180
 let's add let's say 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.180
 one that has to m 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.170
 sports and what is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.170
 yes 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170
 4 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.120
 a moment 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.910
 on live Tv 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.640
 can see that in l'aquila says if they are 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.469
 free and carry some kind of charge and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.539
 there is a rating the people in Bogota say with 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.060
 this channel I like is that there is not all 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.650
 a series of interesting things 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.090
 it would be a lot about what there is not 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.129
 a channel 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.129
 in the station 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 traffic 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.239
 we have the air of turn 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.239
 let's add some wings 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.610
 let's see this sport why 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.569
 clique amos 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.569
 the lynxes good 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.400
 because this is a Russian channel 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.380
 apparently so if we put on 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.590
 here but I the person the person gives 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.800
 more copy the code to feel more 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.720
 sure we already know that he goes here like this 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.590
 that we're going here and we 're going to copy everything 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.540
 this month here 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 you can see add channel 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.270
 and it's ready tell me it's content 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.700
 free however perhaps part of the 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.680
 content carries some charges so 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.860
 If I want to add it, I give them to 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.750
 add channel and bathed I'm not interested 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.360
 so let's find another one because we see 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.930
 that can have some charges let's go 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.930
 category 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.640
 internet was for anyone 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.840
 or 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.840
 break 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.950
 we added the dell channel 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.870
 but nothing many votes 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.780
 and good this one of videojuegos we are going to 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.780
 give it to the channel and ign so to speak 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.660
 someone 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.710
 and we're going to add the free we're going to 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.710
 Add 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.689
 this can take up to 24 hours in 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:29.699
 appear is the way we're going to 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.259
 add another way to do it is in the 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.200
 same website as we are in our 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.330
 account we go to channels 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.580
 are the channels that are in sites of 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.620
 reds and public channels and we can 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.669
 let's go find blogs 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.669
 to see what works 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.770

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.130
 we are seeing the chat the author those who 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.280
 they have the hooks are the channels that 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:07.180
 I already have added in my red 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.310
 I want to add some other 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.310
 this slip was split in mestalla 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.550

 to see this is the extreme green that brings 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.599

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:50.340

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.729
 complication with just one click is 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.870
