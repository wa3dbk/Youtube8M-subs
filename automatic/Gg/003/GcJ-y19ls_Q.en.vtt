along<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.179> top<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.439> thin

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
along the top it's not just some thin

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.209

will happen see that that is what

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.310 
will happen see that that is what
happens<00:01:41.729> within<00:01:41.909> four<00:01:42.240> gearboxes<00:01:42.810> version

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
happens within four gearboxes version

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.050 
happens within four gearboxes version
tubes<00:01:43.560> any<00:01:43.920> version<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.270> happen

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
tubes any version to this will happen

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.850 
tubes any version to this will happen
see<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> huge<00:01:48.899> crack<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.560> break

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
see that that's a huge crack I can break

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.240 
see that that's a huge crack I can break
this<00:01:50.040> off<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:51.439> see<00:01:52.439> there's<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.799> there's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
this off and see there's just there's

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
this off and see there's just there's
not<00:01:53.430> enough<00:01:53.700> reinforcement<00:01:54.299> along<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> top

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
not enough reinforcement along the top

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.190 
not enough reinforcement along the top
is<00:01:55.409> compared<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> Version<00:01:56.340> three

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
is compared to Version three

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.789 
is compared to Version three
you<00:01:58.189> have<00:01:58.340> tons<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.789> reinforcements<00:01:59.799> like

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
you have tons of reinforcements like

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.340 
you have tons of reinforcements like
it's<00:02:01.219> just<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.450> way<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:02.990> was<00:02:03.140> designed

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's just the way that this was designed

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.109 
it's just the way that this was designed
is<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:03.829> much<00:02:03.950> better<00:02:04.070> another<00:02:04.789> reason<00:02:04.969> why<00:02:05.060> I

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
is so much better another reason why I

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.550 
is so much better another reason why I
don't<00:02:05.329> like<00:02:05.450> enforce<00:02:05.929> because<00:02:06.049> their<00:02:06.350> hop-up

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
don't like enforce because their hop-up

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.960 
don't like enforce because their hop-up
units<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.530> they<00:02:09.530> can't<00:02:10.009> they're<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.580> meant<00:02:10.849> to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
units so they can't they're not meant to

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.940 
units so they can't they're not meant to
be<00:02:11.090> made<00:02:11.420> accurate<00:02:11.900> they're<00:02:12.110> meant<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.739> an

be made accurate they're meant to be an
assault<00:02:13.370> weapon<00:02:14.090> I've<00:02:14.630> got<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.110> case<00:02:15.380> that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
assault weapon I've got a case that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.740 
assault weapon I've got a case that
urges<00:02:16.040> stalk<00:02:16.519> accuracy<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:18.519> just<00:02:19.519> dead-on

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
urges stalk accuracy just just dead-on

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.589 
urges stalk accuracy just just dead-on
like<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.590> can't<00:02:21.980> make<00:02:22.280> an<00:02:22.580> m4<00:02:23.030> more<00:02:23.209> accurate

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
like you can't make an m4 more accurate

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.860 
like you can't make an m4 more accurate
than<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.930> game<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:25.660> would<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.810> to

better it's like if you're going for

going to excel even in accuracy it's

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
going to excel even in accuracy it's
just<00:03:23.930> how<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.200> is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
just how it is

one<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.100> drawbacks<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> naked<00:03:26.329> gearbox

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
one of the drawbacks to a naked gearbox

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.240 
one of the drawbacks to a naked gearbox
is<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:27.920> no<00:03:28.459> room<00:03:28.730> for<00:03:28.870> wiring<00:03:30.250> harnesses

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
is you have no room for wiring harnesses

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.099 
is you have no room for wiring harnesses
it's<00:03:31.579> kind<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.000> lame<00:03:32.180> because<00:03:32.630> if<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.900> see

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
it's kind of lame because if you see

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.379 
it's kind of lame because if you see
here<00:03:33.410> there's<00:03:34.190> not<00:03:34.310> enough<00:03:34.549> room<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.819> put<00:03:35.239> a

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
here there's not enough room to put a

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.039 
here there's not enough room to put a
MOSFET<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.760> literally<00:03:38.180> I've<00:03:38.450> tried

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
MOSFET so I have to literally I've tried

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.140 
MOSFET so I have to literally I've tried
it's<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.560> hard<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.370> do<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:40.880> just<00:03:40.970> a

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
it's so hard you can do it it's just a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.059 
it's so hard you can do it it's just a
pain<00:03:41.389> it's<00:03:42.109> not<00:03:42.260> really<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.560> part<00:03:42.769> just<00:03:42.859> make

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
pain it's not really that part just make

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.099 
pain it's not really that part just make
it<00:03:43.160> sound<00:03:43.310> bad<00:03:43.489> but<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.359> can<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.810> it's<00:03:44.930> just

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
it sound bad but you can do it it's just

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.900 
it sound bad but you can do it it's just
