basically what I've got today is a new

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.089 
basically what I've got today is a new
turn<00:00:08.730> signal<00:00:09.120> relay<00:00:09.330> flasher<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.170> bought<00:00:10.920> this

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
turn signal relay flasher I bought this

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.100 
turn signal relay flasher I bought this
from<00:00:11.250> auto<00:00:11.490> winter<00:00:11.790> calm<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.870> called

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
from auto winter calm and it's called

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.670 
from auto winter calm and it's called
tap<00:00:13.469> turn<00:00:14.030> essentially<00:00:15.080> it<00:00:16.080> allows<00:00:16.230> me<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> use

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
tap turn essentially it allows me to use

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.150 
tap turn essentially it allows me to use
LED<00:00:17.390> turn<00:00:18.390> signal<00:00:18.690> bulbs<00:00:18.990> without<00:00:19.350> needing

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
LED turn signal bulbs without needing

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.849 
LED turn signal bulbs without needing
resistors<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.029> anything<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.590> gives<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
resistors or anything and it gives you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.290 
resistors or anything and it gives you
some<00:00:23.010> other<00:00:23.070> cool<00:00:23.310> features<00:00:23.670> which<00:00:23.850> I'll<00:00:24.029> show

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
some other cool features which I'll show

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.330 
some other cool features which I'll show
you<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.630> minute<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:26.180> turn<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.570> car

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
you here in a minute so turn on the car

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.220 
you here in a minute so turn on the car
basically<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.880> mode<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> use

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
basically just on mode and then if I use

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.180 
basically just on mode and then if I use
the<00:00:31.500> signal<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:33.050> no<00:00:34.050> flat<00:00:34.469> no<00:00:34.890> fast

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the signal you see no flat no fast

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
the signal you see no flat no fast
blinking<00:00:35.640> they're<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.780> regular<00:00:36.930> blinks<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
blinking they're just regular blinks of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.510 
blinking they're just regular blinks of
course<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.059> brought<00:00:39.120> LEDs<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.719> around<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> it's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
course I brought LEDs all around so it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.930 
course I brought LEDs all around so it's
required<00:00:41.910> sorry<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:44.010> basically<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.520> signal

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
required sorry but basically this signal

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
required sorry but basically this signal
this<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.719> tap<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> relay<00:00:47.250> thing

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
this this tap this is a relay thing

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.959 
this this tap this is a relay thing
gives<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.860> tap<00:00:49.860> turn<00:00:50.160> which<00:00:50.370> means<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.789> can

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
gives me a tap turn which means I can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
gives me a tap turn which means I can
just<00:00:51.120> tap<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> signals<00:00:51.930> lock<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
just tap the signals lock and I get a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.090 
just tap the signals lock and I get a
set<00:00:53.190> number<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> blanks<00:00:54.140> which<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> set<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> 3

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
set number of blanks which is set to 3

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
set number of blanks which is set to 3
by<00:00:56.309> default<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.360> left<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.710> get

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
by default so left or right you just get

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
by default so left or right you just get
three<00:00:59.190> flags<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.050> changing

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
three flags so this is like for changing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
three flags so this is like for changing
lanes<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.680> whatever<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
lanes or whatever and if you want just

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.460 
lanes or whatever and if you want just
one<00:01:03.449> blink<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.080> hold<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> down<00:01:04.409> for

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
one blink you can just hold it down for

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980 
one blink you can just hold it down for
one<00:01:04.799> blink<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:05.970> blink<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
one blink and you get one blink or you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.200 
one blink and you get one blink or you
know<00:01:07.110> -<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> real

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
know - but then you just do it real

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.010 
know - but then you just do it real
quickly<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:09.990> three<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.670> I'm

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
quickly and you get three so now I'm

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.380 
quickly and you get three so now I'm
kind<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> OCD<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:14.460> kind<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.729> musical<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
kind of OCD and also kind of musical and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.179 
kind of OCD and also kind of musical and
I<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.900> four<00:01:16.140> before<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.860> makes<00:01:16.979> sense

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
I just like four before it makes sense

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.100 
I just like four before it makes sense
to<00:01:17.280> me<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> change<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> four

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
to me so I'm going to change it to four

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.210 
to me so I'm going to change it to four
and<00:01:19.200> I'll<00:01:19.290> show<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> how<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> turn<00:01:20.100> off

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and I'll show you how to get it turn off

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.600 
and I'll show you how to get it turn off
the<00:01:20.340> car<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.409> off<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the car and now that it's off if you do

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
the car and now that it's off if you do
the<00:01:23.729> signal<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> tap<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> signal<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> get

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the signal if you tap the signal you get

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.620 
the signal if you tap the signal you get
hazards<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> tells<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
hazards and what it tells you now is it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
hazards and what it tells you now is it
blink<00:01:27.900> three<00:01:28.140> times<00:01:28.170> between<00:01:28.560> sets<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
blink three times between sets of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.560 
blink three times between sets of
setting<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.490> three<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.110> up

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
setting for three so if I want to go up

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.880 
setting for three so if I want to go up
to<00:01:33.570> four<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:34.500> hit<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to four I have to basically hit the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.280 
to four I have to basically hit the
switch<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.840> been<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> wall

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
switch up so now that it's been the wall

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
switch up so now that it's been the wall
it<00:01:37.439> has<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> twice<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.610> hit<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.509> one

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it has to do it twice so I hit that one

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.390 
it has to do it twice so I hit that one
just<00:01:39.900> shows<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.470> three<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
just shows me it's at three and then I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.600 
just shows me it's at three and then I
have<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> again<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.189> there<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.430> now

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
have to do it again and there we go now

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
have to do it again and there we go now
it's<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.850> four<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.840> set<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> from

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it's at four and you can set it from

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.190 
it's at four and you can set it from
between<00:01:46.560> three<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:46.890> six<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.840> forest

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
between three and six but I think forest

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.289 
between three and six but I think forest
perfect<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.710> me<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.729> turn<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.000> car<00:01:51.119> by

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
perfect for me now if I turn the car by

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
perfect for me now if I turn the car by
go<00:01:51.450> on

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.970 

now<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.730> can<00:01:54.910> just<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.560> tap<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:56.800> that

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
now I can just like it tap it like that

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.210 
now I can just like it tap it like that
and<00:01:57.760> we<00:01:57.820> get<00:01:58.090> four<00:01:58.330> blanks<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:59.500> that's<00:01:59.680> pretty

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
and we get four blanks so that's pretty

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.980 
and we get four blanks so that's pretty
cool<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.580> that's<00:02:00.670> actually<00:02:00.910> kind<00:02:01.150> of<00:02:01.240> fun<00:02:01.480> so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.060 

but<00:02:04.990> then<00:02:05.080> at<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.230> same<00:02:05.320> time<00:02:05.500> one<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
but then at the same time one of the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.620 
but then at the same time one of the
other<00:02:06.190> cool<00:02:06.400> things<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.640> we'll<00:02:06.820> do<00:02:06.940> which<00:02:07.510> we

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
other cool things that we'll do which we

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.120 
other cool things that we'll do which we
don't<00:02:07.810> need<00:02:07.900> on<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:09.430> has<00:02:09.610> hazard<00:02:10.090> mode<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:11.130> if

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
don't need on it has hazard mode and if

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.790 
don't need on it has hazard mode and if
you<00:02:12.310> switch<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.110> stock<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.440> way<00:02:14.560> or<00:02:14.710> the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
you switch the stock one way or the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.470 
you switch the stock one way or the
other<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.100> get<00:02:15.220> two<00:02:15.400> separate<00:02:15.730> modes<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.330> this

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
other you get two separate modes so this

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.840 
other you get two separate modes so this
is<00:02:16.600> normal<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.140> put<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.740> left<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.670> goes

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
is normal if I put it on left it goes

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.870 
is normal if I put it on left it goes
into<00:02:19.090> slow<00:02:19.330> mode<00:02:19.540> which<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.440> half<00:02:20.590> speed<00:02:20.920> which

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
into slow mode which is half speed which

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
into slow mode which is half speed which
I<00:02:21.970> mean<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.210> guess<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.480> different<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.560> then

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
I mean I guess is different but then

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.200 
I mean I guess is different but then
what<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.830> think<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.220> cool<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.460> having<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
what I think is cool is having it in a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.880 
what I think is cool is having it in a
the<00:02:25.600> right<00:02:25.780> mode<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.290> wig<00:02:26.890> wag<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.410> mean<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the right mode is wig wag so I mean I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.020 
the right mode is wig wag so I mean I
don't<00:02:30.250> know<00:02:30.400> if<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.550> can<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.790> see<00:02:30.910> that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
don't know if you can really see that

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.650 
don't know if you can really see that
it's<00:02:31.390> kind<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.780> washed<00:02:31.990> out<00:02:32.140> looking<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.340> I

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
it's kind of washed out looking but I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
it's kind of washed out looking but I
don't<00:02:34.660> know<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.780> think<00:02:35.020> that's<00:02:35.170> cool<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:36.070> then

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
don't know I think that's cool so then

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.250 
don't know I think that's cool so then
that's<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:37.000> by<00:02:37.270> switching<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.750> stock<00:02:37.960> one<00:02:38.110> way

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
that's just by switching a stock one way

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.690 
that's just by switching a stock one way
or<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.410> other<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.770> can<00:02:38.950> change<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.280> any<00:02:39.490> mode

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
or the other you can change it any mode

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.410 
or the other you can change it any mode
so<00:02:40.210> that's<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.570> easy

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
so that's really easy

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.570 
so that's really easy
remember<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.840> then<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:45.070> bought<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
remember that and then this I bought the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.870 
remember that and then this I bought the
optional<00:02:46.120> strobe<00:02:46.900> pack<00:02:47.320> which<00:02:48.130> basically<00:02:48.520> can

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
optional strobe pack which basically can

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.100 
optional strobe pack which basically can
add<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> strobe<00:02:49.630> effect<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.350> any<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:52.110> DeMott

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
add a strobe effect to any of the DeMott

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.450 
add a strobe effect to any of the DeMott
the<00:02:53.320> modes<00:02:53.530> which<00:02:53.740> I've<00:02:53.920> shown<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.430> far

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
the modes which I've shown you so far

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.310 
the modes which I've shown you so far
either<00:02:54.730> them<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.270> Havard<00:02:55.660> any<00:02:55.960> of<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.140> three

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
either them to Havard any of the three

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.800 
either them to Havard any of the three
hazards<00:02:56.680> or<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.130> signals<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.810> personally

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
hazards or the signals I personally

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.180 
hazards or the signals I personally
don't<00:02:58.959> really<00:02:59.020> want<00:02:59.290> my<00:02:59.380> signals<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.950> strobe

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
don't really want my signals to strobe

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.490 
don't really want my signals to strobe
all<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> time<00:03:00.640> but<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.850> think<00:03:00.970> maybe<00:03:01.410> having<00:03:02.410> a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
all the time but I think maybe having a

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.430 
all the time but I think maybe having a
hazard<00:03:02.890> store<00:03:03.160> would<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.430> cool<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.600> I'm

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
hazard store would be cool so I'm

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.510 
hazard store would be cool so I'm
looking<00:03:05.739> at<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> instructions<00:03:06.370> here

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
looking at the instructions here

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.090 
looking at the instructions here
basically<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.150> have<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.420> change<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.100> strobe

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
basically I have to change it to strobe

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.310 
basically I have to change it to strobe
mode<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.720> off<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.170> says<00:03:12.060> turn<00:03:13.320> to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
mode so now that it off it says turn to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.050 
mode so now that it off it says turn to
the<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.590> position<00:03:14.620> which<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.550> using<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.239> key

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.950 

okay<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.180> then<00:03:20.300> put<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.600> write<00:03:20.930> mode<00:03:21.340> and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
okay and then put it in write mode and

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.690 
okay and then put it in write mode and
then<00:03:23.960> put<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.920> hazards<00:03:27.520> wig<00:03:28.520> leg

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
then put it on the hazards wig leg

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.470 
then put it on the hazards wig leg
begins<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.330> couldn't<00:03:29.660> read<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.900> off<00:03:31.330> there<00:03:32.330> we

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
begins I couldn't read it off there we

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.250 
begins I couldn't read it off there we
go<00:03:32.690> check<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.560> out<00:03:33.740> I<00:03:34.930> think<00:03:35.930> that's<00:03:36.110> just

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
go check that out I think that's just

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.530 
go check that out I think that's just
funny<00:03:38.740> kind<00:03:39.740> of<00:03:39.770> annoying<00:03:40.040> sounding<00:03:40.460> but<00:03:41.210> but

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
funny kind of annoying sounding but but

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.470 
funny kind of annoying sounding but but
well<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:43.340> has<00:03:43.580> several<00:03:43.790> modes<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.300> can

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
well and this has several modes you can

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.570 
well and this has several modes you can
switch<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.290> do<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:45.860> it's<00:03:46.010> on

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
switch you can do it so that it's on

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.760 
switch you can do it so that it's on
so<00:03:46.850> it<00:03:47.150> only<00:03:47.300> strobes<00:03:47.870> when<00:03:48.080> you're<00:03:48.200> Park<00:03:48.500> and

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
so it only strobes when you're Park and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.500 
so it only strobes when you're Park and
then<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.640> next<00:03:49.850> mode<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.210> throw<00:03:50.450> this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
then the next mode is you throw this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.180 
then the next mode is you throw this
when<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:50.990> parked<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.530> when<00:03:51.860> it's<00:03:51.980> driving

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
when it's parked or when it's driving

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.610 
when it's parked or when it's driving
and<00:03:52.550> then<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.060> final<00:03:53.390> mode<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.780> strobing<00:03:54.440> on

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
and then the final mode is strobing on

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.210 
and then the final mode is strobing on
all<00:03:55.210> foot<00:03:56.210> hazard<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.960> signals<00:03:57.890> because<00:03:58.070> like

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
all foot hazard and signals because like

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.640 
all foot hazard and signals because like
right<00:03:58.370> now<00:03:58.520> if<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.820> were<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.000> turn<00:03:59.150> her<00:03:59.270> on<00:04:05.650> see

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
right now if I were to turn her on see

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.370 
right now if I were to turn her on see
the<00:04:06.770> car<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.150> stopped<00:04:08.390> strobing<00:04:08.900> so

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
the car is on so it stopped strobing so

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.660 
the car is on so it stopped strobing so
if<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.530> want<00:04:09.710> to<00:04:09.740> make<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.520> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
if I want to make it so that it's in the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.190 
if I want to make it so that it's in the
next<00:04:10.820> mode<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.210> to<00:04:11.420> basically<00:04:11.600> do<00:04:11.960> that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
next mode I have to basically do that

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.950 
next mode I have to basically do that
tap<00:04:12.500> dance<00:04:12.740> again<00:04:13.100> which<00:04:13.550> I<00:04:13.930> guess<00:04:14.930> is

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
tap dance again which I guess is

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.080 
tap dance again which I guess is
probably<00:04:15.350> just<00:04:18.430> trimming<00:04:19.430> off<00:04:19.580> the<00:04:19.610> Heather's

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
probably just trimming off the Heather's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:28.320 
probably just trimming off the Heather's
and<00:04:20.299> then<00:04:20.390> turning<00:04:20.600> back<00:04:20.810> on<00:04:20.989> hazards<00:04:21.880> no

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.570 

let's<00:04:28.659> see

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.010 

right<00:04:33.180> right<00:04:34.070> on<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:36.650> then<00:04:37.650> off<00:04:38.600> there<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:39.690> is

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
right right on and then off there it is

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.040 
right right on and then off there it is
so<00:04:40.800> now<00:04:40.950> if<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.130> put<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.370> on<00:04:41.490> on<00:04:41.730> mode<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.900> should

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
so now if I put it on on mode it should

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.500 
so now if I put it on on mode it should
keep<00:04:43.260> strobing<00:04:43.710> okay<00:04:44.340> there<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.580> go<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.390> this

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
keep strobing okay there we go so this

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.540 
keep strobing okay there we go so this
is<00:04:45.660> mode<00:04:45.870> see<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.920> were<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.130> do<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.250> again

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
is mode see if I were to do it again

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.200 
is mode see if I were to do it again
then<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.690> signals<00:04:49.440> would<00:04:49.590> also<00:04:49.800> flash<00:04:50.310> but

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
then the signals would also flash but

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.460 
then the signals would also flash but
because<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.570> don't<00:04:51.720> want<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.900> do<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.140> you<00:04:52.290> see

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
because I don't want to do that you see

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.170 
because I don't want to do that you see
I<00:04:52.500> just<00:04:52.590> have<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:53.010> signal<00:04:53.580> mode<00:04:53.730> it's<00:04:53.970> not

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
I just have it on signal mode it's not

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.390 
I just have it on signal mode it's not
strobing<00:04:54.540> anymore<00:04:54.900> but<00:04:55.170> then<00:04:55.350> heather<00:04:56.130> mode

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
strobing anymore but then heather mode

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.850 
strobing anymore but then heather mode
it<00:04:56.550> will<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:57.360> course<00:04:57.570> I've<00:04:58.110> got<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.560> switch

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
it will and of course I've got to switch

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.880 
it will and of course I've got to switch
on<00:04:59.100> in<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.370> right<00:04:59.550> mode<00:04:59.760> if<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.150> put<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.420> in<00:05:00.890> the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
on in the right mode if I put it in the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.950 
on in the right mode if I put it in the
regular<00:05:02.280> mode<00:05:02.430> it'll<00:05:02.670> just<00:05:02.910> scrub<00:05:03.300> the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
regular mode it'll just scrub the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.450 
regular mode it'll just scrub the
regular<00:05:04.320> hazards<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.220> then<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.430> course

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
regular hazards and then of course

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.060 
regular hazards and then of course
putting<00:05:05.760> it<00:05:05.910> left<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.330> for<00:05:07.050> strobes<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.800> slow

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
putting it left is for strobes and slow

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.410 
putting it left is for strobes and slow
mode<00:05:10.280> but<00:05:11.280> that's<00:05:11.790> pretty<00:05:11.970> much<00:05:12.090> what<00:05:12.330> this

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
mode but that's pretty much what this

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.670 
mode but that's pretty much what this
thing<00:05:12.660> does<00:05:12.810> so<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:13.200> think<00:05:13.350> we're<00:05:13.500> gonna<00:05:13.590> have

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
thing does so I think we're gonna have

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.530 
thing does so I think we're gonna have
some<00:05:13.740> fun<00:05:13.980> with<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.190> if<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.150> can<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:15.300> get<00:05:15.480> out

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
some fun with it if I can just get out

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.220 
some fun with it if I can just get out
here<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:17.570> shape<00:05:18.570> but<00:05:18.600> this<00:05:18.870> looks<00:05:19.080> like

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
here and shape but this looks like

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:28.460 
here and shape but this looks like
really<00:05:19.500> quick<00:05:25.760> there<00:05:26.760> we<00:05:26.850> go<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.600> don't<00:05:28.260> know

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
really quick there we go so I don't know

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.810 
really quick there we go so I don't know
that<00:05:28.500> might<00:05:28.770> be<00:05:28.920> cool<00:05:29.540> some<00:05:30.540> point
