00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
countries and yet that kind of shows you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.680 
countries and yet that kind of shows you
know<00:04:36.770> how<00:04:37.100> there<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.460> like<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.880> gap<00:04:38.300> between

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
know how there is like that gap between

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.490 
know how there is like that gap between
socioeconomic<00:04:39.620> classes<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:41.240> are

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
socioeconomic classes but you you are

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.430 
socioeconomic classes but you you are
one<00:04:42.500> who<00:04:42.650> sells<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.460> proud<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:43.790> has<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> great

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
one who sells and proud and has a great

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.850 
one who sells and proud and has a great
sales<00:04:45.580> record<00:04:46.580> with<00:04:47.030> toms<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.140> then<00:04:48.260> also<00:04:48.440> is
