00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
ass at a quarter pipe and only go you

people<00:00:53.079> go<00:00:53.289> slower<00:00:53.589> than<00:00:53.829> that<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.489> know

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
people go slower than that and you know

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.729 
people go slower than that and you know

go twice as high it's just all about how
you<00:00:56.800> pump<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.339> quarter<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:58.390> whenever<00:00:58.749> you're

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
you pump the quarter so whenever you're

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.000 
you pump the quarter so whenever you're
first<00:00:59.079> starting<00:00:59.379> out<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.589> might<00:00:59.620> want<00:00:59.859> to<00:00:59.890> go

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
first starting out you might want to go

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.000 
first starting out you might want to go
fast<00:01:00.399> enough<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.960> pretty<00:01:01.960> much<00:01:02.050> do<00:01:02.230> like<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.410> fly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
fast enough to pretty much do like a fly

out onto the deck you know like fast
enough<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.530> where<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:05.740> keep<00:01:05.980> your<00:01:06.100> feet

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.160 
you hit like your front wheel hits the
very<00:01:15.070> bottom<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.390> transition<00:01:16.990> you'll

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
very bottom of the transition you'll

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.960 
very bottom of the transition you'll
almost<00:01:17.500> want<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.710> try<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.980> manual<00:01:18.610> all<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.880> way

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
almost want to try to manual all the way

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.790 
almost want to try to manual all the way
up<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.360> quarter<00:01:19.960> pipe<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.230> you<00:01:20.500> won't<00:01:20.590> pull

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
up the quarter pipe is you won't pull

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.080 
up the quarter pipe is you won't pull
back<00:01:20.920> hard<00:01:21.160> enough<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.460> actually<00:01:21.640> pick<00:01:21.970> your

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
going to be in the back wheel and that's

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.300 
going to be in the back wheel and that's
where<00:01:28.660> all<00:01:28.870> your<00:01:29.320> pop<00:01:29.530> will<00:01:29.740> come<00:01:29.890> from<00:01:30.040> is

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
where all your pop will come from is

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.920 
where all your pop will come from is
whenever<00:01:30.610> your<00:01:30.760> back<00:01:30.970> wheel<00:01:31.180> actually<00:01:31.450> hits

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
whenever your back wheel actually hits

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.570 
whenever your back wheel actually hits
the<00:01:32.020> coping<00:01:32.500> because<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.130> lot<00:01:33.370> of<00:01:33.400> people
