 main aspects to start 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.790
 work on the plot of the novel as well 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.710
 that if you think we start right now 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.050
 seeing the summary in the first place

 below we have the following 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.260
 sections remember the topics of your 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.320
 novel the common thread and the three 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 essential parts of every novel writes 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.470
 the facts that you've already thought about organizes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.750
 the facts and create paths between them 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.969
 fill and complete values ​​and corrects what 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.370
 necessary and finally a section 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.989
 called do not be overwhelmed I hope that you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.520
 has become clear and we started the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.790
 explanation I hope you like it and I 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790
 serve 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.260
 this just wants to be a little notice 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 Think before you start preparing 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 the plot will surely have many 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.890
 ideas in your head that you should have in 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.710
 account and it's not a matter of being overwhelmed 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 but to take it easy try 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.950
 be calm and if possible not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.770
 I interrupt you while you work on this 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.450
 before you start take some time to 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.149
 think about the topics that you had chosen 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.009
 to transmit throughout your novel 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.719
 think of them as a message or a 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.030
 moral what do you want to get to 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.490
 your readers get a good look at them 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.090
 feel them and stay with them well 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.090
 entrenched 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.490
 be clear the idea of ​​your novel the 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.360
 remember is one that responds to the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.610
 question what your novel is about with this 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.220
 clear idea in your mind write a 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 summary text explaining introduction 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.310
 knot and denouement to do this you can 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.960
 help you from the plot you already had 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.370
 thought for your protagonist and that 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.880
 It will be reflected in your tab 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.880
 character 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.470
 select some facts that you already have 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.489
 thought to include in the plot of your novel 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.470
 including knot intro and denouement 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.260
 add if you do not have some twists yet 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.630
 that is, unexpected events that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.310
 change the course of the plot I leave you a 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.019
 couple of examples of pretty good turns 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.750
 of the film world although both are 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.150
 adaptations of novels in the beginning 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.819
 from ben-hur a tile accidentally falls 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.800
 from home and the life of ben hur and his 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.019
 family will change radically because 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.610
 of this fact another very good turn 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.620
 appears at the end of the language of 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.239
 butterflies' but you will have to see it or 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.860
 read the book that inspired the pencil 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.860
 of the carpenter to see it 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.019
 place all these actions in an order 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.000
 approximate chronological imagine that they are 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.859
 islands between which you must create bridges 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.840
 or navigate to them 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.239
 think about how your 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.730
 characters from one action to another how are you going 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.459
 to take them there remember that it is 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.230
 important that they reach those points of 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.359
 consistent with the background you've 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.370
 created for them help yourself from this 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.150
 background and the plots that you had 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.150
 designed for them 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.239
 adds to this development the plots 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.549
 secondary that you had thought for the 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.519
 co-stars or secondary if that 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.260
 you have not been able to do it yet 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.730
 secondary frames can be the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.390
 perfect tool to fill 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 some holes 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.860
 write your whole plot on paper in 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.590
 chronological order once you have this 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.470
 complete schematic plot makes the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.570
 following questions 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.400
 fits with my initial idea of ​​a novel 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.500
 it can be appreciated comes the common thread 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.300
 It will reflect well the topics you wanted 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.400
 transmit there are others which 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.980
 the actions of the characters are 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.690
 coherent with his personality have 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.990
 Evolved the characters of the form 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.990
 expected 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.350
 choose which of the answers to these 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.210
 questions are not satisfactory 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.910
 to be able to correct them by going back to 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.050
 work on the plot for example is 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.690
 possible that although the common thread 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.040
 be clear it is not the same but 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.540
 you want this to be the new thread 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.240
 driver of the novel and discard the 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.240
 previous the decision is in your hands 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.470
 this is just the first scheme of the 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.479
 plot of your novel is fine that you 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.430
 it is satisfactory but it is possible 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.160
 that once you start writing the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.810
 novel keep changing the things have 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.030
 always the essential thing in terms of 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.860
 coherence and messages to be transmitted but 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.560
 also let yourself be carried away by the writing 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.650
 many times the actions will flow by themselves 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.419
 very agile very well this is 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.099

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.150
 development of your plot at least 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.949
 in these general aspects of 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.570
