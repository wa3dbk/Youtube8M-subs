00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
the grocery store but I pretty much

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.460 
the grocery store but I pretty much

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
stuck to it for the most part maybe not

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.050 
stuck to it for the most part maybe not
towards<00:07:07.800> the<00:07:07.830> end<00:07:08.040> but<00:07:08.250> I<00:07:08.460> didn't<00:07:08.910> get<00:07:08.970> a

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
towards the end but I didn't get a

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
pineapple or a watermelon instead and I

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.070 
pineapple or a watermelon instead and I
didn't<00:07:11.790> get<00:07:11.880> asparagus<00:07:12.360> because<00:07:12.750> it<00:07:12.870> was<00:07:12.960> like

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
didn't get asparagus because it was like

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.000
