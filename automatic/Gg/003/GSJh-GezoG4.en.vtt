00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
 but now to the latest events on 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.430
 Ukraine in Donetsk now evaluate 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.460
 consequences of shelling by security forces 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
 chemical plant and now working there 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 our special correspondent nikolay 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.929
 Dolgachev he visited the site of the explosion and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 can contact us right now 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.869
 Nikolay hello tell that you 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 have seen u love you we have been to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.539
 the epicenter of the diameter bang tactical 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
 rockets. saw a huge funnel not 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.059
 less than ten meters deep in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.640
 about 50 meters in diameter to examine 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.660
 detail no no it was difficult because 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 continued shelling 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.010
 mines obviously Ukrainian military 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 tried to prevent appearances there 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 professionals and journalists but i watch 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.980
 do not fuel the place of this blast on 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.309
 policy at the plant pommel 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.289
 which are currently not working 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.250
 because for a long time are 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.500
 actually at the forefront on 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.630
 front 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 hits because we saw was 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 the outskirts of this on this territory 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.280
 but less than a kilometer away there is no 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.920
 residential buildings 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.780
 this territory of the city or right on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 Donetsk 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.210
 maybe on a mission differently or 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.030
 some rooms and warehouses but a funnel 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.189
 huge there is practically nothing 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.890
 all left is not arranged black land 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:43.409
 a burning smell was burning 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.470
 high temperature was apparently 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.479
 now there is won there 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 specialists they discover meter from 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.049
 trying to find real 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.880
 evidence to find fragments of debris 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.420
 ammunition which which was about 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.900
 judging by the nature of the funnel by nature 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.930
 destruction from the terrain 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:11.540
 Obviously, this is a powerful ammunition. 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.030
 and and me about a ton and TNT 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.340
 equivalent 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.480
 untwisted forest which brought and which 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.760
 near there are mixtures it is just like how 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.810
 matches broken trees for enough 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.810
 long distance but heard in Donetsk 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.410
 not only bad little golden take off 50 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.190
 kilometers from the epicenter areas which 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.910
 closer and adjacent to this place in homes 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 windows were broken seen and heard 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.380
 almost all in Donetsk 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.980
 Seen who not kicked enjoy 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.970
 almost all will see the city and 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.209
 Now they think they visited the site despite 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.450
 on what still leads 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.370
 and apply and only mortars in this 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.780
 area 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.080
 ukrainian military beauty jet 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.310
 volley fire systems hail and hurricane 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.820
 we saw thirds of these rockets a territory 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.030
 around 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.430
 strewn with fragments here when we were leaving 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.440
 from here the wheels roamed because 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.720
 a lot of fragments are simply impossible 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.580
 drive up now almost have a video 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.140
 evidence of the use of such a powerful 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.100
 ammunition under the city of Donetsk Olga 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.870
 Nikolaev talk about very 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.600
 serious damage but at the same time 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.100
 reportedly avoided 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.630
 environmental releases of some kind 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.230
 harmful substances and in doing so succeeded 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.690
 to avoid 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.810
 dead how to do it. 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.370
 fell on the territory that here 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.070
 nobody went at this moment and not 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.570
 the litany of the factory is not some kind of wagons 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.600
 some sort of storage space from it 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.100
 nothing left no chemical 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.920
 reagents here is there was 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:10.269
 confirmed by our experts if only 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.430
 have sex quarters destruction would have 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.200
 catastrophically more but this is the outskirts 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.010
 Donetsk and to Russian 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.530
 houses 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.810
 who were close to the epicenter 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.750
 there is it less than a kilometer in them 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.130
 nobody lives now people were 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.320
 evacuated and fell so cool just 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.120
 actually passing on thanks nicholas 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.620
 Dolgachev visited the site of the explosion 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.310
 chemical enterprise 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.310
 Donetsk
