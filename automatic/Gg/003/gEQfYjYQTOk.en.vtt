00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 It hit a good appetizer for all the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.330
 only hours which is usually very 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.950
 Caloric, right?

 a delight 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.530
 bosco is a goal you can can 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.320
 follow torradinha as a cookie 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.460
 to pass on bread like on top of pasta 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.460
 It's very easy to do 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.180
 the revenues go from the most sophisticated to 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180
 more lights 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.340
 the fault of olive to tdt 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.240
 Summary of chicken, I usually buy 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 only the egg hitting that I 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.330
 like a lot is very light various pate 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.650
 of daily gorgonzola salmon 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 pore's have flavors to suit all tastes 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.590
 but the basis is almost always the same is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.900
 onézimo iron topped the cream or 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.640
 until the curd 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.370
 that is where the common danger of thinking lies 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.680
 in priests most of them are a source of 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.869
 because they are cheeses and only 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 mayonnaise that also makes it obvious that 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.100
 People also have to control fat. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.800
 that has in its base because it is this delight 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.690
 fatten a tablespoon of beating has 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.790
 about 100 calories really hit 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.090
 not fattening is fattening 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.090
 pate 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.210
 after all, is it possible to make a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.310
 mixture lighter than ever think through 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.409
 greasy I think with vegetables 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.470
 vegetables have a business of pâtés and 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.510
 especially zucchini or 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.819
 eggplant is contained lesser amount of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.920
 olive oil would be a scrape a thousand deaths it 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.110
 it was cleared it will get much less 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.459
 fat than a mayonnaise 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.950
 we can opt for a mayonnaise 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.370
 light also we can put also 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.540
 some herbs such as basil 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.530
 as parsley as celery another tip is 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.140
 keep an eye on the accompaniments 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.600
 We can lay some 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.910
 little sticks of carrot sticks 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.430
 and do not opt for just breads that often 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.470
 are watered with sesame or with a little 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.980
 of olive oil, which increased further 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.230
 plus the calorie of that preparation 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.950
 keep an eye on time to conserve 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.500
 the product to be can be from five to seven 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.060
 days of conservation because we do not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.370
 puts as much salt as a duck 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 industrialized 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.870
 the market offers a great deal 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.390
 of pates ready but there are those who prefer 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.130
 to do at home with a special touch 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.510
 Toning baptized put a little 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.090
 higher is sunless 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.010
