00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.670
 for this it will not hurt to take into account the explanations of the professor of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.240
 Human Anatomy of the University of Granada 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.259
 Miguel Guirao 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.989
 we go for it to the science park of Andalusia 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.300
 Professor is awarded 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.570
 you know that when we say the person 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.289
 he does not have a silly hair 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.140
 they do not have it either 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.949
 because our intelligence 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.349
 they are not operating 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.979
 the tendency is in the brain because if not the expensive thing they will already tell me 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.100
 so you should talk about the players are the ones who are 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.390
 two particular structures that are in our skin 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 the hairs that come from the inside and the nails 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.670
 That in 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.460
 efe d of what these tools are more distant 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.640
 they have in common the hairs and the nails are constituted by the same 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 protein that is keratin 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the same way that turtle shell is so beautiful that we have here 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.889
 ok we are fighting even these unions to explode 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.310
 but when we have them 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.770
 we have approximately 1 100 thousand pesos 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.700
 The only thing that happens is that I have my ball 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.670
 we are as tiny as the beautiful one that does not cover practically the whole body 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.110
 there are only three places where we do not have hair in an open chat in the palms 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.420
 of the hands and on the soles of the feet as you see we have three types of hair 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.180
 that we have put in this hairdresser 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.770
 and because this way 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.540
 it was because the hair 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 I do not know chucho twenty that are the hair follicles 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.929
 according to that day I went with what he spun his second test of the day 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.929
 santiago and this is the same as this pastry bag 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.420
 when I squeezed with a certain mouthpiece 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.159
 a certain form comes out 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.390
 but if I put another mouthpiece 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.620
 the form s 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.990
 to its different environment mode and one last thing 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 both the hair and the nails are dead tissues 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.530
 because if not every time we went to the hairdresser and did not cut the hair 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.220
 imagine sanctuary of lament that would be the hairdresser does not hurt but 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.289
 but nevertheless 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.450
 if we pull a hair 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.270
 yes it hurts us because 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.009
 because they are tearing the hair from the living part of the rae 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.930
 and remember that although the hair and the nail have been weakened dead 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.439
 they must take care 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.510
 We will make a new stage in this magnificent journey through our body 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.959
 human
