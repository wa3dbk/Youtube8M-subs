00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
sometimes it's important to make

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it's important to continue to create a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.260 
it's important to continue to create a
reminder<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.870> seems<00:00:46.140> let<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.070> know

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270
