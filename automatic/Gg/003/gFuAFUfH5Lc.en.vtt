00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.250
 one of Latin America the composition of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 natural numbers can be a job 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.460
 very simple if you know the order well 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 of each of the values ​​for example 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.600
 a composition would be to pass a number 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.720
 of decomposed so to speak to a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.210
 compound number 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.690
 a broken number would be that which 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 is represented by its values 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 either in units of 1000 or tens of 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.810
 thousands hundreds and so on in hundreds 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.090
 tens units 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:49.040
 for example one thousand plus 500 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.460
 + 32 is a number that is broken 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.300
 the key is to locate each one of the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.760
 values ​​in their correct position 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:06.050
 for example 1000 is going to be a unit of 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.170
 1500 will be 5 hundreds 30 will be 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.150
 three tens and two are going to be just 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.400
 two units 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.910
 now as we well know the numbers are going 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 to have all an order the unit of 1000 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.030
 will go on one side the hundred will go on 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.000
 the other followed will go the ten and for 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 last by the unit is to say these 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.970
 imaginary columns that we're going to have 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.670
 number 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.100
 they will always be in the same order 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.830
 unity tens of hundreds unity of a thousand 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 let's have then ten thousand 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.110
 hundred thousand we will reach the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.830
 unity 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.830
 of Union 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.960
 so we will be able to put together any number 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.820
 to achieve a composition of any 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.820
 natural number for example 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.530
 let's change let's put 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.530
 20,000 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.250
 plus 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.980
 400 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.790
 + 20 + 9 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.130
 here we are in another different way 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.780
 we're going to have 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.980
 2 so to speak 2 let's change 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.950
 colour 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.370
 two tens of thousands that is 20 thousand we are going to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.549
 have four hundred two dozen and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 nine units therefore in 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:53.120
 columns we are going to have hundreds of thousand 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.830
 tens of thousand units of 1000 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 hundred 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.720
 of scene unity in the columns we are going to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.350
 locate the numbers we have in each 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.380
 one of the values 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.170
 in 2 we will have the 4 in the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.450
 antennas 2 in the tens and 9 in 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.490
 the units now in units of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.300
 1000 that was left in the middle we do not have 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:23.640
 nothing is to say we have 0 units of 1000 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.640
 therefore the number that is formed is 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:33.939
 20,429 the examples are countless but 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.939
 they always respect the same quality 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.820
 educational I recommend the following 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.820
 videos so you can keep learning
