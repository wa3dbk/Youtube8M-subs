round of wintry weather across the area

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.549 
round of wintry weather across the area
and<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> main<00:00:33.480> impacts<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.140> come<00:00:34.290> from<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and the main impacts will come from a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
and the main impacts will come from a
combination<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.219> freezing<00:00:35.610> rain<00:00:35.640> sleet<00:00:36.090> and

combination of freezing rain sleet and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.369 
combination of freezing rain sleet and
snow<00:00:38.570> there<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.629> concerns<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.170> the

snow there are concerns that the
accumulation<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.129> snow<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.579> sleet<00:00:41.910> will

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
accumulation of snow and sleet will

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
accumulation of snow and sleet will
result<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> slick<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> hazardous<00:00:43.230> driving

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
result in slick and hazardous driving

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
result in slick and hazardous driving
conditions<00:00:44.539> there's<00:00:45.539> also<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
conditions there's also going to be a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
conditions there's also going to be a
narrow<00:00:46.410> corridor<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.160> moderate<00:00:47.550> to

narrow corridor for moderate to
significant<00:00:48.360> icing<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.289> certainly

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
significant icing and this is certainly

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.840 
significant icing and this is certainly
going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> result<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.520> slick<00:00:50.760> and

going to result in some slick and
hazardous<00:00:50.910> travel<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.680> also

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
hazardous travel and this will also

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.889 
hazardous travel and this will also
result<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.699> issues<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> trees<00:00:54.690> and

North and Central Texas should be below

so here's a brief summary of what is

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
so here's a brief summary of what is
