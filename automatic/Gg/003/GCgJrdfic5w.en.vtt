from five or ten minutes which I've seen

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.920 
from five or ten minutes which I've seen
that's<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:30.940> smallest<00:06:31.940> amount<00:06:32.300> of<00:06:32.389> time<00:06:32.570> all

that's the smallest amount of time all

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.570 
that's the smallest amount of time all
the<00:06:33.110> way<00:06:33.200> up<00:06:33.380> to<00:06:34.330> 30<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.720> 40<00:06:36.080> 50<00:06:36.590> minutes<00:06:36.919> it<00:06:37.460> all

the way up to 30 to 40 50 minutes it all

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.020 
the way up to 30 to 40 50 minutes it all
depends<00:06:38.030> on<00:06:38.150> what<00:06:38.780> you're<00:06:38.930> loading<00:06:39.350> and<00:06:40.030> I'm

depends on what you're loading and I'm

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.090 
depends on what you're loading and I'm
just<00:06:41.330> bloating<00:06:41.810> bare<00:06:41.990> bones<00:06:42.230> so<00:06:42.590> it<00:06:42.800> shouldn't

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
just bloating bare bones so it shouldn't

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.500 
just bloating bare bones so it shouldn't
take<00:06:43.160> long<00:06:43.280> at<00:06:43.730> all<00:06:45.940> okay<00:06:46.940> so<00:06:47.000> that<00:06:47.240> took<00:06:47.360> about

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
take long at all okay so that took about

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.140 
take long at all okay so that took about
10<00:06:47.930> minutes<00:06:48.139> and<00:06:48.500> it<00:06:49.370> says<00:06:49.639> your<00:06:49.880> device

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
10 minutes and it says your device

restarting at this point it could take

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.250 
restarting at this point it could take
anywhere<00:07:01.010> from<00:07:01.370> let's<00:07:02.360> say<00:07:02.510> five<00:07:02.810> to<00:07:03.110> eight

minutes your device should be restarting

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.250 
minutes your device should be restarting
at<00:07:05.870> this<00:07:05.990> point<00:07:06.290> and<00:07:07.660> once<00:07:08.660> it's<00:07:08.840> completely

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
at this point and once it's completely

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.990 
at this point and once it's completely
up<00:07:09.530> you'll<00:07:09.830> go<00:07:09.979> through<00:07:10.250> the<00:07:10.400> little<00:07:10.880> wizard

after you do the restore you can make

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.010 
after you do the restore you can make
sure<00:07:39.410> that<00:07:39.590> you<00:07:39.680> have<00:07:39.919> the<00:07:40.539> hybrid<00:07:41.539> loaded<00:07:41.900> on

sure that you have the hybrid loaded on

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.050 
sure that you have the hybrid loaded on
and<00:07:42.229> you<00:07:42.320> have<00:07:42.440> the<00:07:42.560> correct<00:07:43.060> application

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.060 
and you have the correct application

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.070 
and you have the correct application
number<00:07:45.050> and<00:07:45.410> platform<00:07:46.340> number<00:07:46.600> it's<00:07:47.600> going<00:07:47.720> to

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 
number and platform number it's going to

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.870 
number and platform number it's going to
say<00:07:48.910> application<00:07:50.169> version<00:07:51.169> 4.7<00:07:51.979> point<00:07:52.639> zero

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:52.880 
say application version 4.7 point zero

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.760 
say application version 4.7 point zero
point<00:07:53.270> 1<00:07:53.570> 32<00:07:54.139> and<00:07:54.410> the<00:07:54.860> platform<00:07:55.400> is<00:07:55.639> the<00:07:55.880> 400

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
point 1 32 and the platform is the 400

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.580 
point 1 32 and the platform is the 400
162<00:07:57.770> so<00:07:58.010> that's<00:07:58.160> 130<00:07:58.669> to<00:07:58.880> 160<00:07:59.539> to<00:07:59.780> just<00:08:00.380> so<00:08:00.470> you

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:00.590 
162 so that's 130 to 160 to just so you

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.750 
162 so that's 130 to 160 to just so you
know<00:08:00.710> that<00:08:00.860> you<00:08:00.950> have<00:08:00.979> the<00:08:01.340> right<00:08:01.460> version
