00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
and easy three-step progression to work

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.130 
and easy three-step progression to work
up<00:00:21.619> to<00:00:21.650> doing<00:00:21.949> your<00:00:22.220> first<00:00:22.699> one-arm<00:00:23.539> push-up

so one-arm push-up its advanced push-up

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.639 
so one-arm push-up its advanced push-up
variation<00:00:28.359> this<00:00:29.359> is<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.509> great<00:00:29.720> exercise<00:00:29.929> if

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
variation this is a great exercise if

variation this is a great exercise if
you're<00:00:30.859> looking<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.189> actually<00:00:31.609> gain<00:00:32.180> strength

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
you're looking to actually gain strength

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.069 
you're looking to actually gain strength
and<00:00:33.050> muscle<00:00:33.500> with<00:00:34.220> using<00:00:35.000> just<00:00:35.269> your<00:00:35.510> own<00:00:35.780> body

and muscle with using just your own body
weight<00:00:36.350> as<00:00:36.530> resistance<00:00:37.539> so<00:00:38.539> you<00:00:39.350> may<00:00:39.530> be<00:00:39.590> able

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
weight as resistance so you may be able

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.040 
weight as resistance so you may be able
to<00:00:39.949> just<00:00:40.160> pop<00:00:40.910> them<00:00:41.090> in<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.269> floor<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:41.690> do<00:00:41.840> one

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
to just pop them in the floor and do one

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.919 
to just pop them in the floor and do one
on<00:00:42.170> push<00:00:42.440> up<00:00:42.649> at<00:00:42.739> odds<00:00:42.949> are<00:00:43.250> we<00:00:43.760> want<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.300> you're

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
on push up at odds are we want to you're

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.540 
on push up at odds are we want to you're
going<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.170> progress<00:00:45.440> up<00:00:45.769> to<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.100> you're<00:00:46.429> going

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
going to progress up to it you're going

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.279 
going to progress up to it you're going
to<00:00:46.609> have<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.879> learn<00:00:46.910> how<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.329> use<00:00:47.570> your<00:00:47.870> body<00:00:48.079> in

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
to have to learn how to use your body in

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.509 
to have to learn how to use your body in
the<00:00:48.410> right<00:00:48.559> way<00:00:48.769> and<00:00:49.010> gauge<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.370> right

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
the right way and gauge the right

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.790 
the right way and gauge the right
muscles<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:49.969> do<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:50.210> exercise<00:00:50.660> properly<00:00:51.469> and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
muscles to do the exercise properly and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400 
muscles to do the exercise properly and
most<00:00:52.129> efficiently<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.210> here's<00:00:53.390> my<00:00:53.480> simple

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
most efficiently so here's my simple

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.770 
most efficiently so here's my simple
three-step<00:00:55.190> process<00:00:55.429> first<00:00:56.239> one<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.570> going<00:00:56.719> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
three-step process first one is going to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.779 
three-step process first one is going to
be<00:00:56.870> called<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.199> shift<00:00:57.559> in<00:00:57.769> push-up<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:58.760> is

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
be called a shift in push-up so this is

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.520 
be called a shift in push-up so this is
going<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:58.969> help<00:00:59.149> you<00:00:59.359> get<00:00:59.960> into<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.350> right

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
going to help you get into the right

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.189 
going to help you get into the right
body<00:01:00.769> position<00:01:01.480> without<00:01:02.480> actually

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
body position without actually

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.079 
body position without actually
supporting<00:01:03.920> all<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.190> your<00:01:04.489> weight<00:01:04.640> only<00:01:04.820> up

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
supporting all of your weight only up

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.330 
supporting all of your weight only up
one<00:01:05.269> arm<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:06.020> if<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.620> get<00:01:06.770> into<00:01:06.950> regular

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
one arm so if you get into regular

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.850 
one arm so if you get into regular
push-up<00:01:07.940> position<00:01:08.260> you're<00:01:09.260> going<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.440> go<00:01:09.560> wide

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
push-up position you're going to go wide

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.430 
push-up position you're going to go wide
stance<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.120> can<00:01:11.270> get<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> little<00:01:12.260> bit

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
stance so you can get a little bit

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.070 
stance so you can get a little bit
better<00:01:12.620> balance<00:01:13.160> as<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.400> work<00:01:13.580> forward<00:01:14.480> we<00:01:14.960> do

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
better balance as we work forward we do

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.360 
better balance as we work forward we do
different<00:01:15.470> versions<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.040> one-armed

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
different versions the one-armed

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.980 
different versions the one-armed
push-ups<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.210> can<00:01:17.330> actually<00:01:17.480> even<00:01:17.750> doing

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
push-ups you can actually even doing

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.900 
push-ups you can actually even doing
your<00:01:18.620> one<00:01:19.040> arm<00:01:19.160> push<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.460> with<00:01:19.610> your<00:01:19.640> feet

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
your one arm push it with your feet

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.120 
your one arm push it with your feet
together<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.630> on<00:01:20.930> one<00:01:21.230> foot<00:01:21.530> that's<00:01:21.920> much

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
together and on one foot that's much

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.680 
together and on one foot that's much
more<00:01:22.310> difficult<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:22.790> our<00:01:22.940> standard<00:01:23.330> version

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
more difficult so our standard version

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.780 
more difficult so our standard version
is<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.140> going<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.320> be<00:01:24.410> with<00:01:24.500> our<00:01:24.620> feet<00:01:24.860> wide<00:01:25.070> so

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
is it going to be with our feet wide so

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.340 
is it going to be with our feet wide so
our<00:01:25.910> ship<00:01:26.150> can<00:01:26.360> push<00:01:26.570> up<00:01:26.780> we're<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.260> go

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
our ship can push up we're going to go

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.770 
our ship can push up we're going to go
wide<00:01:27.560> stance<00:01:28.180> you're<00:01:29.180> going<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.360> transfer

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
wide stance you're going to transfer

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.620 
wide stance you're going to transfer
your<00:01:29.900> weight<00:01:29.960> over<00:01:30.500> up<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.010> one<00:01:31.220> side<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:32.000> your

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
your weight over up to one side and your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.360 
your weight over up to one side and your
other<00:01:32.780> hand<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.260> going<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:33.590> balancing<00:01:34.130> here

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
other hand is going to be balancing here

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.520 
other hand is going to be balancing here
on<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.550> floor<00:01:34.730> now<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.390> can<00:01:35.510> see<00:01:35.810> all<00:01:36.080> my

then our actual armed pushup that's the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.090 
then our actual armed pushup that's the
next<00:03:20.840> step<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.380> can<00:03:21.500> work<00:03:21.650> yourself<00:03:21.980> up

next step so you can work yourself up
from<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> high<00:03:22.550> elevation<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> lower

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
from a high elevation to a lower

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.950 
from a high elevation to a lower
elevation<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.130> then<00:03:25.370> our<00:03:25.820> last<00:03:26.150> step<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.810> our

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
elevation and then our last step is our

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.180 
elevation and then our last step is our
actual<00:03:27.140> one<00:03:27.560> our<00:03:27.680> questions<00:03:29.800> so<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:30.890> can<00:03:31.010> see

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190
