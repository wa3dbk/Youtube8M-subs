00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.949
 fanpage I was very interested in 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.829
 To see how is this map, we are here. 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.200
 in Boat Park is the classic boat of the 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.630
 first god of war and let's see how 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.090
 There's this story to see if it 's okay. 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.340
 similar or if it's really cool for us 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.630

 A little glimpse, right? 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.100
 we are welcome here the credit if 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.190
 he is talking let's go let's go then 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.400
 We have to get down here soon . 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.080
 We started fighting with those not 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.850
 I remember right will be the skulls and 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.009
 Do you remember some things there? 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.710
 Little chicks that we started fighting 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.390
 hence the people that here in this basement 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.460
 boat here the story below the boat 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.740
 and we had to do this pair here 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.710
 cury really expensive is very similar 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.600
 how jumping here looks only we had 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.659
 that to walk by this same wood, right? 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.490
 and here appeared the first lizard right 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.340
 already it looked like the first lizard then 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.749
 He tries to climb here and tries to climb here. 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.850
 because I've seen there that 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.549
 we find an enemy 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 is found tighten reads an enemy 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.569
 Here I am going to face this enemy, I'm going 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.270
 catch this enemy so I'll jump in 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.560
 end the beast with it will end 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.289
 with her because mano does not accept these 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.840
 things do not fall into thirst into the water that more 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.840
 We return here by the stone. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.909
 Let's go up here, the lizard is not enough anymore. 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.179
 Well, excuse me, sorry. Formal apology. 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.399
 Sorry, sorry it was not part of 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.329
 beat but I'll get him to see the enemy 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.310
 What's the beauty? 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.319
 then we take the weapon is you guys 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.719
 Can you see and let's go, I'll continue 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.030
 so no monster just to look beauty 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.440
 then're very similar to so far now 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.490
 people come here and we'll see what we 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.220
 we here here that affection 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.290
 talk to us and he gets stuck there right 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.380
 He talks to us and you have to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.950
 kill him but the co 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.150
 It follows right here and we disagreed when compared whoop 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.290
 beauty is kind of like a just one 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.510
 fantasy is what you create in your mind 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.240
 destroy but can not obstruct 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 that's where the second monster appears, right or wrong. 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.740
 in fact he is the first one that appears 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.470
 runs away and appears here again I think 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.510
 Then you 'll hit him and you defeat him. 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.150
 Drop here after you defeat him, right? 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.340
 There you go, man. It's very similar. 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.400
 Congratulations, the guy who created this map. 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.310
 It's good looking, there it is. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.350
 complete map is taken I do not know yet 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.010
 If you have a face, you'll have more respect. 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.660
 because the first god of war was what 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.850
 my brain what I liked the most 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.320
 play if I'm not mistaken it was play 2 in 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.060
 Playstation 2 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.730
 Our lady, I miss you, face with 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.450
 Playstation 2 nostalgia is present today 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.550
 in 143 there is no longer that those 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.650
 old games is getting behind 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.240
 so here we have that part where the 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.670
 people have to push the box how much 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.160
 there are some enemies there with the arrow 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:30.530
 we go here pro and hence the enemies 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.500
 on top they have a chance to destroy the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.820
 box is and also to kill you but the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.320
 damage is very little 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.240
 Then you have to get up here after 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.190
 you put the box down 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.900
 there you kill the warriors that stay 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.540
 here on the platforms right? 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.000
 damn guy nostalgia then you come 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.990

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.209
 ladder 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.880
 here on the stairs beauty then let's follow 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.160
 The rules are there, now we have to 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.120
 up here is it looks just not here 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.030
 I believe 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.740
 We have to get up here where I do not 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.830
 I remember that here but I think it 's network 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.570
 I do not remember right now but 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.000
 We really come up here, right? 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.070
 in the game then we just go from my son 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.840

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.510
 truth is a lizard 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.200
 I never found out but it seems to be a 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.030
 your dinosaur is 3- headed 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.700

 Here we get it, right? 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.420
 here we pick it up it releases the passage 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.590
 for people to get through 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.990
 animal hunting 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.540
 How do you see we have to get up here, man? 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.450

 Look really, and here for us. 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.880
 to defeat we had to climb right 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.820
 if I'm not mistaken we had to climb 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.640
 here we beat our heads 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.620
 side is to do away with the race on the 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.720
 We'll get the main here later. 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.570
 which is the giant there is not the greatest there 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.790
 we end up with his race us there 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.730
 continued our journey here is not for 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.080
 What if this species is such a rope? 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.810
 if I'm not mistaken a rope that people 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.950
 spent here then we to the other 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.380
 boat right 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.700
 and then I do not remember what I had in the neighborhood 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.980
 if I'm not mistaken, folks after 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.100
 people killed the animal, we got a 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.750
 man inside the animal that he took 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.950
 key to save the women who 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.130
 They were on the boat, right? 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.310
 We come here with a goal that the 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.560
 You have to now wait a minute now tie 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.770

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.110
 We come here and do the same things, huh? 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.650
 Only the box will already be here. 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.970
 Come up here beauty now we have to 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.620

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.770
 I had to save women only 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.640
 When we get here at the door, no. 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.530
 opened the door 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.110
 women are dead and we are 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.580

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.160
 The camera is that we are against women 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.150
