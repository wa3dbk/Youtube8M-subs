00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
just make them it doesn't really slow
you<00:01:30.810> down<00:01:31.079> anyway<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.799> people<00:01:31.979> kind<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you down anyway some people kind of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.490 
you down anyway some people kind of
thought<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> lot<00:01:32.790> slower<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:34.140> hasn't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
thought it was a lot slower it hasn't

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960 
thought it was a lot slower it hasn't
changed<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.890> anyway<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.670> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
changed it anyway it's just kind of a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
changed it anyway it's just kind of a
like<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.420> guess<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:36.960> two<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.290> clicks<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
like I guess one or two more clicks and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.469 
like I guess one or two more clicks and
inventory<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
inventory as you can see right there it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.969 
inventory as you can see right there it
really<00:01:39.720> doesn't<00:01:40.020> spend<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.770> doesn't

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
really doesn't spend it really doesn't

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.260 
really doesn't spend it really doesn't
waste<00:01:41.070> too<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.549> time<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.000> kind<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
waste too much more time it's kind of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
waste too much more time it's kind of
odd<00:01:42.540> why<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:42.960> would<00:01:43.110> ever<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
odd why they would ever do this like it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700 
odd why they would ever do this like it
literally<00:01:44.310> makes<00:01:44.490> no<00:01:45.000> sense<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.710> this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
literally makes no sense at all this

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.020 
literally makes no sense at all this
update<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.340> mean<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.610> doesn't<00:01:47.909> do

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
update like I mean it doesn't do

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
update like I mean it doesn't do
anything<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.140> make<00:01:49.380> them

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
anything I just you like you make them

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
anything I just you like you make them
extra<00:01:49.890> than<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.210> no

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
extra than you do there's really no

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.050 
extra than you do there's really no
difference<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.170> ah<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> guess<00:01:53.549> when

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
difference at all ah but I guess when

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.120 
difference at all ah but I guess when
you're<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.810> wanna<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.770> update

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130

which is like really far north like they
look<00:03:13.470> at<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> picture<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.250> see<00:03:14.370> how<00:03:14.460> far<00:03:14.490> apart

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
look at the picture to see how far apart

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.480 
look at the picture to see how far apart
they<00:03:15.240> are<00:03:15.270> like<00:03:15.660> she's<00:03:16.560> running<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.460> way

from here to here when there's a bank
right<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.390> think<00:03:22.140> it's<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> lot<00:03:22.440> closer

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
right there I think it's a lot closer

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.890 
right there I think it's a lot closer

not to mention she's encouraged it's
just<00:03:25.080> kind<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.350> weird<00:03:25.410> i<00:03:25.590> don't<00:03:25.620> mean<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.920> put

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
just kind of weird i don't mean to put

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.740

her<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> spot<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.060> make<00:03:27.270> fun<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.540> her
