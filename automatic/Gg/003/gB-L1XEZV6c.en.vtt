00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 i 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.029
 Maria Herrera and Ana Carrasco always 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.170
 they smile although the grand prize of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.719
 germany at the sachsenring circuit 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.870
 they will not remember it with special joy 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.599
 Maria suffered a fall on the cp3 and after 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.700
 which received a penalty of three 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.430
 places on the starting grid and ten 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.590
 minutes less dewarman anna had also 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 problems in which your partner's 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 team or classes I threw it wins it ended 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.419
 very very angry but the worst for the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.829
 two came in the race 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.350
 Herrera who has played with Ana 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.760
 carrasco our two pilots are gone 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.760
 in state they have touched 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.860
 bad luck bad luck 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.460
 mariah was able to get off track by her own 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.570
 but Anna had to help her and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.000
 so I came to the diagnostic clinic 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 Maria dislocation of the left shoulder that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.190
 will be operated at the end of the season 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.860
 conan to advance and start 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.380
 comeback and to go sideways but good 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.149
 are those of career and that of being a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 early recovery because I already know that 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.289
 has a fracture and the truth that a 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.649
 penalty of the back okay just a 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.200
 Swipe and the bike but well above 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.530
 anna neck fracture number 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530
 shoulder 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.909
 morning 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.800
 to see the doctor mingo surely 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.229
 let's do an operation to recover 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.720
 as quickly as possible facing the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.720
 next race inside for me 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.480
 added because there was not much space 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.720
 again we have fallen and now can 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.720
 avoid 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.469
 with oil career and here they arrive 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 vacations and both can be recovered 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.630
 calmly be everything and as we said 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.219
 at the beginning marÃ­a herrera y ana 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.219
