00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
250r and I just had time today to guess

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.189 
250r and I just had time today to guess
make<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> video<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.210> how<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.269> installed<00:00:45.720> it<00:00:45.839> so

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
make a video of how I installed it so

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.280 
make a video of how I installed it so
the<00:00:46.920> package<00:00:47.280> came<00:00:47.790> like<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> inside

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
the package came like this and inside

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.970 
the package came like this and inside
there<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.519> instructions<00:00:51.559> this<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.739> really

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
there was instructions this is really

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
there was instructions this is really
important<00:00:53.400> it's<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.239> wiring<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.839> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
important it's like the wiring that you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.439 
important it's like the wiring that you
need<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.920> connect<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.699> own

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
need to do to connect it to your own

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.780 
need to do to connect it to your own
bike<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.430> we'll<00:00:59.909> have<00:01:00.089> this<00:01:01.790> sewing

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
bike and then we'll have this sewing

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.840 
bike and then we'll have this sewing
from<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.180> kawasaki<00:01:03.900> ninja<00:01:04.019> from<00:01:04.640> posted<00:01:05.640> where

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
from a kawasaki ninja from posted where

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
from a kawasaki ninja from posted where
all<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.630> wires<00:01:06.869> needed<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.710> be

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
all of these wires needed to be

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.940 
all of these wires needed to be
connected<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.500> turn<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.740> up

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
connected to so I just turn it that up

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
connected to so I just turn it that up
because<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.729> lot<00:01:12.119> easier<00:01:12.299> than<00:01:12.600> looking

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
because it's a lot easier than looking

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
because it's a lot easier than looking
at<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.830> wiring<00:01:14.250> diagram<00:01:14.450> what<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> should

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
at this wiring diagram what you should

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.130 
at this wiring diagram what you should
probably<00:01:16.020> also<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.549> buddy<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.720> inside<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
probably also have a buddy so inside it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.649 
probably also have a buddy so inside it
came<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.409> these<00:01:19.560> two<00:01:19.950> LCD<00:01:20.490> 2-way<00:01:21.270> remotes

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
came with these two LCD 2-way remotes

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.820 
came with these two LCD 2-way remotes
and<00:01:22.610> inside<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> speaker<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.680> all

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and inside there was the speaker and all

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.880 
and inside there was the speaker and all
those<00:01:25.979> wires<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.750> because<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.020> installed<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
those wires but because I installed it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.070 
those wires but because I installed it
already<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.630> guess<00:01:30.930> I'll

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
already it's not in here so I guess I'll

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.649 
already it's not in here so I guess I'll
show<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.680> worded<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:33.210> order<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
show you how I worded it in order to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.599 
show you how I worded it in order to
install<00:01:33.929> this<00:01:34.109> probably<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.340> these

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
install this probably want to take these

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.940 
install this probably want to take these
panels<00:01:36.240> off<00:01:36.359> there's<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.170> plastic<00:01:37.619> panel

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
panels off there's this plastic panel

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.700 
panels off there's this plastic panel
down<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.719> other<00:01:39.810> side<00:01:40.109> I'll

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
down here and on the other side I'll

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.399 
down here and on the other side I'll
stop<00:01:41.249> that<00:01:41.640> way<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.060> access<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.109> screws

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
stop that way you can access the screws

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
stop that way you can access the screws
to<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> seat<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.789> take<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to the seat and then you can take the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.149 
to the seat and then you can take the
seat<00:01:45.210> off<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.719> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.140> take<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
seat off and then you can also take the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.260 
seat off and then you can also take the
rear<00:01:47.369> seat<00:01:47.609> off<00:01:48.079> for<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.469> chose<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.280> drill<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
rear seat off for me I chose to drill a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.099 
rear seat off for me I chose to drill a
hole<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.009> had<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> route<00:01:54.109> the

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
hole right here and I had to route the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.710 
hole right here and I had to route the
LED<00:01:55.649> wire<00:01:55.859> all

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
LED wire all

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.150 
LED wire all
is<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.500> tighter<00:01:57.710> done<00:01:57.980> so<00:01:58.760> that's<00:01:59.480> that<00:02:00.160> so

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
is it tighter done so that's that so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.860 
is it tighter done so that's that so
here<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.520> installed<00:02:01.910> on<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.090> bike<00:02:02.300> if<00:02:02.750> you

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
here it is installed on my bike if you

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.560 
here it is installed on my bike if you
want<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.080> do<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.230> properly<00:02:03.530> you're<00:02:03.920> probably

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
want to do this properly you're probably

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.460 
want to do this properly you're probably
soldering<00:02:05.570> iron<00:02:05.840> solder<00:02:06.230> maybe<00:02:07.220> some

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
soldering iron solder maybe some

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.200 
soldering iron solder maybe some
electrical<00:02:09.470> tape<00:02:09.500> or<00:02:09.830> heat<00:02:10.340> shrink<00:02:10.610> tubes<00:02:10.850> but

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
electrical tape or heat shrink tubes but

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.040 
electrical tape or heat shrink tubes but
opted<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.200> go<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.090> t-top<00:02:14.090> method<00:02:14.450> because<00:02:14.810> I'm

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
opted to go the t-top method because I'm

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.500 
opted to go the t-top method because I'm
this<00:02:15.920> off<00:02:16.100> later<00:02:16.310> upgrade<00:02:17.120> my<00:02:17.240> bike

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.640 

I'll<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:23.690> show<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.050> connections<00:02:24.470> that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
I'll just show you the connections that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.350 
I'll just show you the connections that
I<00:02:24.710> made<00:02:25.780> there's<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.140> siren<00:02:27.350> here<00:02:28.090> under<00:02:29.090> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
I made there's the siren here under the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.570 
I made there's the siren here under the
tank<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.840> then<00:02:30.530> there's<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.130> LED<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.520> runs

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
tank and then there's the LED that runs

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.250 
tank and then there's the LED that runs
here<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:37.090> back<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.720> trunk

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
here and back in the trunk

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.280 
here and back in the trunk
there's<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:40.400> shock<00:02:40.640> sensor<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.990> there's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
there's the shock sensor and there's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.570 
there's the shock sensor and there's
also<00:02:42.490> antenna<00:02:43.490> so<00:02:44.300> for<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.080> other<00:02:45.170> wiring<00:02:45.580> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
also antenna so for the other wiring the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.090 
also antenna so for the other wiring the
yellow<00:02:46.970> ones<00:02:47.209> are<00:02:47.390> for<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.230> signals<00:02:48.650> turn

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
yellow ones are for the signals turn

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.210 
yellow ones are for the signals turn
signals<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:50.720> flash<00:02:50.990> when<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.410> activate<00:02:52.070> the

clicking<00:03:16.670> June<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.920> there's<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.190> this

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
clicking June so there's that this

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.080 
clicking June so there's that this
blacks<00:03:20.450> there's<00:03:21.110> one<00:03:21.950> black<00:03:22.190> one<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.910> goes

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
blacks there's one black one that goes

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.610 
blacks there's one black one that goes
to<00:03:23.269> ground

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
to ground

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.690 
to ground
there's<00:03:24.620> another<00:03:24.890> black<00:03:25.190> wire<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.430> goes

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
there's another black wire that goes

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.530 
there's another black wire that goes
into<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.860> negative<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.070> battery<00:03:28.540> but

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
into the negative of the battery but

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.300 
into the negative of the battery but
that<00:03:29.720> goes<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.080> pod<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.410> positive<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.190> the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
that goes to the pod is positive of the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.229 
that goes to the pod is positive of the
battery<00:03:31.630> there's<00:03:32.630> also<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:33.080> these<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:34.239> think

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
battery there's also of these I think

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.300 
battery there's also of these I think
the<00:03:35.780> grey<00:03:35.959> one<00:03:36.170> goes<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.709> something<00:03:37.070> called

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
the grey one goes to something called

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.550 
the grey one goes to something called
CDF<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:39.370> these<00:03:40.600> pink<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.840> brown<00:03:41.989> ones<00:03:42.290> that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
CDF and these pink and brown ones that

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.300 
CDF and these pink and brown ones that
go<00:03:43.040> into<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.880> ignition<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.410> plugged<00:03:46.190> them

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
go into the ignition but I plugged them

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.229 
go into the ignition but I plugged them
in<00:03:46.459> here

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239

I<00:03:47.269> found<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:49.190> tutorial<00:03:49.400> online

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
I found the tutorial online

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.190 
I found the tutorial online
from<00:03:51.070> another<00:03:51.370> ninja<00:03:52.120> forum<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.930> just

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
from another ninja forum and I just

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.080 
from another ninja forum and I just
thought<00:03:53.320> what<00:03:53.680> people<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.610> it's<00:03:54.790> pretty<00:03:54.940> much

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
thought what people so it's pretty much

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.530 
thought what people so it's pretty much
this<00:03:55.510> one<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.710> then<00:03:57.040> this<00:03:57.610> fat<00:03:58.710> brown<00:03:59.710> wire<00:03:59.920> so

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
this one and then this fat brown wire so

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.650 
this one and then this fat brown wire so
that's<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.410> moat<00:04:02.680> start<00:04:03.660> there's

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
that's that for the moat start there's

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.180 
that's that for the moat start there's
this<00:04:04.840> blue<00:04:05.110> wire<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:06.250> connects<00:04:06.640> into<00:04:07.300> here

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
this blue wire that connects into here

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.970 
this blue wire that connects into here
hopefully<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.280> can<00:04:09.400> see<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.670> but<00:04:10.950> when<00:04:11.950> I

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
hopefully you can see it but when I

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.060 
hopefully you can see it but when I
tried<00:04:12.250> doing<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.610> remote<00:04:12.820> start<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:14.070> bike

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
tried doing the remote start the bike

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.140 
tried doing the remote start the bike
would<00:04:15.250> crank<00:04:15.460> but<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:15.760> wouldn't<00:04:15.970> start

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
would crank but it wouldn't start

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.259 
would crank but it wouldn't start
there's<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:17.130> supposedly<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.400> security<00:04:19.090> feature

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
there's a supposedly a security feature

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.650 
there's a supposedly a security feature
that<00:04:20.459> disables<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.580> but<00:04:21.850> there's<00:04:22.210> ways<00:04:22.420> of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
that disables it but there's ways of

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.770 
that disables it but there's ways of
bypassing<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.410> which<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.960> probably<00:04:26.320> fine<00:04:26.530> I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
bypassing it which and probably fine I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.930 
bypassing it which and probably fine I
forgot<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.930> mention<00:04:29.050> instead<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.860> cutting<00:04:30.580> one

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
forgot to mention instead of cutting one

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.880 
forgot to mention instead of cutting one
of<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.180> wires<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.810> can<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.170> pull<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.650> fuse

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
of the wires you can just pull the fuse

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.380 
of the wires you can just pull the fuse
out<00:04:33.070> right<00:04:33.220> here<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.880> kind<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.090> breaks<00:04:37.410> I
