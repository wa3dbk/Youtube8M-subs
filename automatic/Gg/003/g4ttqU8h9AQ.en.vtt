00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.830

 You are invited to an evening event 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.590
 but you have no more time again 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 to go home to change your clothes 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 Of course it would be great if you were on 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.700
 day already that has what then for 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.559
 The evening fits my question now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 to you, you're a boutique owner 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.610
 and hate years of experience in the field 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 How do I do that? 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.820
 that i look out of my daytime the evening 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 magic 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
 Actually, that's just us 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 have been really lucky this time 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.750
 james 24 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.539
 supports us and has us very much 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.699
 asked convertible mode for disposal 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.520
 and well-known designers here will be luxury 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.020
 with casual chic compatible 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.030
 Today we also have a model with us 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.110
 what is our model wearing today ? 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.549
 nano is a tenant 68 tall and wearing 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 Dress size 36 we catch it 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.689
 best with her the spread blazer on 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.760
 The squared is a very high quality 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.189
 extremely fashionable Italian label 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.229
 stands for extremely good rating is very 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 physical and very high quality man 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.520
 soon wears the squared size 42 that is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 comparable to a German 36 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.080
 yes it is not a small investment 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.200
 question that is not very cheap but 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 it is a money definitely worth okay 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.430
 that means the reader is very important 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 of course for the day for the office 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.460
 And what's up for a rocker? 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 wears a skirt from the French 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.380
 label markets winter six and thirteen 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.259
 it is very nice to share 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.140
 And so he guarantees his elasticity 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.090
 also some comfort then 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.100
 he does not stick so on the legs but 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.540
 He flows very nicely, that is committed 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 it was a bit too much 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.619
 nice slot but again 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 is underlined that one part of the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.760
 Just to see one's legs is something during the day 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.010
 certainly makes perfect sense and for 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.130
 in the evening is sufficient that you 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.679
 elegant and modern there is the model 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.660
 yes black white, you know what was 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.300
 because the thought behind it yes 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.610
 actually i have that a bit 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 done by itself because easy 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.330
 black and white is very well combinable 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.280
 and also black and white 2014 further extreme 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.410
 modern what is that for now 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 chic trousers that have it yes that is 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.360
 a really great leather pants very thin 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.470
 So thin leather and of the brand 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 put by ever extremely extroverted teams 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.440
 zips and just by the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.980
 white, that's very nice 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 unusual wise lee about what is 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.340
 that for a nice blower the plugin 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.830
 is from the french label I wear 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.620
 here's a big 36 so i have to say so 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.940
 falls extremely well underneath I have 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.600
 my personal favorite part of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.850
 white sox ann beds keystone hartmann 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.140
 is sensational and I think you can 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.110
 quite possibly even in the evening 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.310
 but to be addressed 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.079
 then you should stand too 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.630
 yes it 's just a bit 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.459
 Ultimately, I think the pants already 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.079
 sexy enough and the blazer very nice 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.489
 lined with the shoulders and the t 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.739
 Shirt is just a bit to start with 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.450
 casual and of course you have me too 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.880
 he dresses ten times a bit 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.230
 what to me yes I know so well 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.910
 in seoul and i know that like that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.110
 a bit annoying and I think 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.370
 you're not alone in that 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.549
 There are many women in the world who say 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.930
 I do not have to be on s like every day 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.459
 That's why we're starting to dress 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 maybe with the great jeans on 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.510
 contour suffered is an American 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.310
 label as I think he does a lot 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.700
 really great figure and really whole 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.579
 Great 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.470
 I think the blouse is comfortable too 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.060
 It appears from the American labels 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.370
 which he very much value on good 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.930
 materials and good material mix in front 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.670
 all things on the 6th 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.230
 Of course that is especially the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.700
 readers we thought it was great now 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.500
 the new collection of aero is about to start 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.510
 just came out and I still have 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.069
 last minute at jades 24 order 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.799
 I just think he has amazingly good 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.090
 you will also like these net inserts 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.620
 Surely you can also bring it with you this summer 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.239
 what a short wearing under then shimmers 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.700
 I found the skin here, too 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.989
 really great and make white and natural shades 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.120
 just good times 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.090
 so always to say the sizes 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.650
 Wears size 29 with the jeans and me 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.959
 think that art knows very well 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.740
 dazzle she wears big small and the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.150
 jacket of tube is also 36 o'clock and then 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.770
 Of course, you have everything for me 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.180
 special school selected and indeed 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.440
 we took the new valentinus 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.430
 So that's really a must-have 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.780
 this season 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.669
 I also found the combination of the 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.970
 color really great, it is very tender that is 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.910
 a very pale swb with gray 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.470
 combined and yes I think just on 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.729
 this school will go all the outfits 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.160
 a little that certain something 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.800
 So I feel great as it is 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.289
 It looks like modeling for the evening 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.580
 So it lures with the evening so yes 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.530
 if you think of us we change 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.870
 actually we have only the shoes 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.479
 selected by the new yorker label 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.699
 Prenzler school just demi moore syria 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.889
 only of that it just becomes extremely often 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.400
 worn very sophisticated very modern 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.419
 and yes and that's the shoe actually 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.460
 that too is really a strappy sandal 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.470
 So how it is worn again now 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.900
 and with a very nice metal 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.669
 detail and yes also has a height of 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.080
 think about six centimeters so 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.080
 I still have a career 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.770
 We also have the shoes for the evening 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.389
 lets him blow me to that I can 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.150
 Of course , let go and great share 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.500
 Of course always a matter of worth of disk 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.699
 but we thought him out 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.370
 simply because we also have the great 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.310
 see pink lining from the readers 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.259
 and second, it is so the top 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.289
 helmut lang an incredibly happy at 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.210
 cutout has the poor ones are with once 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.550
 with leather parceled on both sides 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.169
 and for all those who are beautiful 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.520
 So please show up in the pot 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.169
 In any case , you do something 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.460
 daintier one must also say so the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.860
 the excerpt is very much 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.720
 Clever chosen otherwise it is just ahead 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.410
 to lift that 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.389
 material combinations super comfortable too 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.949
 one is only able to wear it, she already said 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.389
 that's great, that's the belly too 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.860
 a bit casual here is that here 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.389
 a bit ruffled so you can see it too 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.770
 not necessarily everything also hides 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.419
 just a little bit, anyway 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.190
 body-contoured silhouette 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.930
 So I think we are all great 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.120
 We dressed three now it can start 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.220

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.889
 many thanks for 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.479
 your great ideas and that was it from 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.160
 Many thanks for watching us 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.889
