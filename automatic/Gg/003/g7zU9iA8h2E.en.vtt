00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.339 
a good intro on in the track around the
222<00:02:12.220> marca<00:02:12.819> definitely<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.629> reminded<00:02:14.140> me<00:02:14.200> of

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
222 marca definitely it reminded me of

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.710 
222 marca definitely it reminded me of
another<00:02:14.770> track<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:16.120> should<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.480> been<00:02:16.510> an

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
another track that should have been an

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.740 
another track that should have been an
outtake<00:02:16.870> from<00:02:17.590> their<00:02:18.370> last<00:02:18.610> album<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.510> alerts

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
outtake from their last album the alerts

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.750 
outtake from their last album the alerts
were<00:02:20.019> kind<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.379> reminiscent<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.220> older

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
were kind of reminiscent of the older

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390 
were kind of reminiscent of the older
track<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.780> they<00:02:22.930> came<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.319> with<00:02:23.500> previously

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
track that they came out with previously

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.150 
track that they came out with previously
right<00:02:24.730> number<00:02:25.000> eight<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.390> entitled

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
right number eight is entitled

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.400 
right number eight is entitled
punishment<00:02:26.640> time<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.120> 22nd<00:02:27.810> mark<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.170> thought

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
punishment time the 22nd mark I thought

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.680 
punishment time the 22nd mark I thought
it<00:02:28.560> had<00:02:28.740> great<00:02:29.010> bass<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.790> also<00:02:30.090> drums<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it had great bass and also drums of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.350 
it had great bass and also drums of
those<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.560> heavy<00:02:31.860> during<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.790> part<00:02:33.090> it

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
those very heavy during that part it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.780 
those very heavy during that part it
feel<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.170> chorus<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.400> forced

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
feel like the chorus is kind of forced

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.620 
feel like the chorus is kind of forced
when<00:02:36.030> listening<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.650> seemed<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
when listening to it it seemed like a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
when listening to it it seemed like a
