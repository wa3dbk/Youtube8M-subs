another way I have the necklace strong

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.780 
another way I have the necklace strong
and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.080> have<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> crimp<00:00:37.559> bead<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.339> then<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and I have a crimp bead on and then a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.000 
and I have a crimp bead on and then a
bead<00:00:39.089> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:39.449> a<00:00:39.479> crimp<00:00:39.780> bead<00:00:39.839> I<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.680> simply

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
bead and then a crimp bead I can simply

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.939 
bead and then a crimp bead I can simply
run<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.339> wire<00:00:41.839> back<00:00:42.839> through<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.409> crimp

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
run the wire back through the crimp

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.490 
run the wire back through the crimp
beads<00:00:44.400> in<00:00:44.729> the<00:00:45.180> opposite<00:00:45.570> direction<00:00:48.350> pull<00:00:49.350> my

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
beads in the opposite direction pull my

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.590 
beads in the opposite direction pull my
wires<00:00:49.739> tight<00:00:50.129> after<00:00:50.339> them<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:53.150> crimp<00:00:54.150> down<00:00:54.210> on

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
wires tight after them and crimp down on

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
wires tight after them and crimp down on
those<00:00:54.839> wires<00:00:55.220> because<00:00:56.220> this<00:00:56.370> creates<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.790> lot

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
those wires because this creates a lot

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
those wires because this creates a lot
of<00:00:56.940> tension<00:00:57.089> and<00:00:57.600> pool<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.589> my<00:00:58.710> favorite

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
of tension and pool it's not my favorite

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
of tension and pool it's not my favorite
way<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.220> end<00:00:59.729> them<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.330> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:01.019> this<00:01:01.140> read

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
way to end them but you can do this read

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
way to end them but you can do this read
a<00:01:01.379> nice<00:01:01.619> clean<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.339> other<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> end<00:01:02.970> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
other wire on the loop that I made I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.789 
other wire on the loop that I made I
pull<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:35.850> short<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> does<00:01:37.530> is

pull these short and what that does is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
pull these short and what that does is
creates<00:01:38.189> two<00:01:38.520> loops<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.420> are<00:01:39.570> attached<00:01:39.929> to
