 container to contain our subscription 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.000
 organic 3 sawdust this will serve to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 accelerate the decomposition of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.149
 organic waste and will bring more 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.340
 nutrients to our organic fertilizer 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.470
 making organic fertilizer to start

 well placed inside the container 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.630
 we put a layer of sawdust on top of 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.090
 that layer of sawdust we put the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.190
 organic waste and finally 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.080
