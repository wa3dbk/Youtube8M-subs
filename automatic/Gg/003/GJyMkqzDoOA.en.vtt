what the crank is worn and you want to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.950 
what the crank is worn and you want to
check<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> way<00:00:57.000> around<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> crank<00:00:57.719> when

you know the explosion it's pushing the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.830 
you know the explosion it's pushing the
crank<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:09.270> only<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> show

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
crank down and it's only going to show

grit 600 800 grit sandpaper on a nice
flat<00:02:16.010> surface<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.640> use<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> surface<00:02:17.060> play<00:02:17.420> and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
flat surface I use a surface play and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.940 
flat surface I use a surface play and
working<00:02:20.090> back<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.450> forth<00:02:20.540> try<00:02:21.470> not<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.739> get<00:02:21.830> it

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
working back and forth try not to get it

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.449

to<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.099> tip<00:02:22.690> work<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.080> forth<00:02:24.250> seems<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.370> be

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
to a tip work back and forth seems to be

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.330 
to a tip work back and forth seems to be
the<00:02:25.549> best<00:02:25.670> way<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.180> found<00:02:26.799> also<00:02:27.799> make<00:02:28.070> sure

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the best way that I found also make sure

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.140 
the best way that I found also make sure
you<00:02:28.519> do<00:02:28.670> not<00:02:28.700> round<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.329> corner<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
you do not round the corner of the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.800 
you do not round the corner of the
piston<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.350> usually<00:02:34.269> usually<00:02:35.269> leave<00:02:35.570> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
piston and I usually usually leave the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.170 
piston and I usually usually leave the
darkness<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:36.950> piston<00:02:37.400> Eve<00:02:37.609> everything<00:02:37.970> if

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
darkness on the piston Eve everything if

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.340 
darkness on the piston Eve everything if
there's<00:02:38.359> some<00:02:38.510> scratches<00:02:38.660> are<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.320> a

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
there's some scratches are like a

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.960 
there's some scratches are like a
bearing<00:02:39.709> one<00:02:39.799> owners<00:02:40.100> saying<00:02:40.549> got<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.880> or

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
bearing one owners saying got in or

bearing one owners saying got in or
whatever<00:02:41.239> else<00:02:41.420> sometimes<00:02:42.109> saying<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.310> also

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
whatever else sometimes saying that also

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.740 
whatever else sometimes saying that also
but<00:02:43.850> not<00:02:44.000> very<00:02:44.120> often

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
but not very often

but not very often
another<00:02:45.560> thing<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.799> do<00:02:45.859> is<00:02:47.290> flatten<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.500> sealing

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
another thing I do is flatten a sealing

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.009 
another thing I do is flatten a sealing
surface<00:02:50.230> again<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:51.440> too<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.650> use<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> stone

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
surface again there too I use a stone

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.170 
surface again there too I use a stone
like<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.079> machinist<00:02:54.500> stone<00:02:54.819> working<00:02:55.819> back<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
like a machinist stone working back and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.420 
like a machinist stone working back and
forth<00:02:56.269> you'd<00:02:56.630> be<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.810> even<00:02:57.590> brand-new<00:02:57.980> engines

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
forth you'd be a even brand-new engines

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.770 
forth you'd be a even brand-new engines
I<00:02:58.670> do<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.630> it's<00:03:00.130> unbelievable<00:03:01.130> how<00:03:01.780> not

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
I do this on it's unbelievable how not

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.830 
I do this on it's unbelievable how not
flat<00:03:03.079> those<00:03:03.319> are<00:03:03.590> sometimes<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.970> another

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
flat those are sometimes the another

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.920 
flat those are sometimes the another
thing<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.109> do<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.609> rebuild<00:03:07.609> an<00:03:07.730> engine<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.120> clean

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
thing I do I rebuild an engine is clean

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.479 
thing I do I rebuild an engine is clean
up<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.139> head<00:03:09.290> button<00:03:09.590> get<00:03:09.980> all<00:03:10.069> that<00:03:10.220> carbon

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
up the head button get all that carbon

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.440 
up the head button get all that carbon
off<00:03:10.700> there<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:12.739> really<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.310> kind<00:03:13.519> of<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.880> little

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
off there it really is kind of a little

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.349 
off there it really is kind of a little
hard<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.810> do<00:03:14.989> at<00:03:15.440> home<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:16.040> use<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.639> lathe<00:03:16.850> spin<00:03:17.239> it

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
hard to do at home I use a lathe spin it

it's<00:03:53.210> it<00:03:54.210> just<00:03:55.130> up<00:03:56.130> some<00:03:56.340> bearing<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.610> last<00:03:56.790> so

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
it's it just up some bearing the last so

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.690 
it's it just up some bearing the last so
much<00:03:57.120> longer<00:03:57.830> one<00:03:58.830> thing<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.160> do<00:03:59.220> when<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.610> get

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
much longer one thing I do when you get

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.650 
much longer one thing I do when you get
the<00:03:59.940> block<00:04:00.750> cleaned<00:04:01.050> up<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:02.150> with<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.300> oils

the block cleaned up is with the oils

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.770 
the block cleaned up is with the oils
what<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.900> found<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.380> with<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.220> oils<00:04:05.690> from<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
what I found is with the oils from the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.750 
what I found is with the oils from the
Nitro<00:04:07.350> fuels<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.860> castor<00:04:08.190> oil<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.490> little

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
Nitro fuels of castor oil is a little

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.920 
Nitro fuels of castor oil is a little
thicker<00:04:08.940> oils<00:04:09.240> in<00:04:09.330> there<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.570> bearing<00:04:09.810> will

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
thicker oils in there the bearing will

the<00:06:29.789> motor<00:06:29.969> apart<00:06:30.089> and<00:06:31.189> pop<00:06:32.189> that<00:06:33.080> head<00:06:34.080> button

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
the motor apart and pop that head button

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.519 
the motor apart and pop that head button
on<00:06:35.149> and<00:06:36.149> then<00:06:38.389> as<00:06:39.389> far<00:06:39.539> as<00:06:39.599> the<00:06:39.750> backplate<00:06:40.169> same

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
on and then as far as the backplate same

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.350 
on and then as far as the backplate same
ways<00:06:40.830> when<00:06:41.099> we<00:06:41.189> took<00:06:41.339> it<00:06:41.430> apart<00:06:41.520> you<00:06:41.969> can<00:06:42.149> break

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
ways when we took it apart you can break

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.980 
ways when we took it apart you can break
the<00:06:42.569> piston<00:06:42.960> skirt<00:06:43.080> when<00:06:43.409> putting<00:06:43.649> a<00:06:44.990> back

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
the piston skirt when putting a back

the piston skirt when putting a back
plate<00:06:46.229> on<00:06:46.409> make<00:06:47.219> sure<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.490> piston<00:06:47.849> is<00:06:47.969> up<00:06:48.120> or

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
plate on make sure the piston is up or

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.089 
plate on make sure the piston is up or
at<00:06:48.839> least<00:06:48.870> most<00:06:49.199> of<00:06:49.349> the<00:06:49.409> way<00:06:49.500> up<00:06:49.560> and

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
came apart sometimes the piston will

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.570 
came apart sometimes the piston will
work<00:07:04.349> its<00:07:04.499> way<00:07:04.559> back<00:07:04.800> down<00:07:05.009> so<00:07:05.189> just<00:07:05.369> make<00:07:05.550> sure

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
work its way back down so just make sure

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.489 
work its way back down so just make sure
before<00:07:05.909> you<00:07:06.149> put<00:07:06.360> in<00:07:06.479> and<00:07:07.249> Google<00:07:08.249> pop<00:07:08.819> here

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:09.499 
before you put in and Google pop here

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:12.409 
before you put in and Google pop here
you<00:07:10.499> kind<00:07:11.249> of<00:07:11.339> you<00:07:11.430> feel<00:07:11.580> a<00:07:11.610> pop<00:07:11.879> like<00:07:11.909> that<00:07:12.119> and

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
you kind of you feel a pop like that and

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:13.519 
you kind of you feel a pop like that and
feel<00:07:12.569> some<00:07:12.749> resistance<00:07:12.869> you<00:07:13.289> know<00:07:13.379> the

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:13.529 
feel some resistance you know the

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:15.409 
feel some resistance you know the
o-rings<00:07:13.860> pretty<00:07:14.129> good<00:07:14.369> and<00:07:14.969> that<00:07:15.149> wouldn't

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
o-rings pretty good and that wouldn't

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.829 
o-rings pretty good and that wouldn't
need<00:07:15.569> to<00:07:15.689> be<00:07:15.809> sealed<00:07:16.279> some<00:07:17.279> motors<00:07:17.669> OS<00:07:18.389> is<00:07:18.599> kind

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:18.839 
need to be sealed some motors OS is kind

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.320 
need to be sealed some motors OS is kind
of<00:07:18.930> don't<00:07:19.169> have<00:07:19.349> quite<00:07:19.559> as<00:07:19.619> much<00:07:20.089> pop<00:07:21.089> there

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
of don't have quite as much pop there

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.489 
of don't have quite as much pop there
and<00:07:21.509> probably<00:07:21.839> should<00:07:21.990> make<00:07:22.139> sure<00:07:22.199> you

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:22.499 
and probably should make sure you

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:26.869 
and probably should make sure you
replace<00:07:22.889> that<00:07:22.919> o-ring<00:07:24.559> so<00:07:25.559> I<00:07:25.860> guess<00:07:26.159> some<00:07:26.399> rest

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 
replace that o-ring so I guess some rest

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.649 
replace that o-ring so I guess some rest
of<00:07:26.969> it<00:07:27.089> is<00:07:27.180> its<00:07:27.930> head<00:07:28.110> on<00:07:28.139> the<00:07:28.949> right<00:07:29.099> way<00:07:29.249> and

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:29.659 
of it is its head on the right way and

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:34.309 
of it is its head on the right way and
then<00:07:30.659> another<00:07:31.139> thing<00:07:31.379> I<00:07:31.499> do<00:07:31.559> too<00:07:31.889> is<00:07:33.319> head

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 
then another thing I do too is head

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.629 
then another thing I do too is head
bolts<00:07:34.710> I<00:07:35.149> always<00:07:36.149> put<00:07:36.809> some<00:07:37.110> oil<00:07:37.289> on<00:07:37.639> the

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 
bolts I always put some oil on the

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.360 
bolts I always put some oil on the
threads<00:07:38.939> after<00:07:39.509> your<00:07:39.629> bolts<00:07:40.050> clean<00:07:40.339> before<00:07:41.339> I

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
threads after your bolts clean before I

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.459 
threads after your bolts clean before I
drop<00:07:41.639> them<00:07:41.759> in<00:07:41.909> there<00:07:42.059> that<00:07:42.240> just<00:07:42.990> prevents<00:07:43.379> it

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:43.469 
drop them in there that just prevents it

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:46.549 
drop them in there that just prevents it
from<00:07:43.649> stripping<00:07:44.249> that<00:07:44.430> block<00:07:45.259> you<00:07:46.259> live<00:07:46.409> in<00:07:46.499> a

from stripping that block you live in a

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:50.029 
from stripping that block you live in a
block<00:07:46.800> when<00:07:47.490> you<00:07:47.580> tighten<00:07:47.789> it<00:07:47.939> down<00:07:49.039> that's

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 
block when you tighten it down that's

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.100 
block when you tighten it down that's
about<00:07:50.249> it<00:07:50.490> and<00:07:50.789> engine<00:07:51.479> assembly<00:07:51.719> will

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110 
about it and engine assembly will

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.899 
about it and engine assembly will
tighten<00:07:52.619> all<00:07:52.740> it<00:07:52.889> you<00:07:53.819> want<00:07:53.969> to<00:07:54.059> tighten

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:55.909 
tighten all it you want to tighten
