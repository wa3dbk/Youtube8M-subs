 iom x sa 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.510
 This product to introduce is at all Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.150
 It is a figure of Seikei Wagen Brook 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.150
 The side looks like this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.770
 Inside is feeling like this 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.960
 How weird it sounds 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.960
 In I think I want to open immediately 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.280
 I was upset 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.750
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.750
 One day this is happening 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.600
 Now change 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.600
 Hmm 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 Ha 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.690
 Bach 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 And he has become a double structure was saying, 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.890
 In I would like to immediately sheets of one shot eyes 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.890
 This double structure 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.829
 Then I tried to take out 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.509
 There was nothing other than this in the box 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.509
 I would like to separate 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.840
 I 'm cool 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.260
 jan 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.950
 perl 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.320
 It was hot inside when I thought that I did not leave 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.320
 So let's change it 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:43.750
 This is the part child that had entered during the next I think let's assembly immediately 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.740
 For the time being there was a pair 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.340
 If you change the angle 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.860
 I feel like this 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.640
 Now my friend took a photo 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.590
 It took 20 minutes to make it because it was so clumsy 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 It is for the time being Oite seen directly below the block are two bodies in the collection 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 You may not see it hidden 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.790
 here 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.250
 N it's useless 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.840
 The pin ball flew, but this time is up to here 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.430
 9 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.610
