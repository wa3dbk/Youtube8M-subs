00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.440
 What we have here is a tripod 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.620
 adapter and the universal holder for 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.530
 tablets or smartphones that here 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.090
 just then be fought and on 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.289
 the bottom is the clou and 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.029
 that is why it is interesting to 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.130
 example for the people and users of the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.289
 Knows rangers that you just that 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.849
 tablet on a tripod just this 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.019
 can clip holder of course 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.880
 now everything a little says nothing 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.259
 and that's why we're going to do it now 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.780
 tablet rhine very simple thing moratti 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.489
 this tripod holder but then this 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.079
 tablet and there you can see the tripod 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.699
 or the city has here 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.850
 just spread this way 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:49.449
 Of course that makes sense, we do 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.070
 then just put the ipad in here 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.600
 and you can see it directly 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.850
 whole is meant here and the whole thing too 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.039
 Fastening is the goals you know 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.320
 the whole units and down here 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.000
 that's just the side of the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.109
 then mounted on a tripod 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.460
 and then you can do the whole thing as well 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.750
 Imagine how you look at it completely 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.580
 wonderfully thought the whole 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.229
 just to use a table to stop 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.930
 just here, for example, just from the 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.880
 tablet what to read or even to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.729
 For example, a major has to be taken 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.080
 in our shop enter our number 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.770
 optics pull what that is really great 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.030
 ding the whole of the whole construction is 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.380
 then just here on a tripod thread 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.299
 I'll fix that now, too 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.590
 Just make short and have for it 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.880
 interested in this ballhead 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.880
 it is important that the plate down 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.530
 we turn here now 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.659
 then this plate just below underneath 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.490
 Of course, it makes sense to better one 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.740
 only now would the tripod age here 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.659
 consolidate on the containers so massa falls 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.520
 you are stuck here on such a fingernail 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.409
 also intended only for demo purposes and 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.780
 then you make the tablet practically then 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.250
 first in this tripod has 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.460
 Years you can the whole riege of here 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.600
 attach to the ball head 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.369
 that is of course representative of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.549
 a tripod or any other google 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.960
 topped it in a zoo and the whole 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.700
 Of course now expected presented 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.530
 I can do that on a tripod now 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.880
 and I build it is not enough 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.140
 but as I said you can 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.330
 probably directly pulling what meant 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.000
 Here you can also see it directly 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.520
 protocol is wonderful in the shop that is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.230
 Here is the tripod adapter with the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.030
 Persons of the matter for tablet or 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.030
 smartphone here in our shop
