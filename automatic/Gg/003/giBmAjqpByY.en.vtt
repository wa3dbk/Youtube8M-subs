because<00:02:35.099> this<00:02:35.849> game<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.780> frustrating

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
because this game is really frustrating

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.319 
because this game is really frustrating
with<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:38.129> times<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.069> map<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.609> definitely

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
with at times but this map is definitely

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.819 
with at times but this map is definitely
my<00:02:42.480> favorite<00:02:42.840> map<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.139> the<00:02:43.170> game<00:02:43.409> for<00:02:43.680> what

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
my favorite map in the game for what

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.210 
my favorite map in the game for what
it's<00:02:43.980> worth<00:02:44.959> because<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.139> just<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:46.859> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it's worth because it's just I like I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.909 
it's worth because it's just I like I
like<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.669> small<00:02:47.939> close-quarter<00:02:48.629> stuff

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
like it the small close-quarter stuff

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:53.899 
like it the small close-quarter stuff
but<00:02:49.919> um<00:02:50.569> it's<00:02:51.650> some<00:02:52.650> maps<00:02:52.859> like<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.669> not

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
but um it's some maps like this I do not

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.390 
but um it's some maps like this I do not
like<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.419> much<00:02:55.639> like<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> one<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.620> don't

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400

definitely by far the Maya favorite map
in<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> entire<00:03:08.099> game<00:03:08.459> because<00:03:08.969> every<00:03:09.329> time<00:03:09.359> I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
in the entire game because every time I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.690

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
up behind me when there were three of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.759 
up behind me when there were three of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.960 
them I couldn't shoot all three probably
should<00:03:22.919> i<00:03:22.949> stunned<00:03:23.310> them<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.699> would<00:03:23.849> have

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
should i stunned them that would have

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.640 
should i stunned them that would have
been<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> good<00:03:24.209> idea<00:03:24.329> but<00:03:25.019> here<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.319> call<00:03:25.530> them<00:03:25.590> my

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
been a good idea but here I call them my

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.210 
been a good idea but here I call them my
escort<00:03:26.159> airdrop<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:27.000> uh<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:28.709> waiting<00:03:29.069> for

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
escort airdrop and uh just waiting for

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.159 
escort airdrop and uh just waiting for
it<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.459> think<00:03:29.790> these<00:03:30.000> take<00:03:30.269> way<00:03:30.659> too<00:03:30.689> long<00:03:30.959> to

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
it I think these take way too long to

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.939 
it I think these take way too long to
get<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.840> get<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.139> I<00:03:34.169> mean<00:03:34.439> they<00:03:34.620> go<00:03:34.799> in

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
get to get to you I mean they go in

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.800 
get to get to you I mean they go in
circles<00:03:35.189> for<00:03:35.639> like<00:03:35.970> they<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:36.299> in<00:03:36.449> circles<00:03:36.599> like

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
circles for like they go in circles like

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.449 
circles for like they go in circles like
six<00:03:37.109> times<00:03:37.319> before<00:03:37.769> they<00:03:37.889> get<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.159> where<00:03:38.340> you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
six times before they get to where you

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.309 
six times before they get to where you
drop<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.030> thing<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.689> I<00:03:39.810> think<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.109> pretty

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
drop the thing and I think that's pretty

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.490 
drop the thing and I think that's pretty
stupid<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:41.010> shouldn't<00:03:41.280> take<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.699> long<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.959> it

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
stupid it shouldn't take this long so it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.719 
stupid it shouldn't take this long so it
shouldn't<00:03:43.859> take<00:03:43.919> this<00:03:44.099> long<00:03:44.159> for<00:03:44.370> them<00:03:44.669> to

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
shouldn't take this long for them to

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.780 
shouldn't take this long for them to
drop<00:03:45.090> your<00:03:45.239> care<00:03:45.479> packages<00:03:46.220> that's<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.430> like
