card slot one where you have 3G
connectivity<00:00:48.230> supported<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.190> can<00:00:49.460> create

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
connectivity supported so you can create

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.180 
connectivity supported so you can create
a<00:00:50.539> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.930> hotspot<00:00:51.140> out<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.829> 3G

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
a Wi-Fi hotspot out of the 3G

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.009 
a Wi-Fi hotspot out of the 3G
connectivity<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:53.120> can<00:00:53.149> also<00:00:53.449> do<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:53.960> with

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
connectivity you can also do that with

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.709 
connectivity you can also do that with
the<00:00:54.289> second<00:00:54.769> SIM<00:00:54.949> card<00:00:55.190> slot<00:00:55.460> which<00:00:56.059> support<00:00:56.570> a

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
the second SIM card slot which support a

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.930 
the second SIM card slot which support a
2g<00:00:57.079> SIM<00:00:57.260> card<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.739> from<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.280> as<00:00:58.550> well<00:00:58.760> you

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
2g SIM card and from that as well you

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.990 
2g SIM card and from that as well you
can<00:00:59.120> create<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.510> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.899> hotspot<00:01:00.550> so<00:01:01.550> taking<00:01:01.879> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
can create a Wi-Fi hotspot so taking a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.520 
can create a Wi-Fi hotspot so taking a
look<00:01:02.030> over<00:01:02.390> some<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.840> call<00:01:03.050> settings<00:01:03.410> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
look over some of the call settings I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.560 
look over some of the call settings I
can<00:01:03.559> show<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.009> that<00:01:04.309> this<00:01:04.580> device<00:01:04.910> does<00:01:05.360> give

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
can show you that this device does give

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.840 
can show you that this device does give
you<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.840> option<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.229> recording<00:01:06.860> any<00:01:07.460> voice

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you the option of recording any voice

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.999 
you the option of recording any voice
coil<00:01:08.119> which<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.570> make<00:01:09.020> from<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:09.470> device<00:01:09.770> or
