a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.140> too<00:01:37.439> big<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> Barbie<00:01:38.159> but

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
a little bit too big for a Barbie but

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.300 
a little bit too big for a Barbie but
they're<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:39.650> longer<00:01:40.650> than<00:01:41.100> they

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
they're just more longer than they

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.770 
they're just more longer than they
should<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> girls<00:01:42.180> hopefully<00:01:42.600> won't

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
should be but the girls hopefully won't

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.050 
should be but the girls hopefully won't
notice<00:01:42.930> again<00:01:43.350> they're<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.680> three<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> then
