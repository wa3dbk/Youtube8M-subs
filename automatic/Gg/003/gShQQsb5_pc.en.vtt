00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.570
 What on the day 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.310
 Today , change with Lam 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 by arm 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.350
 Anxiety 4 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.300
 To eloquence and baron 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 I'm going to get a wall 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 Yes, horticulture is here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.119
 Let's live with pines 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.350
 To go 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.030
 Yes I will beat forward 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.030
 Big 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 Big 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.270
 It's cool 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.000
 Follow 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.110
 Pine is 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.110
 It is cool no matter who 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.790
 After all the feeling of this hate is good 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.010
 There is no doubt that the sound 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.010
 Naa Fire Arms is amazing 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.450
 To the ogre 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.900
 Sorry have 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:23.110
 Following Baron, Mr. Ryugen also looks good with bread 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.110
 Then let's go to the next problem strawberry 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.520
 15 arms went 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.520
 Let's put it on 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.080
 Cute than yeah 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.940
 I'd have thought that I think we look good 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.940
 I do not read a little 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.270
 Let's say 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.270
 Want 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.800
 You get a face 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 Video is this 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.560
 What after all 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.480
 Naa's something a little weak likely 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 Because Bansa, which is more cute than the demo version, is red and black 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.380
 Poorer baggage is there 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.380
 It may have been noticeable 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.750
 After all 15 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.230
 I wonder if I have a feeling that something is stuck to my body 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.230
 Hard-to-work 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.360
 A bit here 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.170
 It seems like you are fluttering 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.410
 Well my body here is quite noticeable 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.660
 So 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.660
 It may seem a bit poor- 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.519
 There is a way magic 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.380
 Something from here 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.060
 2 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.060
 You may not be comfortable 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 The first mouse is still a little hard to wear 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.970
 So is the extra edition 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.220
