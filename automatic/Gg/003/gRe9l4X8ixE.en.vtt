stack<00:00:50.480> in<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.809> box

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
stack in a box

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.369 
stack in a box
kinda<00:00:52.550> like<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.760> iconic<00:00:53.120> Brown<00:00:53.540> sound<00:00:53.930> but

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
kinda like that iconic Brown sound but

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.720 
kinda like that iconic Brown sound but
the<00:00:54.470> unique<00:00:54.680> feature<00:00:54.920> here<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:55.339> we<00:00:55.519> have

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the unique feature here is that we have

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.970 
the unique feature here is that we have
built<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.330> Hall<00:00:56.660> reverb<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:57.680> kind<00:00:57.860> of<00:00:57.890> get

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
built in Hall reverb so you kind of get

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.490 
built in Hall reverb so you kind of get
that<00:00:58.040> whole<00:00:58.339> package<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:58.970> studio<00:00:59.480> sound<00:00:59.839> so

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
that whole package that studio sound so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.750 
that whole package that studio sound so
we're<00:01:00.860> going<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.040> take<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.220> look<00:01:01.370> some<00:01:01.489> tones

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
we're going to take a look some tones

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.840 
we're going to take a look some tones
twist<00:01:02.180> some<00:01:02.300> knobs<00:01:03.100> right<00:01:04.100> now<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.339> have<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
twist some knobs right now we have the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.999 
twist some knobs right now we have the
essentially<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.960> gain<00:01:06.229> knob<00:01:06.500> called<00:01:06.890> the

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
essentially the gain knob called the

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.160 
essentially the gain knob called the
brown<00:01:07.250> knob<00:01:07.700> set<00:01:08.420> pretty<00:01:08.659> low<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.080> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
brown knob set pretty low and the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.630 
brown knob set pretty low and the
president's<00:01:09.650> kind<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.890> dialed<00:01:10.190> back<00:01:10.340> for

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
president's kind of dialed back for

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.330 
president's kind of dialed back for
maybe<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.880> little<00:01:11.060> more<00:01:11.150> vintage<00:01:11.450> sound<00:01:12.310> take<00:01:13.310> a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
maybe a little more vintage sound take a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.820 
maybe a little more vintage sound take a
listen<00:01:13.580> I'll<00:01:14.270> turn<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.080> reverb<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.619> little

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
listen I'll turn in the reverb a little

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:32.410 
listen I'll turn in the reverb a little
bit<00:01:15.920> more<00:01:16.100> here<00:01:16.310> so

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.490 

I'll<00:01:33.420> mention<00:01:33.600> today<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:34.170> actually

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I'll mention today we're actually

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.910 
I'll mention today we're actually
plugged<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.070> Fender<00:01:35.520> Deluxe<00:01:35.549> reverb<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
plugged into a Fender Deluxe reverb and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.960 
plugged into a Fender Deluxe reverb and
actually<00:01:37.920> give<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.130> our<00:01:38.220> clean<00:01:38.460> tone<00:01:38.729> real

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
actually give you our clean tone real

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
actually give you our clean tone real
quick<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.509> we'll<00:01:39.659> switch<00:01:39.750> over<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> some

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
quick and then we'll switch over to some

00:01:40.320 --> 00:02:11.339 
quick and then we'll switch over to some
single

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.270 

and<00:02:12.349> you<00:02:12.409> give<00:02:12.530> us<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.650> little<00:02:12.769> bit<00:02:12.920> more<00:02:13.099> gain

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and you give us a little bit more gain

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.820 
and you give us a little bit more gain
on<00:02:13.519> tap<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.870> trick<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.379> is<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.620> kind

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
on tap and the the trick here is to kind

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.039 
on tap and the the trick here is to kind
of<00:02:15.860> utilize<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.760> volume<00:02:17.209> on<00:02:17.390> your<00:02:17.510> guitar<00:02:17.659> to

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
of utilize the volume on your guitar to

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.110 
of utilize the volume on your guitar to
get<00:02:18.170> those<00:02:18.349> in-between<00:02:18.560> sounds<00:02:19.519> so<00:02:19.700> we're

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
get those in-between sounds so we're

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.640 
get those in-between sounds so we're
gonna<00:02:20.209> set<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.659> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.959> bit<00:02:21.080> hotter<00:02:21.319> here

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
gonna set this a little bit hotter here

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.930 
gonna set this a little bit hotter here
give<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.980> little<00:02:22.069> bit<00:02:22.190> more<00:02:22.310> presents

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
give it a little bit more presents

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.850 
give it a little bit more presents
we're<00:02:23.330> going<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> dial<00:02:23.720> back<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.200> volume<00:02:24.620> on

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
we're going to dial back the volume on

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:58.900 
we're going to dial back the volume on
the<00:02:24.920> guitar<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.370> see<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:26.360> get

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.990
