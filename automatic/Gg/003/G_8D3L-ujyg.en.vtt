video it's going to be about how to make
my<00:00:10.260> little<00:00:10.440> halo<00:00:11.250> grunt<00:00:11.969> right<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> as

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
my little halo grunt right here so as

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.189 
my little halo grunt right here so as
you<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:14.969> see<00:00:15.210> right<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> little

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
you can see right here this a little

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.130 
you can see right here this a little
marine<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.130> grunt<00:00:17.400> size<00:00:17.910> comparison<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:18.990> i

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
marine to grunt size comparison which i

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.189 
marine to grunt size comparison which i
think<00:00:19.230> looks<00:00:19.770> pretty<00:00:20.189> accurate<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.670> game

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
think looks pretty accurate to the game

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
think looks pretty accurate to the game

going to need is going to be one of
these<00:01:06.110> little<00:01:07.110> pieces<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:08.010> stud<00:01:08.220> connectors

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
these little pieces with stud connectors

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
these little pieces with stud connectors
all<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> top<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.250> should<00:01:11.250> go

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
all around it on the top that should go

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.359 
all around it on the top that should go
right<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:16.340> then<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
right on that just like that then you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
right on that just like that then you
want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:18.140> two<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> these<00:01:19.439> pieces<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
want to take two of these pieces and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
want to take two of these pieces and
those<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.630> each<00:01:22.049> side<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:24.920> ah<00:01:26.450> give<00:01:27.450> me

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
those go in each side of this ah give me

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:39.740 
those go in each side of this ah give me
a<00:01:27.600> sec

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.900 

so<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:41.260> have<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:42.340> out<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.880> shape<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.490> then

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
so you have that out of shape and then

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.960 
so you have that out of shape and then
take<00:01:47.340> two<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.370> these<00:01:49.350> kind<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.410> pieces<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
take two of these kind of pieces and

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.580 
take two of these kind of pieces and
those<00:01:52.300> should<00:01:52.900> go<00:01:53.140> right<00:01:53.800> here<00:01:55.170> both<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.470> them

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
those should go right here both of them

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.690 
those should go right here both of them
on<00:01:56.830> each<00:01:56.860> side<00:01:57.310> and<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:03.100> take<00:02:03.310> two<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.490> these

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
on each side and then take two of these

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.940 
on each side and then take two of these
and<00:02:03.900> those<00:02:04.900> should<00:02:05.110> go<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.590> these<00:02:07.739> both<00:02:08.739> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
and those should go in these both of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.240 
and those should go in these both of
them<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.959> have<00:02:11.170> sort<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.100> body<00:02:12.850> and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
them so you have sort of the body and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.740 
them so you have sort of the body and
then<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:17.560> grunt<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:19.090> minor

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
then this grunt is going to be a minor

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.080 
then this grunt is going to be a minor
grunt<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.709> if<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.489> switch<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.820> colors

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
grunt but if you just switch the colors

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.600 
grunt but if you just switch the colors
of<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.510> chest<00:02:22.930> plate<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:24.010> back<00:02:24.190> tank<00:02:24.489> you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
of the chest plate and the back tank you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.130 
of the chest plate and the back tank you
can<00:02:24.760> make<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.090> different<00:02:26.020> ranks<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
can make it different ranks but so you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.580 
can make it different ranks but so you
need<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.709> these<00:02:29.830> pieces<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.270> then<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.560> of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
need one of these pieces and then one of

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.070 
need one of these pieces and then one of
these<00:02:32.800> triangular<00:02:33.400> prism<00:02:33.730> pieces<00:02:34.150> that

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
these triangular prism pieces that

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.100 
these triangular prism pieces that
should<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.410> right<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:36.220> right<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.209> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
should go right there right like that it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.860 
should go right there right like that it
should<00:02:38.350> go<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.769> his<00:02:39.280> back<00:02:40.049> just<00:02:41.049> like<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
should go on his back just like that and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.080 
should go on his back just like that and
then<00:02:44.530> just<00:02:44.560> take<00:02:44.830> an<00:02:44.950> orange<00:02:45.160> smooth<00:02:45.760> piece

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
then just take an orange smooth piece

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.920 
then just take an orange smooth piece
and<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.049> should<00:02:47.230> go<00:02:47.380> right<00:02:47.739> right<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:50.230> there

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and that should go right right in there

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.240 
and that should go right right in there
just<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.959> then<00:02:55.959> take<00:02:56.320> one<00:02:56.650> of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
just like that and then take one of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.470 
just like that and then take one of
these<00:02:57.810> little<00:02:58.810> bill<00:02:59.940> sticking<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.360> that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
these little bill sticking out and that
