hardness isn't really that important to
take<00:01:56.820> live<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> hard<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.540> soft<00:01:57.750> water

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
take live in hard and soft water

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.780 
take live in hard and soft water
I<00:01:58.170> wouldn't<00:01:58.829> go<00:01:58.890> extremely<00:01:59.250> hard<00:01:59.549> though

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I wouldn't go extremely hard though

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.959 
I wouldn't go extremely hard though
because<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:01.219> don't<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.759> tolerate

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
because I don't think they can tolerate

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.420 
because I don't think they can tolerate
that<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.799> flexible<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.399> terms

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that but they are flexible in terms

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.850 
that but they are flexible in terms
hardness<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.899> temperature<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.469> prefer

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
hardness as for temperature they prefer

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339 
hardness as for temperature they prefer
temperature<00:02:08.220> between<00:02:08.429> 1826<00:02:09.330> degrees<00:02:09.599> these

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
temperature between 1826 degrees these

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.580 
temperature between 1826 degrees these
guys<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.890> 23<00:02:11.400> degrees<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:12.060> now

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
guys are at 23 degrees right now

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.670 
guys are at 23 degrees right now
and<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:14.810> community<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.200> community<00:02:16.290> fish

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
and for community as the community fish

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.320 
and for community as the community fish
I<00:02:16.980> don't<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:17.610> these<00:02:17.700> guys<00:02:17.819> make<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> best

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I don't think these guys make the best

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.790 
I don't think these guys make the best
community<00:02:18.599> fish<00:02:18.750> because<00:02:19.110> they're<00:02:19.319> very<00:02:19.500> shy

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
community fish because they're very shy

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.949 
community fish because they're very shy
you<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:21.239> they're<00:02:21.480> outgoing

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
you can see right now they're outgoing

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.900 
you can see right now they're outgoing
and<00:02:22.170> everything<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.520> they've<00:02:23.640> kind<00:02:23.819> of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and everything and they've kind of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.400 
and everything and they've kind of
gotten<00:02:24.120> used<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.540> me<00:02:24.660> moving<00:02:24.930> around<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.260> room

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
gotten used to me moving around the room

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.470 
gotten used to me moving around the room
but<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.950> took<00:02:26.069> about<00:02:26.220> two<00:02:26.520> weeks<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.120> end<00:02:27.390> up

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
but it took about two weeks in to end up

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.350 
but it took about two weeks in to end up
like<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.830> they<00:02:28.830> became<00:02:29.040> outgoing<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:30.060> if

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
like that they became outgoing now if

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.670 
like that they became outgoing now if
you're<00:02:30.510> gonna<00:02:30.630> keep<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:30.900> community<00:02:31.260> fish<00:02:31.410> need

you're gonna keep my community fish need
to<00:02:31.769> keeping<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.069> other<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.670> small<00:02:32.910> fish

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to keeping with other really small fish

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.259 
to keeping with other really small fish
are<00:02:33.390> they're<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.260> peaceful<00:02:34.500> fish<00:02:34.800> also<00:02:35.269> so

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
are they're really peaceful fish also so

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.790 
are they're really peaceful fish also so
one<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> main<00:02:37.050> things<00:02:37.260> these<00:02:37.380> guys<00:02:37.440> kept

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
one of the main things these guys kept

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
one of the main things these guys kept
in<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.069> community<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.580> they're<00:02:38.790> kept<00:02:38.970> with

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
in the community is they're kept with

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.890 
in the community is they're kept with
shrimp<00:02:40.700> such<00:02:41.700> as<00:02:41.910> our<00:02:42.090> red<00:02:42.480> cherry<00:02:42.750> shrimp

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
shrimp such as our red cherry shrimp

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.190 
shrimp such as our red cherry shrimp
Crystal<00:02:43.739> shrimp<00:02:43.950> excetera

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
Crystal shrimp excetera

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.240 
Crystal shrimp excetera
and<00:02:46.200> there's<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.410> few<00:02:46.560> our<00:02:46.650> species<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.069> shrimp

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and there's a few our species of shrimp

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.530 
and there's a few our species of shrimp
you<00:02:47.430> keep<00:02:47.640> them<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.239> some<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
you keep them with and some of the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.080 
you keep them with and some of the
shrimp<00:02:48.810> actually<00:02:49.200> produce<00:02:50.190> food<00:02:50.580> freeze<00:02:50.850> guys

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
shrimp actually produce food freeze guys

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.150 
shrimp actually produce food freeze guys
and<00:02:51.450> some<00:02:51.630> shrimp<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:52.080> lay<00:02:52.319> eggs<00:02:52.560> constantly

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and some shrimp they lay eggs constantly

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.190 
and some shrimp they lay eggs constantly
and<00:02:53.430> then<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> scarbacks<00:02:54.510> will<00:02:54.780> eat<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> eggs

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
and then the scarbacks will eat the eggs

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.240 
and then the scarbacks will eat the eggs
and<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> larvae<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.470> find<00:02:58.709> they<00:02:58.830> also<00:02:58.950> go

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and the larvae and I find they also go

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.490 
and the larvae and I find they also go
they<00:02:59.549> obviously<00:02:59.640> go<00:02:59.940> great<00:03:00.180> with<00:03:00.209> snails<00:03:00.569> some

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
they obviously go great with snails some

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.259 
they obviously go great with snails some
snail<00:03:01.739> species<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.340> quite<00:03:02.670> well<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
snail species do quite well so with the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.940 
snail species do quite well so with the
buys<00:03:03.420> because<00:03:03.870> again<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.319> snails<00:03:04.560> kind<00:03:04.890> of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
buys because again the snails kind of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.440 
buys because again the snails kind of
will<00:03:05.069> make<00:03:05.250> food<00:03:05.519> for<00:03:05.549> your<00:03:05.849> bags<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.360> an

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
will make food for your bags to an

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.330 
will make food for your bags to an
extent<00:03:06.750> because<00:03:07.410> they<00:03:07.530> all<00:03:07.650> produce<00:03:07.830> eggs<00:03:08.099> and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
extent because they all produce eggs and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.910 
extent because they all produce eggs and
larvae<00:03:08.640> which<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> dice<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:09.599> eat

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
larvae which is the dice and then eat

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.199 
larvae which is the dice and then eat
now<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:11.190> peripheral<00:03:11.580> house<00:03:11.819> them<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.060> other

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
now as peripheral house them with other

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.460 
now as peripheral house them with other
fish<00:03:12.830> well<00:03:13.830> I've<00:03:14.040> read<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.630> best<00:03:15.959> fish<00:03:16.230> that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
fish well I've read the best fish that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
fish well I've read the best fish that
seems<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.920> going<00:03:17.130> with<00:03:17.250> these<00:03:17.310> guys<00:03:17.519> who

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
seems to be going with these guys who

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.180 
seems to be going with these guys who
beat<00:03:18.030> tiny<00:03:18.450> loaches<00:03:18.930> some<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.920> dwarf

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
beat tiny loaches some of the dwarf

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.370 
beat tiny loaches some of the dwarf
loaches<00:03:20.790> worked<00:03:21.750> really<00:03:21.959> well

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
loaches worked really well

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.960 
loaches worked really well
another<00:03:22.950> thing<00:03:23.130> probably<00:03:23.400> works<00:03:23.579> three<00:03:23.760> well

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
another thing probably works three well

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.020 
another thing probably works three well
is<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.209> coulee<00:03:24.510> loach<00:03:25.310> neon<00:03:26.310> tetras<00:03:26.730> probably

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
is the coulee loach neon tetras probably

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.199 
is the coulee loach neon tetras probably
work<00:03:27.120> quite<00:03:27.390> well<00:03:27.420> also<00:03:29.450> micro<00:03:30.450> res<00:03:30.600> bores<00:03:32.209> no

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
work quite well also micro res bores no

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.130 
work quite well also micro res bores no
betas<00:03:33.600> because<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> basal<00:03:34.590> eat<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:34.859> guys

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
betas because the basal eat these guys

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.240 
betas because the basal eat these guys
probably<00:03:37.140> honey<00:03:37.500> Grammys<00:03:37.859> are<00:03:37.950> pray<00:03:38.069> also

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
probably honey Grammys are pray also

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.099 
probably honey Grammys are pray also
work<00:03:38.549> but<00:03:39.269> they're<00:03:39.420> laying<00:03:39.510> aggression<00:03:39.959> from

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
work but they're laying aggression from

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.120 
work but they're laying aggression from
the<00:03:40.200> hanging<00:03:40.319> Grammys<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:40.950> remove

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the hanging Grammys you have to remove

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
the hanging Grammys you have to remove
them<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:43.579> basically<00:03:44.579> if<00:03:44.790> you're<00:03:44.910> gonna<00:03:45.030> keep

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
them and basically if you're gonna keep

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.610 
them and basically if you're gonna keep
them<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.329> small<00:03:45.810> shoulder<00:03:46.200> make<00:03:46.380> sure<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
them a small shoulder make sure the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.670 
them a small shoulder make sure the
shoulder<00:03:47.010> isn't<00:03:47.190> really<00:03:47.700> fast<00:03:48.120> moving

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
shoulder isn't really fast moving

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.930 
shoulder isn't really fast moving
because<00:03:49.680> like<00:03:49.859> they<00:03:50.519> won't<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.760> able<00:03:50.819> to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
because like they won't be able to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.160 
because like they won't be able to
compete<00:03:51.150> for<00:03:51.299> food<00:03:51.450> with<00:03:51.660> something<00:03:51.959> like<00:03:52.139> a

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
compete for food with something like a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.410 
compete for food with something like a
zebra<00:03:53.100> dana<00:03:53.280> or<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.639> pearl<00:03:54.180> Dino<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:56.239> have<00:03:57.239> also

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
zebra dana or a pearl Dino I have also

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.789 
zebra dana or a pearl Dino I have also
heard<00:03:57.690> about<00:03:57.720> people<00:03:58.230> keeping<00:03:58.380> these<00:03:58.560> guys

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
heard about people keeping these guys

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.879 
heard about people keeping these guys
and<00:03:59.190> tanks<00:03:59.489> with<00:03:59.670> glowlight<00:04:00.329> Dino's<00:04:01.019> and

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
and tanks with glowlight Dino's and

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.420 
and tanks with glowlight Dino's and
celestial<00:04:02.730> pearl<00:04:02.880> Tainos<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.980> that's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
celestial pearl Tainos so that's

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.280 
celestial pearl Tainos so that's
basically<00:04:05.910> these<00:04:06.420> guys<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.870> think<00:04:06.900> these<00:04:07.139> guys

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
basically these guys I think these guys

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.830 
basically these guys I think these guys
pray<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.590> best<00:04:07.859> kept<00:04:08.069> in<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.310> species<00:04:08.670> tank<00:04:08.940> or

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
pray just best kept in a species tank or

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.400 
pray just best kept in a species tank or

there are territorial fish the males are

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.810 
there are territorial fish the males are
aggressive<00:04:18.030> towards<00:04:18.239> each<00:04:18.359> other<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.519> only

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
aggressive towards each other so I only

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.370 
aggressive towards each other so I only
have<00:04:21.030> two<00:04:21.209> these<00:04:21.359> guys<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.780> air<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.080> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
have two these guys in the air and I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.870 
have two these guys in the air and I
don't<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.130> I'd<00:04:23.220> probably<00:04:23.370> keep<00:04:23.610> more<00:04:23.789> in

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
don't think I'd probably keep more in

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
a 16-inch tank and there's probably not

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.469 
a 16-inch tank and there's probably not
enough<00:04:30.710> room<00:04:30.860> for<00:04:30.979> them<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.220> form<00:04:31.490> he's<00:04:32.300> about

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
tank I probably have gotten away would

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.909 
tank I probably have gotten away would
out<00:05:05.660> using<00:05:05.900> a<00:05:05.990> filter<00:05:06.199> on<00:05:06.440> here<00:05:06.470> because<00:05:06.800> the

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
out using a filter on here because the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.249 
out using a filter on here because the
plants<00:05:07.280> cuz<00:05:08.120> I've<00:05:08.300> taken<00:05:08.539> everything<00:05:08.900> but<00:05:09.229> I

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
think it's best to stick with filtration

think it's best to stick with filtration
