tank<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.720> let's<00:00:25.230> take<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> look<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
tank so let's take a look at all the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
tank so let's take a look at all the
bits<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.340> pieces<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> how<00:00:27.689> you

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
bits and pieces that you get and how you

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.120 
bits and pieces that you get and how you
put<00:00:27.990> together<00:00:28.050> how<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> fill<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.070> then

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
put together how you fill it and then

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.479 
put together how you fill it and then
we'll<00:00:29.820> take<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> look<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.179> work<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> let's<00:00:32.369> take

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
we'll take a look at work so let's take

with<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:47.969> lexan<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> dual<00:00:50.039> coil

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
with the lexan you get a dual coil

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150 
with the lexan you get a dual coil
cartomizer<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.690> been<00:00:52.289> punched<00:00:52.980> with

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
cartomizer that's been punched with

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.180 
cartomizer that's been punched with
either<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.430> drill<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.090> nail<00:00:54.559> on<00:00:55.559> either<00:00:55.800> side

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
either a drill or a nail on either side

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.400 
either a drill or a nail on either side
to<00:00:56.219> allow<00:00:56.760> flow<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.329> juice<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
to allow flow of juice into the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
to allow flow of juice into the
cartomizer<00:00:58.739> itself<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.730> little<00:01:00.539> hole

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
cartomizer itself and that little hole

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.410 
cartomizer itself and that little hole
should<00:01:00.930> sit<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.469> above<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> delrin<00:01:02.219> tap<00:01:02.460> now

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
should sit just above the delrin tap now

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.080 
should sit just above the delrin tap now
because<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> comes<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> mouthpiece<00:01:05.090> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
because it comes with a mouthpiece we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.109 
because it comes with a mouthpiece we
don't<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.080> need<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.729> plastic<00:01:08.729> bit<00:01:08.909> there

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
don't really need that plastic bit there

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.469 
don't really need that plastic bit there
so<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:10.200> our<00:01:10.320> handy<00:01:10.650> open<00:01:10.979> paperclip<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.790> pop

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so get our handy open paperclip and pop

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.770 
so get our handy open paperclip and pop
that<00:01:12.510> puppy<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:17.130> ready<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.780> sup

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

first things first put the card miser
inside<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> delrin<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.470> sometimes<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.490> on

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
inside the delrin I sometimes do this on

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
inside the delrin I sometimes do this on
a<00:01:23.670> dead<00:01:23.939> old<00:01:24.150> ego<00:01:24.600> battery<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.500> slip<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
a dead old ego battery and then slip the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.490 
a dead old ego battery and then slip the
cap<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.460> below<00:01:27.450> those<00:01:27.630> holes<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> juice

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
cap down below those holes and the juice

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.550 
cap down below those holes and the juice
will<00:01:28.710> sit<00:01:28.950> inside<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.579> flow<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.560> then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
will sit inside there and flow in then

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
will sit inside there and flow in then
we're<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> pick<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> lexan<00:01:32.939> tube

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
we're going to pick up the lexan tube

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.910 
we're going to pick up the lexan tube
and<00:01:33.689> kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> wiggle<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and kind of wiggle that on to the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
and kind of wiggle that on to the
cartomizer<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.810> ahead<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.990> put

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
cartomizer then we can go ahead and put

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.530 
cartomizer then we can go ahead and put
a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.200> liquid<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> car<00:01:38.189> dough<00:01:38.310> itself

just<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> started<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:44.549> ahead

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
just to get it started and then go ahead

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.349 
just to get it started and then go ahead
and<00:01:45.090> fill<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.810> tank<00:01:46.079> itself

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
not all the way we will room at the top

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.100 
not all the way we will room at the top
for<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.020> other<00:02:01.409> domain<00:02:01.890> cap<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.220> come<00:02:02.400> in<00:02:03.110> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
for the other domain cap to come in and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.710 
for the other domain cap to come in and
I<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.650> Lube<00:02:05.250> around<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> edges<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> cap

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
I will Lube around the edges of the cap

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.120 
I will Lube around the edges of the cap

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
the top cap there and then even it off

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.350 
the top cap there and then even it off
so<00:04:55.340> let's<00:04:55.490> flush<00:04:55.850> on<00:04:56.090> both<00:04:56.300> sides<00:04:57.699> any<00:04:58.699> mess

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
so let's flush on both sides any mess

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.659 
so let's flush on both sides any mess
you<00:04:59.540> may<00:04:59.690> have<00:04:59.840> made<00:05:00.050> out<00:05:00.320> go<00:05:01.100> ahead<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.460> put

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
you may have made out go ahead and put

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.110 
you may have made out go ahead and put
the<00:05:01.880> drip<00:05:02.210> tip<00:05:02.419> in<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:04.040> have<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.550> solid

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
the drip tip in and you have a solid

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:15.390 
the drip tip in and you have a solid

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.070 

here's<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.490> look<00:05:16.729> at<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.060> two<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.419> them<00:05:17.630> side<00:05:18.050> by

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
here's a look at the two of them side by

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.560 
here's a look at the two of them side by
side<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:19.400> stainless<00:05:19.760> steel<00:05:20.240> is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
side the stainless steel is

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.570 
side the stainless steel is
significantly<00:05:21.350> heavier<00:05:21.680> than<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.220> delrin

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
significantly heavier than the delrin

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.469 
significantly heavier than the delrin
but<00:05:23.539> they<00:05:23.690> are<00:05:23.979> virtually<00:05:24.979> identical

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
but they are virtually identical

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.350 
but they are virtually identical
different<00:05:26.479> mouthpieces<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:27.139> course<00:05:28.210> but<00:05:29.210> they

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
different mouthpieces of course but they

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.140 
different mouthpieces of course but they
are<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.600> same<00:05:29.780> size<00:05:30.639> just<00:05:31.639> made<00:05:31.880> of<00:05:32.000> different

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
are the same size just made of different

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.600 
are the same size just made of different
material<00:05:32.720> and<00:05:32.900> they<00:05:33.710> function<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.190> same<00:05:36.610> so

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
material and they function the same so

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.860 
material and they function the same so

clouds<00:05:47.330> of<00:05:47.450> vapor<00:05:47.510> calm<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.460> assume<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
clouds of vapor calm I assume the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.000 
clouds of vapor calm I assume the
stainless<00:05:49.970> will<00:05:50.150> be<00:05:50.240> available<00:05:50.660> shortly<00:05:51.050> what

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
stainless will be available shortly what

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.610 
stainless will be available shortly what
I<00:05:52.039> really<00:05:52.370> like<00:05:52.550> about<00:05:52.580> them<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.060> that

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
I really like about them is that

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.409 
I really like about them is that
internal<00:05:54.620> oring<00:05:55.130> that's<00:05:55.610> around<00:05:55.849> the<00:05:55.970> inside

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
internal oring that's around the inside

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.560 
internal oring that's around the inside
that's<00:05:56.979> kind<00:05:57.979> of<00:05:58.070> holding<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.550> ce2<00:05:59.030> a<00:05:59.060> little

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
that's kind of holding the ce2 a little

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.680 
that's kind of holding the ce2 a little
more<00:06:00.440> firmly<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.220> providing<00:06:02.000> an<00:06:02.090> extra<00:06:02.449> seal

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
more firmly and providing an extra seal

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.839 
more firmly and providing an extra seal
I<00:06:02.930> mean<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.560> liquidator<00:06:04.010> works<00:06:04.699> great<00:06:05.270> but<00:06:06.020> it

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
I mean the liquidator works great but it

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.640 
I mean the liquidator works great but it
slides<00:06:07.849> so<00:06:08.419> easily<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:09.169> the<00:06:09.410> only<00:06:09.530> thing

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
slides so easily and the only thing

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.020 
slides so easily and the only thing
really<00:06:09.889> holding<00:06:10.250> it<00:06:10.370> in<00:06:10.430> place<00:06:10.550> is<00:06:10.849> that

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
really holding it in place is that

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.689 
really holding it in place is that
mouthpiece<00:06:11.590> so<00:06:12.590> I'm<00:06:12.770> just<00:06:12.979> afraid<00:06:13.220> that<00:06:13.340> I<00:06:13.520> can

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
mouthpiece so I'm just afraid that I can

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.879 
mouthpiece so I'm just afraid that I can
pop<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.330> drip<00:06:14.780> tip<00:06:15.020> right<00:06:15.199> off<00:06:15.260> and<00:06:15.710> I'll

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
pop that drip tip right off and I'll

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.850 
pop that drip tip right off and I'll
have<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.099> little<00:06:16.400> shower<00:06:16.639> juice<00:06:17.060> all<00:06:17.270> over

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
have a little shower juice all over

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.040 
have a little shower juice all over
these<00:06:18.860> still<00:06:19.220> move<00:06:19.520> easily<00:06:20.060> enough<00:06:20.599> when<00:06:20.900> you

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
these still move easily enough when you

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.230 
these still move easily enough when you
need<00:06:21.199> them<00:06:21.380> too<00:06:21.620> but<00:06:22.220> that<00:06:22.280> Oh<00:06:22.580> ring<00:06:22.820> is<00:06:23.000> just

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
need them too but that Oh ring is just

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.879 
need them too but that Oh ring is just
providing<00:06:23.660> a<00:06:23.720> little<00:06:23.990> extra<00:06:24.349> pressure<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:24.860> a

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
providing a little extra pressure and a

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.450 
providing a little extra pressure and a
little<00:06:25.099> better<00:06:25.280> seal<00:06:25.720> and<00:06:26.720> of<00:06:27.650> course<00:06:27.919> my<00:06:28.190> kids

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
little better seal and of course my kids

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:37.490 
little better seal and of course my kids
will<00:06:28.580> call<00:06:28.820> cartomizer<00:06:29.360> they<00:06:29.690> vape<00:06:29.960> great

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.590 

the<00:06:38.430> flavor<00:06:38.700> is<00:06:38.790> really<00:06:38.850> good<00:06:39.210> because<00:06:39.330> you're

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
the flavor is really good because you're

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.000 
the flavor is really good because you're
always<00:06:39.780> keeping<00:06:40.020> that<00:06:40.290> wet<00:06:40.530> and<00:06:40.770> you're

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
always keeping that wet and you're

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.610 
always keeping that wet and you're
always<00:06:41.220> pulling<00:06:41.520> it<00:06:41.730> in<00:06:42.290> you<00:06:43.290> know<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.470> nice

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
always pulling it in you know the nice

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.530 
always pulling it in you know the nice
thing<00:06:43.800> about<00:06:43.860> them<00:06:44.160> is<00:06:44.310> unlike<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:45.000> sea<00:06:45.240> to

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
thing about them is unlike the sea to

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.390 
thing about them is unlike the sea to
base<00:06:45.750> tanks<00:06:46.290> where<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.650> liquid<00:06:46.860> could<00:06:47.130> get

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
base tanks where the liquid could get

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.730 
base tanks where the liquid could get
into<00:06:47.790> the<00:06:48.030> coil<00:06:48.420> and<00:06:48.720> then<00:06:49.230> run<00:06:49.470> down<00:06:49.710> that

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
into the coil and then run down that

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.410 
into the coil and then run down that
post<00:06:50.160> and<00:06:50.340> turn<00:06:50.520> right<00:06:50.670> at<00:06:50.820> the<00:06:50.850> connector

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
post and turn right at the connector

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.660 
post and turn right at the connector
these<00:06:52.140> don't<00:06:52.410> do<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:52.740> so<00:06:53.010> I<00:06:53.040> can<00:06:53.370> keep<00:06:53.550> these

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
these don't do that so I can keep these

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.190 
these don't do that so I can keep these
on<00:06:53.820> my<00:06:53.850> passenger<00:06:54.390> seat<00:06:54.600> and<00:06:54.690> I<00:06:54.750> don't<00:06:54.930> worry

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
on my passenger seat and I don't worry

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.690 
on my passenger seat and I don't worry
about<00:06:55.230> trying<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:55.650> keep<00:06:55.800> him<00:06:55.920> upright<00:06:56.130> so<00:06:56.580> we

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
about trying to keep him upright so we

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.140 
about trying to keep him upright so we
don't<00:06:56.850> have<00:06:56.940> leaks<00:06:58.340> the<00:06:59.340> stainless<00:06:59.790> steel<00:07:00.000> is

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
don't have leaks the stainless steel is

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.960 
don't have leaks the stainless steel is
much<00:07:00.480> heavier<00:07:00.780> than<00:07:00.990> the<00:07:01.320> delrin<00:07:01.680> version<00:07:02.100> it

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
much heavier than the delrin version it

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.870 
much heavier than the delrin version it
does<00:07:03.210> it<00:07:04.140> goes<00:07:04.350> together<00:07:04.560> a<00:07:04.890> little<00:07:05.160> easier<00:07:05.640> I

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
does it goes together a little easier I

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.360 
does it goes together a little easier I
don't<00:07:06.600> know<00:07:06.690> if<00:07:06.810> that's<00:07:06.990> because<00:07:07.110> it's<00:07:07.650> metal

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
don't know if that's because it's metal

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.570 
don't know if that's because it's metal
and<00:07:09.050> what<00:07:10.050> but<00:07:10.320> I<00:07:10.470> just<00:07:10.710> think<00:07:10.890> it<00:07:11.010> looks<00:07:11.310> a

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
and what but I just think it looks a

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.820 
and what but I just think it looks a
little<00:07:11.790> cooler<00:07:12.150> so<00:07:12.690> hopefully<00:07:13.110> these<00:07:13.500> will<00:07:13.560> be

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
little cooler so hopefully these will be

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:23.999 
little cooler so hopefully these will be
available<00:07:14.250> shortly<00:07:14.850> as<00:07:15.270> well

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.209 

I<00:07:24.610> do<00:07:25.449> kind<00:07:25.960> of<00:07:26.050> think<00:07:26.349> that<00:07:26.499> while<00:07:26.830> this<00:07:27.039> one

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.219 
I do kind of think that while this one

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.399 
I do kind of think that while this one
came<00:07:27.490> with<00:07:27.669> a<00:07:27.699> black<00:07:28.029> ce2<00:07:28.719> to<00:07:28.990> put<00:07:29.169> in<00:07:29.259> there

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.409 
came with a black ce2 to put in there

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:30.899 
came with a black ce2 to put in there
that<00:07:29.619> I<00:07:29.710> would<00:07:29.860> actually<00:07:30.009> use<00:07:30.279> only<00:07:30.729> the

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:30.909 
that I would actually use only the

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.889 
that I would actually use only the
stainless<00:07:31.409> in<00:07:32.409> both<00:07:32.710> units<00:07:33.159> just<00:07:34.059> because<00:07:34.389> in

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:34.899 
stainless in both units just because in

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:37.139 
stainless in both units just because in
pushing<00:07:35.259> the<00:07:35.529> donor<00:07:35.800> in<00:07:35.949> top<00:07:36.189> onto<00:07:36.699> this<00:07:36.879> I

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:37.149 
pushing the donor in top onto this I

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.480 
pushing the donor in top onto this I
noticed<00:07:37.839> that<00:07:37.899> the<00:07:38.199> the<00:07:38.529> sticker<00:07:39.219> that's

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490 
noticed that the the sticker that's

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.100 
noticed that the the sticker that's
around<00:07:39.699> the<00:07:39.819> outside<00:07:40.149> of<00:07:40.180> the<00:07:40.330> black<00:07:40.569> started

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
around the outside of the black started

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.529 
around the outside of the black started
to<00:07:41.169> peel<00:07:41.409> off<00:07:41.469> so<00:07:41.979> I<00:07:42.189> think<00:07:43.119> it's<00:07:43.389> probably

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:43.539 
to peel off so I think it's probably

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.019 
to peel off so I think it's probably
going<00:07:43.990> to<00:07:44.050> push<00:07:44.559> into<00:07:44.800> the<00:07:44.949> case<00:07:45.219> easier<00:07:45.669> and

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:46.029 
going to push into the case easier and

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:47.939 
going to push into the case easier and
be<00:07:46.539> less<00:07:46.749> messy<00:07:47.169> in<00:07:47.289> the<00:07:47.379> long<00:07:47.529> run<00:07:47.559> if<00:07:47.860> you

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:47.949 
be less messy in the long run if you

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:50.129 
be less messy in the long run if you
just<00:07:48.159> used<00:07:48.339> to<00:07:48.460> stainless<00:07:48.699> steel<00:07:49.029> inside<00:07:49.899> once

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139 
just used to stainless steel inside once

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:54.449 
just used to stainless steel inside once
but<00:07:50.379> they<00:07:51.339> are<00:07:51.639> pretty<00:07:52.059> winning
