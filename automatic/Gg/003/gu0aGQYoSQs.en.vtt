00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.790
 the poetological Zocker series is entering a new round this year 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:10.619
 no wonder 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.189
 However, the current part with the addition of 2012 should be something more 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.609
 To get attention 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.970
 finally, the big competitor FIFA in recent years set the tone 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.820
 indicates that rejected 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.909
 This year it should change again 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.599
 Among other things, with a drilled artificial intelligence at the 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.710
 revised control and the renewed claim the most realistic 

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:31.729
 To launch football simulation on the planet 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.220
 whether the sanctions are enough to recapture the football throne 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.220
 our test video shows 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.220
 it is 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.140
 As every year, there is a lot in the last summer of 2012 as well 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.789
 music 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.430
 by stepping out into the world of football 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 fast nets are possible as well as the delivery of a child 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.920
 Anyone who wants to buy something deeper in the real player material tries in 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 both modes become legendary 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.610
 In the former, you control a single player through a whole career 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.490
 Coincidence plays a role on the pitch not interested 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.350
 that was due to the limited of it was a bit annoying at first 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.890
 appear 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.890
 turns out to be worth playing international matches 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.190
 The result was a complete success, one of the most abundant at least felt 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 significantly larger 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.350
 in masterly mode, on the other hand, it is the task of a whole club in the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.080
 To establish world class 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.250
 along with all the important elements like player transfers training taz play 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.520
 Communications press conferences and so on and so forth 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.600
 a very complex mode of just going through training and handling 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 With players and caregivers interior depth has to offer 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.080
 Like every year, most songs mode is the perfect way to team up 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.510
 to develop in the long term 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.180
 However, who wants it a financially brand wants the new club-boss mode 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.960
 Here you are mainly concerned with the financial aspects of a club 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.410
 So do not even interfere with the game on the pitch 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.530
 Modes are told in cutscenes but they seem a bit static 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 and in addition to the confusing menus rather negatively 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.510
 dpa 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.630
 the return of the Challenge training best especially veteran of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.979
 Series look a little less books you have to for example in the hat 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.349
 dribble or hit certain segments in goal for free kicks 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.849
 The motivated scary is also quite difficult and demanding 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.489
 On the square itself, PES 2012 then shows off its chocolate side 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.529
 Still, it is a very accurate implementation phase of sport 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.109
 but this year through numerous revisions but again 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.029
 much better plays there would be on the one hand, the revised artificial 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.309
 Intelligence that you are happy with after the first match 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.819
 with players running straight on the sidelines freeing their backs so that 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.729
 you can now use the deadly passes better again 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.479
 Moreover, it is just on the higher levels of difficulty only 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.859
 more difficult to play off the defense as there are rooms and better and faster 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.289
 be delivered 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.879
 the appetite of scoring a tedious sisyphean job when it does 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.709
 but as far as the joy is the greater 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.639
 Of course, it can be the Kylie but on blunder the goalkeeper for example 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.499
 let balls bounce more often again Ground just jumps 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 so into the void 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.769
 the game pace probably compared to the previous year once again minimal 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.289
 can shut down in the settings but still no suitable 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.789
 There is clearly more to help than can be connected 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.029
 Among other things, a four-level adjustable passport support or a 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.159
 Assistant while climbing in the defense 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.730
 so PES 2012 can be exactly to their own abilities and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.310
 Customize experience what newcomers will be there for them 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.669
 much easier 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.759
 Also new is the hope of headless with the you can at 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:42.119
 Choose standard situations directly or control free kicks and into one 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.879
 brings better position 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.200
 Although in some situations this is definitely an advantage 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.220
 Usually you score on goal if you just play the ball in classic style 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.989
 do not trump 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.339
 in multiplayer profanation prohibited front and rear not 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.419
 interesting for professionals, at least the variant is two players independent 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.129
 from each other to taxes 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.689
 this results in significantly more in the forward movement 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.689
 Possibilities even if the cards and these interviewed 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.699
 otherwise it is due to the sensitive and control now 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.479
 It is even easier to defend the ball in tight spaces by putting on sprints 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.040
 to vary the pace or just the perfect one 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.439
 To save moment for the crucial pass 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.199
 Overall, PES 2012 feels crispier and more direct than a 2011 hit 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:24.830
 had 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.969
 Under the usual physics classes he often finds that 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:31.539
 in the frugal austerity situation puppet-sized scenario three hours 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.719
 Hall 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.899
 in terms of licenses, the series has now reached a decent level 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:44.120
 achieves important results like the French "l'Ã©quipe" 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.960
 or the Spanish Primera Division are completely licensed from others 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.800
 After all, groups from England are the most important teams 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.909
 Orginal Kickern and Regus on the court 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.809
 the Bundesliga is still missing only Bayern Munich and Bayer 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.990
 Leverkusen was able to secure Konami in the Champions League 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.090
 Konami also has the license for the European royal class in this 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.639
 Exclusive year again 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.129
 still not the full extent of not all teams and their stadiums 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.069
 represent 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.999
 kes 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.229
 As every year, Konami has been screwing on the details in the technology 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.199
 the enemas of the teams are now a bit pompous on the 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.710
 Stadiums themselves have not changed 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.669
 especially the ugly spectators first meanwhile more than that 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.449
 provide atmosphere 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.259
 for that, the faces have become much prettier 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.460
 just in the repetitions do the overworked things complete 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.020
 played sweat drops and clearly look at emotions a whole 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.240
 Amount ago 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.659
 something has also happened on the edge of the pitch 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.969
 Kamrath teams showed that happened on the court or the coaches announce 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.979
 the sideline instructions 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.509
 these are all nice details the place choice what their contribute and how the 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.569
 usual mail cart animation 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.830
 assist with a live broadcast 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.580
 the front, on the other hand, is at the previous year's level 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.280
 The fan-vocals sound pretty monotonous and listless, besides, you have one 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.620
 Commentator and Mohammed Ikbal footed already in the last 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.749
 Years ago it is a great pity that there is hardly any regret saying Selbitz 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.469
 Hagen 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.710
 it is 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.880
 Konami, he has a small backlog of the 2012 gamers 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.999
 FIFA series 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.869
 and one actually has the feeling that the developers are now the 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:25.830
 right thoughts 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.870
 PES 2012 is very catchy around the world and easy to follow 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.569
 many bad passes and problems 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.960
 the guide for advanced tactics foxes or joypad acrobats 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.710
 the innovations are noticeable especially in the much better spots 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.720
 while the victims would need euro to a limited extent rather for professionals 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.139
 is recommended 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.780
 the license package still needs some technical improvements 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.059
 Details like the onlookers or are still in negative government mobile 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.729
 the bottom line is pro Evolution Soccer 2012 but a successful one 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.830
 and very extensive football package 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.740
 thanks to the outstanding playability again a big one 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.830
 Step forward
