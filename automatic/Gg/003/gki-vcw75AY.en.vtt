00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
a lot of money too

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.080 
a lot of money too
by<00:01:47.780> two<00:01:48.049> items<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.680> kind<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.950> judge<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
by two items to kind of judge that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.840

outfit up and get ready to policy okay I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.450 
outfit up and get ready to policy okay I
think<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.780> big<00:01:54.140> thing<00:01:54.409> would<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> really<00:01:55.250> cool

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
think a big thing would be a really cool

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.550 
think a big thing would be a really cool
blazer<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.450> think<00:01:56.570> if<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.840> go<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.110> vintage

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
blazer so I think if you go to a vintage

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.620 
blazer so I think if you go to a vintage
shop<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.100> buy<00:01:58.220> kind<00:01:58.549> of<00:01:58.610> like<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> printed<00:01:59.299> or<00:01:59.600> a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
shop and buy kind of like a printed or a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.660 
shop and buy kind of like a printed or a
sequined<00:02:00.200> blazer<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:01.009> definitely<00:02:01.520> find
