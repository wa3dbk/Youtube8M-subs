there<00:03:49.769> most<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.310> commands<00:03:50.700> are<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.000> space

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
there most of the commands are in space

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.380 
there most of the commands are in space
you<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.170> need<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.350> go<00:03:52.560> see<00:03:53.180> what<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.269> does

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
