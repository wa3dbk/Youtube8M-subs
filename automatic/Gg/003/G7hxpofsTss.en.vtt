under the new loop that I just made grab

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.730 
under the new loop that I just made grab
the<00:02:16.620> yarn<00:02:16.800> again<00:02:17.450> bring<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.720> through<00:02:19.110> give

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the yarn again bring that through give

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.960 
the yarn again bring that through give
it<00:02:19.860> some<00:02:20.100> height<00:02:20.330> move<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.690> hand<00:02:22.080> up<00:02:22.380> again

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
it some height move my hand up again

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.010 
it some height move my hand up again
grab<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.420> strand<00:02:24.870> again<00:02:25.380> bring<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.100> through

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
grab the strand again bring that through

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.949 
grab the strand again bring that through
give<00:02:28.020> us<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.410> height<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.880> bring<00:02:30.810> my

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959

dropping this loop i'm pulling the new
loop<00:02:45.090> through<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.510> make<00:02:48.780> these<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.410> just

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
loop through you can make these in just

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.990 
loop through you can make these in just
minutes<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.870> mean<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.470> five<00:02:52.980> minutes<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.850> can

just feed this that end back into the
chains<00:07:17.389> just<00:07:18.389> like<00:07:18.870> this<00:07:20.539> and<00:07:21.539> if<00:07:21.660> you<00:07:21.780> want

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
chains just like this and if you want

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.779 
chains just like this and if you want
you<00:07:22.169> can<00:07:22.350> take<00:07:22.530> a<00:07:22.560> needle<00:07:22.830> and<00:07:23.010> thread<00:07:23.130> and<00:07:23.550> sew

you can take a needle and thread and sew

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.230 
you can take a needle and thread and sew
it<00:07:23.820> in<00:07:25.430> but<00:07:26.430> this<00:07:26.699> should<00:07:26.910> be<00:07:27.000> good<00:07:27.180> enough

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
it in but this should be good enough

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.629 
it in but this should be good enough
especially<00:07:27.750> if<00:07:28.139> you<00:07:28.229> get<00:07:28.410> it<00:07:28.560> into<00:07:28.770> wound<00:07:29.310> into

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
especially if you get it into wound into

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.339 
especially if you get it into wound into
the<00:07:29.970> netting<00:07:30.389> that's<00:07:30.630> in<00:07:30.810> there<00:07:31.020> so<00:07:31.289> that's

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:31.349 
the netting that's in there so that's

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:33.920 
the netting that's in there so that's
all<00:07:31.620> you<00:07:32.039> have<00:07:32.250> to<00:07:32.430> do<00:07:32.610> so<00:07:33.270> this<00:07:33.479> is<00:07:33.720> what<00:07:33.900> I

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930
