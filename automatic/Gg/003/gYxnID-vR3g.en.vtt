00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that at not 100 yards because we did

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.230 
that at not 100 yards because we did
that<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.390> another<00:00:27.660> video<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:29.340> 200<00:00:30.210> yards

now<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> winds<00:00:31.470> calm<00:00:31.650> down<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.040> bit

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
now the winds calm down a little bit

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400 
now the winds calm down a little bit
right<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> feeling<00:00:34.260> we're

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
right now and I have a feeling we're

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
right now and I have a feeling we're
going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.710> surprisingly<00:00:35.579> good<00:00:35.910> results

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
going to get surprisingly good results

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.930 
going to get surprisingly good results
so<00:00:36.750> we'll<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.050> targeting<00:00:37.640> two<00:00:38.640> different

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so we'll be targeting two different

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
so we'll be targeting two different
loads<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.420> two<00:00:39.660> separate<00:00:39.989> targets<00:00:40.430> 22<00:00:41.430> Magnum

okay<00:01:30.340> well<00:01:30.550> here<00:01:30.790> we<00:01:30.910> are<00:01:31.110> 200<00:01:32.110> yard<00:01:32.320> target<00:01:32.770> on

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
okay well here we are 200 yard target on

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.730 
okay well here we are 200 yard target on
the<00:01:33.010> top<00:01:33.040> we've<00:01:33.400> got<00:01:33.430> CCI<00:01:34.030> maxi<00:01:34.570> mag<00:01:34.750> 22<00:01:35.320> Magnum

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the top we've got CCI maxi mag 22 Magnum

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.580 
the top we've got CCI maxi mag 22 Magnum
on<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.950> bottom<00:01:36.310> at<00:01:36.640> federal<00:01:37.240> 22<00:01:38.080> Magnum<00:01:38.440> with

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
on the bottom at federal 22 Magnum with

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.310 
on the bottom at federal 22 Magnum with
a<00:01:38.620> 30<00:01:38.920> green<00:01:39.190> cierra<00:01:39.640> load<00:01:39.940> interestingly<00:01:40.870> at

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
a 30 green cierra load interestingly at

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.830 
a 30 green cierra load interestingly at
the<00:01:41.440> 100<00:01:41.980> yard<00:01:42.220> target<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.150> federal<00:01:43.600> did

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
the 100 yard target the federal did

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.160 
the 100 yard target the federal did
modestly<00:01:44.470> better<00:01:44.830> than<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.280> CCI<00:01:45.730> load<00:01:46.150> but<00:01:46.690> at

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
modestly better than the CCI load but at

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.710 
modestly better than the CCI load but at
200<00:01:47.800> yards<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:48.370> believe<00:01:48.910> we<00:01:49.090> have<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.300> winner

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
200 yards I believe we have a winner

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.400 
200 yards I believe we have a winner
here<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.440> CCI<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.210> probably<00:01:52.210> about<00:01:52.420> maybe<00:01:53.290> a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
here the CCI is probably about maybe a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.070 
here the CCI is probably about maybe a
half<00:01:53.470> an<00:01:53.800> inch<00:01:53.920> smaller<00:01:54.190> group<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.840> can

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
half an inch smaller group so you can

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.140 
half an inch smaller group so you can
see<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.350> differences<00:01:56.920> I'm<00:01:57.670> going<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.910> go<00:01:58.000> out

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
see the differences I'm going to go out

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.000 
see the differences I'm going to go out
on<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.360> limb<00:01:58.630> though<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.080> say<00:01:59.260> I<00:01:59.290> kind<00:01:59.950> of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
on a limb though and say I kind of

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.490 
on a limb though and say I kind of
pulled<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.460> shot<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.390> know<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.930> do<00:02:02.200> recall

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
pulled that shot you know I do recall

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.780 
pulled that shot you know I do recall
when<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:02.890> pulled<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.220> trigger<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.580> thought<00:02:03.760> oh

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
when I pulled the trigger I thought oh

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.260 
when I pulled the trigger I thought oh
I'm<00:02:04.000> not<00:02:04.150> happy<00:02:04.360> with<00:02:04.510> that<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:05.229> either<00:02:05.380> way

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
I'm not happy with that but either way

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.870 
I'm not happy with that but either way
200<00:02:07.270> yards<00:02:07.660> we've<00:02:07.840> got<00:02:08.080> sub<00:02:08.920> 3-inch<00:02:09.460> groups

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
200 yards we've got sub 3-inch groups

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.260 
200 yards we've got sub 3-inch groups
from<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:11.020> bolt<00:02:11.230> action<00:02:11.470> 22<00:02:11.800> magnum<00:02:12.640> rifle<00:02:12.820> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
from a bolt action 22 magnum rifle I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.510 
from a bolt action 22 magnum rifle I
think<00:02:14.050> that's<00:02:14.200> remarkable<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.950> mean<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> could

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
think that's remarkable I mean you could

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.220 
think that's remarkable I mean you could
actually<00:02:15.550> go<00:02:15.970> squirrel<00:02:16.300> hunting<00:02:16.390> at<00:02:16.750> 200

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
actually go squirrel hunting at 200

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.890 
actually go squirrel hunting at 200
yards<00:02:17.260> if<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:18.310> take<00:02:18.580> your<00:02:18.730> time<00:02:19.030> if<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.480> tuned

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
yards if you take your time if you tuned

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.440 
yards if you take your time if you tuned
the<00:02:20.170> rifle<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.800> ammunition<00:02:21.300> learn<00:02:22.300> to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the rifle to the ammunition learn to

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
the rifle to the ammunition learn to
control<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> trigger<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:24.010> think<00:02:24.250> you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
control the trigger and I think you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.500 
control the trigger and I think you
