00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 very good data and less a new video 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 and in this video we are going to say so 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.109
 summarize all the theories about the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.610
 last dlc or especially that what is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.320
 trying to make trels with these the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.730
 zombies are hiding many things and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.990
 true of many subjects that I love hold already 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.610
 You have seen it through some videos but 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.500
 I'm going to explain and thereafter 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.270
 is to put more ideas because I think that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 there is something else apart from the things 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.480
 they put for something is clear and therefore 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.250
 let's go so to say see all the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 theories and the relationships they have with 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.980
 the final stress is worth it and finally 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.779
 You see what my theories are 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.189
 applying the of course to things 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.660
 that we can lose the game we are going to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 start talking about what is strong and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 as many of uses you know it was discovered 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.610
 recently when the last ones have come out 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 of ecce a relationship has been discovered 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.420
 with the tlc of black ops 1 and with what 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 it goes with everything it was worth if we went to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.920
 catch the first letters of the packs 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.020
 of maps of black ops 1 is to say this one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 that haley are in English in reflection and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 we take the last names of trànsit 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.270
 there is race mobile the dead berit and the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 last one we do not know with the incognito 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 what is doing this video did not form 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.489
 a very interesting two words goes 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.719
 slow let's catch first strike first 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.059
 tlc de black ops 1 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.949
 efe after escalation of the black ops 1 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.140
 annihilation of the black ops 1 and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.519
 resurrection of the black ops 1 is worth this 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.480
 We are faithful that in English it means 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.790
 fear 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.470
 literally means to fear if we have 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 spoken the two of us can see transit that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.780
 just mind you reis just in the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.760
 test mode they just saw it that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 ends in and finally the last dlc 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.610
 that we do not know what it is and in this 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 they assume that everything will be resolved 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.890
 ends in and therefore we can see what 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.540
 form fear tm tt of whoever is of type 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.980
 as you know the stuffed animal the green that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 always goes with samantha that always 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.860
 we see with maps is very important 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.240
 for history we know because 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.740
 has always been in almost everyone else you go 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 to states and therefore they are telling us 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.270
 ted fear this makes sense but 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 catch it the first try that all this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.290
 you should have caught resurrection 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.790
 vengeance and all this from black ops 2 and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.170
 so it does not make much sense because 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.610
 you take the beginning of one and the end of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.870
 another has some sense because some 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.790
 They are pack of maps that include the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.620
 multiplayer and the other just zombie by 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.180
 which does not make much sense and to 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.680
 beginning I thought good I put myself 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.570
 reflection so you think resurrection 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 uprising could have formed 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.760
 perfectly a word the rucks of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 rss from rus man was better has something to 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.080
 see but with the next almost what is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.850
 vengeance form roof and ruth we do not know 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.040
 of any character or any 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.800
 association that we can do with rv by 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.540
 what we really do not know 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.400
 we already know clearly that it has to be 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.320
 with the stuffed animal and we already assumed that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.150
 so much coincidence was impossible so 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.010
 that if it's only the stuffed animal aside 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.300
 from that exposed this already knows this 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.250
 everyone left the forums has 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.170
 uploaded many videos is mainly 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.390
 in a part of my theory about how it goes 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 to be the end of lost or less everything 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.120
 clearly applied to what is the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.920
 video game taking things out of the game 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.960
 and let's go from two things we're going to 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.550
 starting from tight race the east map of what 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.560
 which is the tower that has been destroyed is 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.270
 partially destroyed and from that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.130
 let's go here not from the black totem 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.990
 ops 1 to mainly see two 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.730
 coincidences that we have seen today 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.290
 so much we can already associate the two maps 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.700
 mainly so it gets in the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 map of kino see totten and mainly 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.000
 I will also talk about when acs 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.350
 district the moon the easter 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.690
 say it as the white ends is one with 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.070
 what are the zombies the message 6 and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.810
 about everything important that is going to be 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.430
 with the pac ottón and from there you go 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.260
 put what in my theory in the race and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.670
 kim have totem we can hear the beast 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.770
 what the beast is supposed to be worth 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.450
 in both we can hear it and therefore it 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.550
 we know it's clearly had 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.200
 present this beast before the target 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.430
 everyone and therefore we know that it is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.080
 important to the story because it's going to 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.460
 mark a before and after for the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.900
 things that will make you hear it 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.560
 clearly how good is said 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.560
 listen to both 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.160
 therefore we see that in the lake there 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.810
 they wanted to bring this one as you see in one of 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 the first maps that came out and therefore 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.930
 they may want to explain the story 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.520
 in the black ops 1 and the best 9 of this 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.750
 time it occurred to him to do something else with 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.700
 in order to lengthen the history and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.500
 sell more health in general that I do not 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.640
 would surprise and decided to put the black 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.830
 ops 2 thing that can be perfectly 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.840
 for in order to solve what is worth 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.610
 this has been seen and heard many 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.380
 sometimes in taiz rises thing a lot ago 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.970
 Sometimes it's super heavy and good 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.620
 story does not stay and the most important thing 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.569
 of all and what ditch basically what 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.520
 that is the idea is world basically not 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.720
 things like a mojo happen many are the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.769
 there but basically you have to make a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.870
 mystery that which is to destroy the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.519
 land is worth and in this story is what 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.140
 basically it happens is that you before 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.850
 that you have to do that christopher 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.410
 take control of what is samantha the 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.090
 body that blanket is worth going so I can 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.380
 control the zombies and they are trans and 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.669
 we can see the zombies controlled by 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.950
 reid also because it has already happened 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.210
 that's worth then there's a pyramid and 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.190
 this pyramid is supposed to 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.360
 transport to other dimensions and things 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.919
 how are we and go into detail 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.270
 basically and one thing that happens in 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.950
 movement that you're trying to do the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.080
 listed and that when you are third or 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.060
 fourth there is a kind of tubes is a 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.310
 thing and with you are doing the last 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.479
 and samantha starts insulting you did you 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.080
 many things and especially starts to 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.879
 to insult 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.259
 and you take control of your body and what 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.639
 what happens is that he is saying things the 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.080
 rest did one thing I 'm going to 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.400
 put the first place should explain by 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.810
 next my english and you want her 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.350
 understand what's in it with subtitles but 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:55.140
 well here I leave it 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.140
 but he had to face 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.230
 this has two parts the first part 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.790
 is that the darkness will swallow all this 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.520
 You can basically refer to the 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.170
 the rest of the faith in which it may have been 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.910
 chosen goes to any other site 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.830
 something that I will expose in the videos 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.840
 of this series and mainly in the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.640
 second part that says is that there is something 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.860
 stronger than the something more terrible than 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.780
 the one that lies here is to say that it lies where 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.940
 is samantha where is the area happens 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.800
 something we do not know exactly how and where 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.300
 and what is really but what we know 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.710
 is that surely more the devil 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.120
 surely what we are hearing in 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.490
 the white is one and then touched that post 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.110
 before and this may take control of 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.120
 eristoff in bear above all you can 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.710
 something crazy the rest end and no longer be the 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.700
 bad of the movie but if the soul of 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.710
 the movie of the zombies is 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.780
 christopher and it may possibly be 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.610
 this one then I leave you there the reflection 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.380
 we already have five minutes that we have 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.030
 since this bear in mind that this will 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.350
 to come out in my next video you have the 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.730
 playlist in the description 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.470
 And you will have it always uploaded 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.580
 every Monday zombie videos I hope 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.990
 what did you like if you liked the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.460
 favorite team is always to say about 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.460
 all the next videos
