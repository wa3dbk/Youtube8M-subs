00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.480

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.080
 today the training collar for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.440
 rechargeable dogs is waterproof 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 so this model and waterproof the dog 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 can go in the water with but he does 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.830
 do not have to stay in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:27.359
 water a certain level of tightness that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:31.320
 is 3 out of 4 so this kit consists of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:37.170
 the remote there is a range of 300 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 meters so in free field of course of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:46.230
 the usb socket is suitable for plugging 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.160
 the charging cable that can also very 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.780
 be plugged into a USB socket 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:01.949
 you have the collar receiver the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:06.060
 adjustable nylon collar the small bulb 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.540
 of tests and short hair electrodes 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.540
 long hairs 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 so before the first use of this 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.790
 kit 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.510
 we recommend reloading 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.650
 necklace for six hours as well as the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.960
 remote control for six hours to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.940
 simply reload the necklace 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.850
 you have here two little holes with the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.179
 sealing caps the right hole 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.450
 you see we are a circle the taking of 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:53.039
 load of teeth until the end for 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.200
 well take the little click you can 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.990
 put it on usb or on the sector well 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.860
 sure and the remote control takes care of it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.590
 here so same principle on usb or on 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.670
 sector 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.670
 once these two devices loaded 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.579
 you will synchronize the collar with 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.930
 the remote control 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:25.410
 so we turn on the remote control here in 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.390
 pressing the mode button that's it and we 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.720
 will synchronize the collar so it's up to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.370
 done at the first time and each time 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.560
 that one of the two batteries will be 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.830
 completely unloaded so there it is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 desynchronizes rats 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.420
 and playing as synchronized where you 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 go see it's pretty simple so we 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.680
 press using a spike so I 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.490
 take a pen with a tip is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.970
 press here on the little button you hear 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.770
 the pipe 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.980
 and right away we pressed twice 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.270
 on the y button of the remote control the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.540

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:07.330
 parcel is ready you hand over the small 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.330
 very important sealing seals 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.990
 so a little bit difficult to put 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.990
 sometimes 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.110
 hop 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.410
 so here they are put then to 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.990
