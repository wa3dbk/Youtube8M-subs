00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
actually done it for a couple of months
I<00:00:18.270> don't<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> time<00:00:19.410> at<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> moment<00:00:19.859> if

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
I don't have the time at the moment if

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.620

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
first off is pretty much buying items

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
first off is pretty much buying items
for<00:00:54.989> cheap<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.620> selling<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.160> more

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
for cheap and then selling them for more

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
for cheap and then selling them for more
that's<00:00:56.969> as<00:00:57.090> basic<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that's as basic as it's going to get and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
that's as basic as it's going to get and
that's<00:00:58.859> pretty<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.670> obviously

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that's pretty much what it is obviously

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
that's pretty much what it is obviously
there's<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:01.050> depth<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.770> obviously

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
there's more in depth to obviously

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
there's more in depth to obviously
watching<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:03.300> much<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> margins<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.140> stuff

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
watching how much the margins are stuff

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
watching how much the margins are stuff
like<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> general<00:01:05.700> idea

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
like that but that is the general idea

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
like that but that is the general idea
of<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.140> reason<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.619> these

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
of this so the reason that these

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
of this so the reason that these
following<00:01:08.159> items<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.790> increasing<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.330> price

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
following items are increasing in price

obviously<00:04:10.440> prices<00:04:11.430> could<00:04:11.610> begin<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.030> fall<00:04:12.180> at

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270

game at least once every day or every
couple<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.590> days<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> make<00:04:20.310> sure<00:04:20.340> you

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
couple of days just to make sure you
