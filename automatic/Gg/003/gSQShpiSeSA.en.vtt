one<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> key<00:00:32.369> inspirations<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
one of the key inspirations for them is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.959 
one of the key inspirations for them is
the<00:00:34.200> waveform<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.520> see<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.850> in

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the waveform and you can see that in

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.900 
the waveform and you can see that in
