 place on the rope 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.720
 a very important detail the speed 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.679
 that I'm going to hit has to be the same 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.300
 teacher speed eg

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.880
 first class 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.799
 it makes no sense for the student to hit harder 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.380
 that the teacher 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.380
