00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.390
 there is something more important 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.419
 family money 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.180
 Enjoy some of these aspects to the fullest 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.669
 It depends completely on your health status 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.849
 people have to live 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.079
 fifth where the science of welfare is taking us 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.740
 in recent years science has discovered that welfare will grow 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.800
 to be the greatest breakthrough of our time 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.539
 the system of natural renewal of the body 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.650
 your own stem cells aim 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.890
 let's take into account something important 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.570
 We are not talking about medical procedures that generally involve 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 embryonic stem cells 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 We are talking about stem cells that are found naturally in the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.910
 bone marrow 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.100
 From the moment we are born, fines are known as stem cells 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.590
 and that is correct 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.710
 even children have adult stem cells 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.340
 in recent years the investigations have discovered the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.839
 natural way and that adult stem cells 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.949
 have the ability to become virtually any cell in the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.130
 body 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.440
 this is your body height positioning system 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.720
 the innate power of your adult stem cells 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840
 whenever a fabric grants is not needed 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.000
 A complete process of renewal take place in the body for Angel Barja 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.070
 maintain optimal health 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.439
 that tissue sends specific messages that travel through the blood 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.110
 towards the bone marrow 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.010
 when the message was 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.170
 induces cell division 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.270
 in this process every time a stem cell is released into the bloodstream 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.170
 an armed cell remain in the bone marrow maintaining a population 

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:44.430
 constant stem cells in the bone marrow 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.470
 gradually the number of stem cells increases in the blood 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.170
 shortly after 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.890
 the damaged tissue on different days messages that do not attract those cells 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.840
 mother 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.900
 when they circulate in the affected tissue and find that these messages 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.640
 they stop in the bloodstream immigrants out of the blood 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.670
 once in the tissue the stem cells travel where they are needed 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.399
 once there 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.930
 the stem cells begin to multiply 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.409
 in order to exemplify the renovation process to finally 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.779
 become functional cells of that tissue 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.969
 each mother cell has the potential to become a few thousand 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.189
 cells of a specific tissue 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.119
 6 through this natural process of renewal 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.199
 that your body maintains a healthy opinion every day of your life 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.980
 i the scientific community 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.520
 this time recognizing that a large number of stem cells circulating 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.549
 they are associated with better health 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.549
 after two decades of research cti experience 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.739
 occurs naturally with an aquatic plant called eagerness and its less 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:51.979
 2 aquarium 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.030
 known as before singing the renowned scientist worldwide 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.009
 cristian mole 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.809
 hundreds development 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.419
 hundreds is an explosive and patented concentrate so explains 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.859
 which grows naturally in a dark environment of the northwest 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.189
 peaceful 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.349
 the lord while 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.889
 found that after one hour of consumption 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.900
 hundreds not only helps the natural release of stem cells 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.199
 ips of the bone marrow 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:22.579
 It also supports the migration of these stem cells to the tasks that 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.389
 they need 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 that's why it contributes to the natural mechanism of body renewal 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.680
 an independent scientific team confirmed this work of this entity 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.429
 using a simultaneous study with controlled placebo 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:40.089
 this study was published in a bulletin called medicine of the 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.529
 cardiovascular vascularization in September 2007 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.370
 the study showed 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.110
 the anz stent supported the release of sudan from adult stem cells in a 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.249
 average of 25% 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.389
 this equates the next big interest of three to four million cells 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.369
 mother in circulation 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.410
 stephen t was founded by cristian rag 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.920
 and the president and my character was added 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.920
 with the purpose of distributing the first product of its patented type in the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.489
 welfare industry 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.059
 hundreds has created a category of its own within the industry of the 500 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:17.419
 million dollars of health and welfare 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.209
 the first stem cell promoter this is creating noise 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.449
 because this institution that you can feel 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.870
 let's talk about what is the first meaning for you 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.830
 what you want to say to you, you are in the right place at the right time 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.689
 I assist the interested 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.930
 you are making money with the frenzy of stem cells 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.930
 they are good questions but why 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.620
 but we are a global company with a presence above all countries and 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.759
 adding more continuously 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.039
 you are already part of 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.430
 I think it will take until last night from small to large 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.670
 and being there in this market and with this product 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.670
 not only create an income so you can create 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.570
 industry experts know what separates most people from 6 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:08.629
 5% 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:09.999
 that generates more income 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.849
 are the effective systems 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.949
 systems that allow you to communicate quickly and effectively the message that 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.629
 they accompany that they are the product and the opportunity to thousands of people 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.070
 by wealth builders our tool on the internet and in the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.870
 following advantages 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.960
 you do not have to be an expert in stem cells 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.159
 the presentations are made for you 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.599
 just like this 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.349
 you have access to the most advanced training and marketing technology 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.050
 cash on the internet 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.389
 and that's just the spearhead 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.320
 no other internet marketing tool comes even close 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.870
 the best that is in your favor
