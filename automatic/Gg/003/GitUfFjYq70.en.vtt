not that I was actually pretty
impressive<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.390> think<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.690> cuz<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.869> didn't

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
impressive I think it's cuz I didn't

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
impressive I think it's cuz I didn't
figure<00:00:19.199> him<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.650> good<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.279> he<00:00:20.400> was

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

goalkeeper<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.199> 5<00:01:04.650> 11<00:01:05.129> 6<00:01:05.369> foot<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
goalkeeper I think it's 5 11 6 foot so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
goalkeeper I think it's 5 11 6 foot so
it's<00:01:06.060> quite<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> small<00:01:06.420> keeper<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.409> still<00:01:07.710> he

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it's quite a small keeper but still he

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.000 
it's quite a small keeper but still he
did<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:09.210> decent<00:01:09.930> system<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.380> he<00:01:10.710> was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
did get to some decent system as he was

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.490 
did get to some decent system as he was
easily<00:01:11.369> logged<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.420> he<00:01:12.540> did<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
easily logged but he did get down as you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
easily logged but he did get down as you
can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.799> gets<00:01:14.040> him<00:01:14.159> two<00:01:14.280> columns<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> stuff

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
can see gets him two columns and stuff

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
can see gets him two columns and stuff
like<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> he<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> saves<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
like that and he does make the saves and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
like that and he does make the saves and
from<00:01:16.799> corners<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> didn't<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> bring<00:01:18.180> him

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
from corners I didn't want to bring him

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.609 
from corners I didn't want to bring him
out<00:01:18.420> too<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:18.780> knowing<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.380> quite<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
out too much knowing that is quite a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.679 
out too much knowing that is quite a
small<00:01:19.770> keeper<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.000> did<00:01:21.180> he<00:01:21.450> made

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
small keeper but when he did he made

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
small keeper but when he did he made
sure<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:21.990> could<00:01:22.140> hit<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> ball<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> saw<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
sure he could hit the ball you saw that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
sure he could hit the ball you saw that
a<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.640> strong<00:01:23.850> punch<00:01:24.150> making<00:01:24.600> sure<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
a good strong punch making sure the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
a good strong punch making sure the
balls<00:01:25.110> could<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.950> absolutely<00:01:26.130> awesome

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
balls could which is absolutely awesome

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
balls could which is absolutely awesome
but<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.540> thing<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.810> did<00:01:27.960> notice<00:01:27.990> all

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
but this is one thing I did notice all

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
but this is one thing I did notice all
of<00:01:28.409> him<00:01:28.619> he<00:01:29.100> made<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> saves<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.150> his

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
of him he made a lot of saves with his

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
of him he made a lot of saves with his
feet<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.720> his<00:01:30.869> lower<00:01:31.049> body<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.409> stuff<00:01:31.650> like

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
feet with his lower body and stuff like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
feet with his lower body and stuff like
that<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.520> quite<00:01:32.909> frustrating<00:01:33.509> because

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that which was quite frustrating because

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.850 
that which was quite frustrating because
I<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.290> thought<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.470> should<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.799> be

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
I really thought I should just be

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
I really thought I should just be
catching<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.340> stuff<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
catching with stuff like that but as you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
catching with stuff like that but as you
can<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.990> doesn't<00:01:37.500> hold<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> ball<00:01:38.040> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
can see doesn't hold on to the ball but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
can see doesn't hold on to the ball but
make<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.540> there<00:01:39.720> an

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
make sure that it's not there an

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.149 
make sure that it's not there an
opposition<00:01:40.200> player<00:01:40.409> which<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> something

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
opposition player which is something

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
opposition player which is something
that<00:01:41.280> caught<00:01:41.549> why<00:01:41.759> didn't<00:01:42.119> he<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> few

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that caught why didn't he did have a few

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
that caught why didn't he did have a few
silly<00:01:43.799> decisions<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.939> most
