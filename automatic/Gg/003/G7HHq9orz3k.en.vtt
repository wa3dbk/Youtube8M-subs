00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 good afternoon dear friends today wanted 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.589
 would tell you about such an important moment 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.170
 like the eruption of our seedlings here 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.540
 frost and sun exposure 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.309
 landing that is not all the seedlings we have in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 individual pots when we 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.520
 sometimes we transplant roots 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.140
 get damaged and she pulls in the sun what 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.750
 don't go on said 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.730
 There is an engraftment that I use here 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.040
 such straw baskets are woven they 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.350
 very positive stress 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 seedlings are precisely influenced by the sun and 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 frost that is, they are here as a safeguard 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.559
 Folsa fever such here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.120
 temperature drop ie stable 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.000
 now look there under these 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.399
 straw baskets here look 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.460
 what beautiful peppers i noticed him in the morning 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.129
 there you see years of sunshine 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 bright enough and now look like in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.210
 what a good condition our seedlings here 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 for some reason one brick did not stick but 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 already very bad look at the rest 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.260
 all the normal leaves are not at last 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.280
 nothing here look without without this to 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.369
 always pepper at all 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.650
 we divide because pepper yes here such 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.229
 well taken 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.830
 I have about 40 of them just alternating 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.680
 when planting seedlings and there is a vase 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.540
 frost i mean youth me here 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.430
 entering overseas is sure to cover 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.190
 too, because of her in Beijing 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.020
 the cabbage on the next row is good she 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.380
 not bad 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.460
 from more or less well, good look here 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.170
 here before already doing it completely 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.840
 even on the second day she is very bad 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.409
 takes root that is, they can 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.479
 use and to save that's the sun 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.539
 and from frost look like this 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.700
 sat again the cabbage between the potatoes 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.020
 the meat is covered 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.319
 these baskets and how how well 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.080
 takes root 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.980
 that is, on her first day not 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.140
 act no sun is cold to her on 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.420
 takes root well on good 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.610
