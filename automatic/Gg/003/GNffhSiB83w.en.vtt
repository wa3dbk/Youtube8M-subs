00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it's on a different level it's because

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's on a different level it's because
the<00:02:11.160> colors<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.790> display<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.720> weird

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
looking I still cannot explain what I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.480 
looking I still cannot explain what I

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.910 
see when I viewed this display you can
say<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> colors<00:02:18.300> look<00:02:18.570> cartoonish<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.620> don't

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
say the colors look cartoonish I don't

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.560 
say the colors look cartoonish I don't
know<00:02:20.040> how<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.550> explain<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.210> but<00:02:21.420> it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
know how to really explain it but it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.570 
know how to really explain it but it
definitely<00:02:21.750> does<00:02:22.380> not<00:02:22.560> look<00:02:22.830> natural

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
definitely does not look natural

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.910 
definitely does not look natural
it<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:24.150> very<00:02:24.360> responsive<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.230> touch<00:02:25.470> but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it is very responsive to the touch but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.010 
it is very responsive to the touch but
for<00:02:26.130> some<00:02:26.310> reason<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.910> color<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.360> not<00:02:27.840> up

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
for some reason the color is just not up

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.410 
for some reason the color is just not up
