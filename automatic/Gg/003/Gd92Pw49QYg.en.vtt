00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
light this is the equivalent of 301

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.290 
light this is the equivalent of 301
pounds<00:06:06.500> so<00:06:06.949> it's<00:06:07.130> 300<00:06:07.760> in<00:06:07.880> one<00:06:08.060> of<00:06:08.090> those

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
pounds so it's 300 in one of those

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.070 
pounds so it's 300 in one of those
little<00:06:08.510> blue<00:06:09.139> pebbles<00:06:09.970> again<00:06:10.970> and<00:06:11.270> this<00:06:11.870> is
