automatic<00:04:12.330> movement<00:04:13.640> very<00:04:14.640> accurate

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
automatic movement very accurate

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.680 
automatic movement very accurate
actually<00:04:15.919> against<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.010> atomic<00:04:17.340> cart<00:04:17.690> this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
actually against the atomic cart this

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.170 
actually against the atomic cart this
one<00:04:19.019> believe<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.680> or<00:04:19.769> not<00:04:19.919> maybe<00:04:20.700> losing<00:04:21.000> about

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
one believe it or not maybe losing about

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.159 
one believe it or not maybe losing about
four<00:04:21.600> seconds<00:04:22.109> three<00:04:22.919> seconds<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.580> month<00:04:24.169> so

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
four seconds three seconds a month so

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.510 
four seconds three seconds a month so
I'm<00:04:25.950> very<00:04:26.130> pleased<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:26.639> that

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
I'm very pleased with that

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
I'm very pleased with that
but<00:04:29.520> whether<00:04:29.729> would<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.240> buy<00:04:30.510> another<00:04:30.560> horas

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
but whether would I buy another horas

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.250 
but whether would I buy another horas
for<00:04:31.740> diving<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.370> don't<00:04:32.970> think<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.389> not<00:04:34.020> very

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
for diving I don't think so not very

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.250 
for diving I don't think so not very
reliable<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.450> surface<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:37.110> know

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
reliable on the on the surface you know

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.719 
reliable on the on the surface you know
you<00:04:37.410> always<00:04:37.560> think<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> lose<00:04:38.490> it

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
you always think is it going to lose it

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.159 
you always think is it going to lose it
I<00:04:38.940> don't<00:04:39.479> know<00:04:39.540> if<00:04:39.600> if<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.810> do<00:04:39.930> with<00:04:40.110> the

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
I don't know if if to do with the

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.820 
I don't know if if to do with the
titanium<00:04:40.530> case<00:04:41.040> or<00:04:41.930> or<00:04:42.930> what<00:04:43.350> because<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.770> know

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
titanium case or or what because I know

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.190 
titanium case or or what because I know
someone's<00:04:44.760> got<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> steel<00:04:45.210> version<00:04:45.660> it's<00:04:46.020> much

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
someone's got a steel version it's much

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.890 
someone's got a steel version it's much
better<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.710> wrist<00:04:47.120> for<00:04:48.120> presence<00:04:48.630> on<00:04:48.780> the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
better on the wrist for presence on the

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.159 
better on the wrist for presence on the
wrist<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.800> can't<00:04:50.490> fault<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.940> looks<00:04:51.930> fantastic

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
wrist you can't fault it looks fantastic

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.150 
wrist you can't fault it looks fantastic
so<00:04:52.860> if<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.280> want<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.490> dress<00:04:53.729> what<00:04:54.889> but<00:04:55.889> don't

so if you want to dress what but don't
want<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.370> go<00:04:56.460> diving<00:04:56.960> definitely<00:04:57.960> buy<00:04:58.080> this

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
want to go diving definitely buy this

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.010 
want to go diving definitely buy this
and<00:04:59.340> 4/7<00:04:59.789> well<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.030> think<00:05:00.330> it's<00:05:00.450> about<00:05:00.630> eleven

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
and 4/7 well I think it's about eleven

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.990 
and 4/7 well I think it's about eleven
hundred<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.380> fifteen<00:05:01.680> pounds<00:05:02.430> at<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.550> moment

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
hundred and fifteen pounds at the moment

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.180 
hundred and fifteen pounds at the moment
so<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:04.139> that's<00:05:04.320> for<00:05:04.440> an<00:05:04.530> automatic<00:05:04.860> movement

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
so and that's for an automatic movement

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.240 
so and that's for an automatic movement
Omiya<00:05:05.580> do<00:05:06.080> an<00:05:07.080> automatic<00:05:07.500> movement<00:05:07.770> for<00:05:08.100> about

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
Omiya do an automatic movement for about

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.790 
Omiya do an automatic movement for about
two<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.669> half<00:05:08.700> thousand<00:05:09.360> pounds<00:05:09.800> so

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
two and a half thousand pounds so

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.540 
two and a half thousand pounds so
considerably<00:05:11.700> cheaper<00:05:15.919> but<00:05:16.919> like<00:05:17.039> I<00:05:17.070> said<00:05:17.220> if

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
considerably cheaper but like I said if

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.040 
considerably cheaper but like I said if
you<00:05:17.700> just<00:05:17.729> want<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.060> dress<00:05:18.210> water<00:05:18.510> or<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.750> sports

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
you just want to dress water or a sports

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.820 
you just want to dress water or a sports
watch<00:05:19.460> definitely<00:05:20.460> buy<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.639> if<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.030> don't
