00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 mister head and welcome to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.220
 my speed of pokémon platinum 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.299
 I do not have a german later on 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.649
 found youtube and thought so 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.599
 now I'm doing it by myself just a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.150
 to show you how short the game is 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.410
 if you do not do everything I can 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.210
 have this game synonymous normal 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 plan to do the lures you can 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.109
 in the description look but that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 is not the point now 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.350
 So I have this one plays before 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.359
 not tested i got one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 strategy, but I have it 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.119
 so far not tried and we 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 so look forward to it as the whole 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.250
 My goal is the game 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 by playing under five hours and I 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
 consider that quite realistic 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.370
 all cases are more realistic than at 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.010
 pokémon black and white 1 where it is not 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 I also made live stream 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.530
 davis strangely, I can do it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.300
 do not know what they did differently 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 I do not care 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 In any case, my strategy consists 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.260
 in that I can attack flame on 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
 I'll play with sword dance and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 probably melee and flames 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.120
 advise as I said not before now 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 it can be that I'm doing something 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.079
 change and or just not 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.989
 works and for the third arena 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 I get extra red with red 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 I should be in a position with the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.580
 nimble claw and thunder wave to the opponent 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.950
 to live so that we have nothing to do 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.759
 can and then I will come back 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.140
 paper or yes and bands slows things down 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.560
 that is me for this challenge 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 exceptionally times reset 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.439
 Be a reason for yourself 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 acceptable spam flame but I have 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.729
 not done in the other challenges 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.110
 In the case of the being I do not care hastily or 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.430
 naive are ok and I accept 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.470
 he should not be on any initiative 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.680
 be up and I'll take care of that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.329
 pay attention that pan flames 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.320
 when I have brought it to level 6 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.100
 After the first fight I have to go 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.630
 of course, winning on 15 will increase to 15 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 they are probably perfect 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.750
 genes or in any case very very good 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 genes and I'll need good 4 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.049
 is voltage cinema as usual I will 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.750
 the text as far as possible 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.579
 skip and I strongly recommend 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.979
 that they run at a speed on the ds 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.469
 used the tabs touchpen and not 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.629
 the normal keys or say so 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.950
 that he uses the keys less than 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.360
 the touch pen of the touchpen has here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.050
 really priority is extreme 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 important 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.620
 it is always with sg touchpen 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.090
 always faster 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.950
 if not much else I will 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.540
 always played as a young man 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.100
 because this time the woman because 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.690
 I have to say quite honestly I think 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.290
 the female character is around 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.450
 a little nicer I take it now as 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 players just took lucy 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.160
 of course a fairytale ajar 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.870
 moment my favorite spare anime and 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.090
 I would say we start directly 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.600
 yes, that's the word superfluous of the word 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.020
 commitment again it is me imagining 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.790
 on the right as the rival is he has with 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.410
 to do the challenge relatively little 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.580
 if you already own the game 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.870
 so surprise if you say yourself 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.280
 have ever inspired to do so 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.540
 the only not on youtube then have 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.740
 can you say how long times it 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.770
 have used what strategies 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.060
 because if I have this 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.470
 Upload video is the most complete 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.630
 team already recorded 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.790
 I really want to do it this time 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.360
 long to keep closed until I 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.940
 I'm done because spoiler otherwise I like 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.870
 time and not something or me 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.130
 then say any things I do 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.070
 will not do it later 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 not really one right now 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.910
 Countermeasure is however no matter as 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.750
 first thing you always when speedphone as 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.940
 first thing that's actually that one 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.850
 the options set extender to three 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.070
 innovations from movements occupancy 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.450
 then you can and a nice one 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.880
 frame because it's supposed to be a bit too 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.050
 make fun and then it comes 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.459
 the rival is high and wants to camp us 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.930
 Well, it is sometimes faster 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.489
 if you ask at certain points or 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.560
 Depressed as if you were up all the time 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.680
 the keys hammering when you exactly 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.880
 moment vdb presses where the text is currently 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.890
 Finished writing it is a bit 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.780
 faster than when you push around wildly 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.070
 I do not know why that's me 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.180
 I found that out 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.459
 no idea though and made by 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.690
 it can have light loading times 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.250
 be quite that he is with the two 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.769
 play cope faster than with 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.840
 platinum platinum for a stronger trainer 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.980
 there and then even more content I 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.290
 I can well imagine that someone 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.390
 perl in a hospital better to handle 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.560
 are or are easier to handle than 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.060
 platinum 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.930
 Of course it's a bit hard too 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.190
 but say well 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.690
 this first video will be very very short 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.130
 because I really only really 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.710
 explain how this is and in itself 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.479
 works and flames before panning 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.039
 already save and follow 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.069
 finish because as I said on one 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.020
 hoping that is flawed 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.710
 just a need that works 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.720
 not otherwise 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.819
 Well, what does it mean is ok 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.930
 different but if it's really good 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.910
 then you need to work 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.990
 a reasonable start at mine 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.460
 I do not have other speed runs like that 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.840
 pay attention to it in the first one 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.060
 Generation is not like that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.440
 important which starter you have 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.960
 or how good the genes are 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.370
 or maybe because of being and should he 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.650
 there are no beings 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.880
 but there are those very well and 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.199
 could really go along with him 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.060
 play a big role you can 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.300
 trust me 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.740
 well I think it does not take at all 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.310
 more so until we get the starter 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.099
 get 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.800
 works that is relatively fast now yes 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.740
 I'm pretty slow right now 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.479
 Now I come with a professor 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.069
 Lucius and then there will be a bit 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.610
 then talk to our starter 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.729
 is beautiful 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.729
 because of whom I am on 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.699
 Most people really worry us 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.159
 third order and maybe a bit 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.630
 the fifth one depends on it 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.070
 I think the fifth will not work 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.199
 as bad as the third is the third 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.180
 just a problem because it is ghost pokémon 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.070
 that is the one thing and then it is 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.400
 because of this trauma that they radiate 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.680
 can 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.759
 since we can not so much make the 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.530
 I thought I'll just get me 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.060
 red endure but that is only possible 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.830
 this could not be the case in platinum 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.570
 make and then I just use and 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.020
 nimble claw for the first blow 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.539
 get 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.860
 the nimble gives you 30% first 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.539
 I've read shock in the cup wiki 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.349
 So very very good I have 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.849
 of course always made the same mistake 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.009
 as a negative example 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.599
 You always have to ask for the year 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.130
 press if her appearance is that 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.680
 pokémon basically bad with that 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.820
 dialog repeated and you have the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.039
 listen to all the shit again 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.930
 that was not very smart of 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.090
 I tell it that way 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.349
 the problem with pokémon platinum or 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.669
 generally play the fourth 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.139
 Generation is sometimes very 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.460
 Save long and then get up 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.020
 once you save a lot of data 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.490
 I know no way to avoid that 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.720
 And that's all I said 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.669
 But what does one want to do? 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.620
 Well that was it with this one 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.590
 first consequence because now we have to now 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.699
 choose a starter and soon 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.020
 which ones probably just five 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.479
 minutes to cover then comes here 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.800
 reasonably back 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.940
 Well, I hope I could interest 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.340
 Awakening you will find in the description 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.300
 once uploaded is the second part 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.009
 and as I said the other boards 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.960
 projects that I recorded or 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.009
 any other pokémon projects can 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.650
 Maybe on my channel sound 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.509
 I'm not interested in anything 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.970
 well possible next job ever
