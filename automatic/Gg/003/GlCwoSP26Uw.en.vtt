maps are divided by a deep chasm you're

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.389 
maps are divided by a deep chasm you're
always<00:01:04.449> kind<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.839> fighting<00:01:05.259> for<00:01:05.290> control<00:01:05.829> over

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
always kind of fighting for control over

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.920 
always kind of fighting for control over
that<00:01:06.520> crossover<00:01:07.030> from<00:01:07.299> one<00:01:07.450> side<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> map

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
that crossover from one side of the map

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.480 
that crossover from one side of the map
to<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.200> other<00:01:08.350> my<00:01:08.710> tip<00:01:08.890> for<00:01:08.920> discovery<00:01:09.430> is

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
to the other my tip for discovery is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.530 
to the other my tip for discovery is
really<00:01:09.670> just<00:01:09.790> learning<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.149> layout<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.479> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
really just learning the layout of the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.270 
really just learning the layout of the
map<00:01:10.719> understanding<00:01:11.469> how<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.710> chasm<00:01:12.100> can

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
map understanding how that chasm can

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.010 
map understanding how that chasm can
impact<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:13.000> flow<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> game<00:01:13.390> play<00:01:13.750> and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
impact the flow of the game play and

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.719 
impact the flow of the game play and
always<00:01:14.500> being<00:01:14.649> conscious<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> exposure

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
always being conscious of the exposure

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.550 
always being conscious of the exposure
that<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.030> have<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.450> long-range<00:01:16.810> weapons<00:01:17.350> you

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
that you have to long-range weapons you

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.620 
that you have to long-range weapons you
might<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.889> on<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.039> snow<00:01:18.579> bridge<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.299> somebody

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
might be on a snow bridge and somebody

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.510 
might be on a snow bridge and somebody
throws<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.929> grenade<00:01:20.079> which<00:01:20.709> collapses<00:01:21.399> the
