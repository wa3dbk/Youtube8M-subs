ups and downs for me I think that you
know<00:01:39.210> Ryan<00:01:39.570> would<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.590> good<00:01:41.310> thing<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
know Ryan would be a good thing but you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
know Ryan would be a good thing but you
have<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.180> brother<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.689> who<00:01:42.840> isn't

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
have your brother back who isn't

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.370 
have your brother back who isn't
Forrester<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> who<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.759> heir<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.390> Lord

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
Forrester and who is the heir to Lord

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.210 
Forrester and who is the heir to Lord
Forrester<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.490> case<00:01:48.110> Roger<00:01:49.110> dies<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.770> mean<00:01:49.979> if

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
Forrester in case Roger dies I mean if

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.780 
Forrester in case Roger dies I mean if
Roger<00:01:50.460> gets<00:01:50.820> killed<00:01:51.149> who<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.399> there<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
Roger gets killed who will be there to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.880 
Roger gets killed who will be there to
take<00:01:54.030> leadership<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.869> iron<00:01:55.140> wrap<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.710> would

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
take leadership of iron wrap you would

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.120 
take leadership of iron wrap you would
have<00:01:56.070> Griff<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.560> still<00:01:58.979> have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
have Griff there so if we still have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.600 
have Griff there so if we still have
Ryan<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.790> secure<00:02:00.350> iron<00:02:01.350> wrath<00:02:01.770> basically<00:02:02.430> he's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
Ryan to secure iron wrath basically he's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
Ryan to secure iron wrath basically he's
a<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:02.969> young<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> know<00:02:03.750> still

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
a bit too young but you know still

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.249 
a bit too young but you know still
actually<00:02:04.920> makes<00:02:05.280> sense<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.110> ahead

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
actually makes sense but if we go ahead

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.490

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
for me that could be a bad thing because

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.199 
for me that could be a bad thing because
we'll<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.650> High<00:02:39.650> Point<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.220> they<00:02:41.060> know

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.880 
that we're trying to take Ryan therefore
they<00:02:43.069> will<00:02:43.100> try<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:44.360> more<00:02:44.569> secure<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.290> keep

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
running secure therefore they can't take

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.160 
running secure therefore they can't take
Ryan<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.920> can't<00:02:49.130> take<00:02:49.190> Ryan<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.850> actually<00:02:50.840> kind

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
know keeping Griff in control instead of

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.840 
know keeping Griff in control instead of
securing<00:03:18.170> Ryan<00:03:18.530> good<00:03:19.430> at<00:03:19.549> what<00:03:19.700> they're

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
securing Ryan good at what they're

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.300 
securing Ryan good at what they're
really<00:03:20.060> after<00:03:20.360> right<00:03:21.079> now<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.799> maybe<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.130> might

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
really after right now so maybe we might

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.270 
really after right now so maybe we might
go<00:03:22.519> ahead<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.120> get<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.959> try<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.709> take<00:03:24.980> Ryan

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
go ahead and get to try to take Ryan

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.640 
go ahead and get to try to take Ryan
away<00:03:25.610> from<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.329> white<00:03:26.600> heels<00:03:26.870> at<00:03:27.110> some<00:03:27.380> point

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
away from the white heels at some point

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.039 
away from the white heels at some point
in<00:03:27.769> Episode<00:03:28.190> four<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:28.670> five<00:03:28.940> right<00:03:29.780> now<00:03:29.810> it

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
in Episode four or five right now it

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.500 
in Episode four or five right now it
seems<00:03:30.980> highly<00:03:31.400> unlikely<00:03:31.549> because<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.329> don't

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
seems highly unlikely because we don't

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.699 
seems highly unlikely because we don't
have<00:03:32.570> these<00:03:32.780> four<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:33.200> take<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.530> white

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
have these four to take on the white

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.280 
have these four to take on the white
heels<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.549> Ryan<00:03:35.209> out<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:36.019> safely

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
heels and get Ryan out of there safely

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.890 
heels and get Ryan out of there safely
it's<00:03:36.769> kind<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.100> really<00:03:37.280> risky<00:03:37.670> move<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.480> try

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
it's kind of a really risky move to try

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.660 
it's kind of a really risky move to try
to<00:03:38.959> take<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.440> white<00:03:39.620> heels<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.190> rescue

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
to take on the white heels and rescue

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.550 
to take on the white heels and rescue
Ryan<00:03:41.269> now<00:03:41.630> there<00:03:41.840> could<00:03:41.930> be<00:03:41.989> some<00:03:42.320> kind<00:03:42.440> of

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
Ryan now there could be some kind of

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.430 
Ryan now there could be some kind of
deal<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:43.100> could<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:43.940> place<00:03:44.209> taxi<00:03:44.870> you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
deal that could be in place taxi you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.580 
deal that could be in place taxi you
know<00:03:45.620> get<00:03:46.459> Ryan<00:03:46.760> back<00:03:47.060> maybe<00:03:47.450> because<00:03:48.079> I<00:03:48.290> don't

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
know get Ryan back maybe because I don't

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.640 
know get Ryan back maybe because I don't
see<00:03:48.799> how<00:03:49.130> taking<00:03:49.609> Ryan<00:03:49.910> could<00:03:50.660> benefit<00:03:51.200> Lord

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
see how taking Ryan could benefit Lord

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.310 
see how taking Ryan could benefit Lord

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
could actually use them as a bargaining

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.810 
could actually use them as a bargaining

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
without that army it just seems like

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.870 
without that army it just seems like
they<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.320> two<00:04:35.560> little<00:04:35.740> forces<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.790> they

they have two little forces and they
were<00:04:37.000> actually<00:04:37.120> fail<00:04:37.660> against<00:04:38.200> trying<00:04:38.530> to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.340 
take Ryan back or something like that so
but<00:04:42.340> Roger<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.880> also<00:04:43.300> aware<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.750> he<00:04:44.110> might

but Roger is also aware that he might
not<00:04:44.530> have<00:04:44.590> no<00:04:45.130> choice<00:04:45.430> but<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.690> know

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
not have no choice but to you know

attack<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.590> white<00:04:47.770> Hill<00:04:47.950> so<00:04:48.250> it's<00:04:48.760> better<00:04:48.970> to

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
attack the white Hill so it's better to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.580 
attack the white Hill so it's better to
actually<00:04:49.240> be<00:04:49.540> prepared<00:04:49.990> for<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.290> small

actually be prepared for that small

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.800 
actually be prepared for that small
battle<00:04:51.040> instead<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.730> not<00:04:51.940> being<00:04:52.150> prepared<00:04:52.330> and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
battle instead of not being prepared and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.470 
battle instead of not being prepared and
trying<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.350> wait<00:04:53.560> on<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:54.370> sales<00:04:54.700> or<00:04:54.910> army<00:04:55.270> or

trying to wait on the sales or army or

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.930 
trying to wait on the sales or army or
Gareth<00:04:56.080> or<00:04:56.230> anybody<00:04:56.650> else<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.730> might

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
Gareth or anybody else so it might

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.330 
Gareth or anybody else so it might
actually<00:04:58.320> benefit<00:04:59.320> them<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.770> actually<00:04:59.950> make<00:05:00.310> a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
actually benefit them to actually make a

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.630 
actually benefit them to actually make a
plan<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:01.480> attack<00:05:01.810> instead<00:05:02.530> of<00:05:02.710> not<00:05:03.070> preparing

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
plan to attack instead of not preparing

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
Point will act will definitely involve

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.490 
Point will act will definitely involve
Ryan<00:05:09.130> in<00:05:09.490> some<00:05:09.790> way<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.870> is<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.169> deal

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
Ryan in some way but it is a deal

Ryan in some way but it is a deal
whether<00:05:12.370> it's<00:05:12.550> humiliation<00:05:13.270> or<00:05:13.480> something

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
whether it's humiliation or something
