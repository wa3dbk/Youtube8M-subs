00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
going to look underneath

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
going to look underneath
and<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:16.540> appears<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.899> be<00:01:16.990> any<00:01:17.200> kind<00:01:17.439> of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and there appears to be any kind of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.220 
and there appears to be any kind of
issue<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.450> here

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.960 

as<00:01:27.560> far<00:01:27.800> as<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.490> drain<00:01:28.730> looks

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
as far as I see the drain looks

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.930 
as far as I see the drain looks
completely<00:01:29.390> clear<00:01:30.080> back<00:01:30.350> here<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.890> don't<00:01:31.760> think

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
completely clear back here I don't think

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.480 
completely clear back here I don't think
that<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.210> our<00:01:32.360> problem<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.160> we're<00:01:34.160> going<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.340> go

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
that is our problem so we're going to go

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.720 
that is our problem so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:37.660> pull<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.750> unit<00:01:38.900> out<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.920> I

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
ahead and pull the unit out and I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.520 
ahead and pull the unit out and I
checked<00:01:41.030> about<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.510> just<00:01:41.990> remove<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.380> back

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
checked about that just remove the back

00:01:42.530 --> 00:02:34.990 
checked about that just remove the back
panel<00:01:42.770> here<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.310> can<00:01:43.460> see<00:01:43.610> inside

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.270 

all<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.120> once<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:37.019> take<00:02:37.170> take<00:02:37.829> this<00:02:37.950> apart

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
all right once we take take this apart

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.890 
all right once we take take this apart
here<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.819> can<00:02:38.969> see<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.329> there's<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.599> frost

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
here we can see that there's a frost

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
here we can see that there's a frost
drain<00:02:40.349> pan<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.400> cracked<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:44.099> every<00:02:44.879> time<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
drain pan it's cracked so every time it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.420 
drain pan it's cracked so every time it
goes<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.450> self<00:02:45.689> defrost<00:02:46.049> water<00:02:46.439> seeps

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
goes in the self defrost water seeps

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.319 
goes in the self defrost water seeps
through<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.760> pan<00:02:48.829> onto<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.950> base<00:02:50.489> which

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
through the pan onto the base which

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.940 
through the pan onto the base which
isn't<00:02:51.540> sealed<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.439> it<00:02:52.560> gets<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.859> an

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
isn't sealed and then it gets to an

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.670 
isn't sealed and then it gets to an
opening<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.639> goes<00:02:53.760> onto<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> floor<00:02:54.359> so

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
opening and just goes onto the floor so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.720 
opening and just goes onto the floor so
it's<00:02:55.680> probably<00:02:55.980> been<00:02:56.099> doing<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.579> some

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
it's probably been doing that for some

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.580 
it's probably been doing that for some
time<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:58.079> what<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.680> is<00:03:00.409> look<00:03:01.409> up
