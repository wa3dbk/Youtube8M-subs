00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 So now has a victory some signals 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.540
 Of these, 20 meters regulate some of them 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.950
 detected and now I have mine 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.270
 dug up interesting why we like that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.010
 I would have to find many of them 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.960
 just keep looking if I have something there 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
 interesting finds something one thing 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 could make a connection yes 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.760
 interesting in any case worthwhile 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.760
 take a closer look 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.800
 so after a tracks only scrap signal 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.239
 infected and iron yes in this soccer because 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.770
 but what she is doing for me again 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.160
 coin from the third empire of the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 I would almost say I had to say color 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 clean up 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 As always , that's what I am 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.309
 Unfortunately, unfortunately pretty broken as stop 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.659
 Unfortunately, these old tin zinc coins are 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.659
 but at least no cartridge 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 Sir 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:20.970
 so next dog a seal unfortunately not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.950
 a lot more to see but powerful 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.950
 but also a damn good signal 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 next of nothing special what to stay 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.480
 I changed the field because 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 but there are no more stubble here 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.240
 Unfortunately, this is not how I am here 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.020
 some things went 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.860
 Do it now completely and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.450
 will then switch again 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.310
 Maybe I have these more 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.310
 good luck until later 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:24.410
 next and here in this totally west 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:33.980
 also not always baked like that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:36.400
 you can still recognize baked knowledge 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.400
 it 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.750
 because they always clean with 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.750
 the field 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:15.910
 so wonderful nice clear signal remains 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.489
 nice stable 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.940
 I would go out and have something 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.940
 it is 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.590
 this looks like a holy pendant 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 first out 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.120
 it is not as interesting that is 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.090
 maybe not a holy pendant 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.359
 that also looks great on it and it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.500
 are two with hdr attachments so 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:53.420
 above and below so rather no trailer 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:56.750
 back maybe there's something on it 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.090
 I think cool on request if one 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.879
 curious what's on it for me like 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.349
 in the coat of arms I really want to 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.239
 I'm only here for a few minutes 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.389
 I'll pack one already because like 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.069
 you see , that's easy to run 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.439
 bad still that you have to wait until 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.879
 is now dug up by the the 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.539
 areas where the home is a bit shorter 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.739
 are as somewhere else and so super me 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.979
 I think I'll have a few more , too 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.050
 minutes because it already starts 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.190
 really good 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.760
 Sir 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.290
 so new ak huge vehicles thunder 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.460
 In the background i think i think so 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.110
 two moment when the not yet 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.110
 endangered to get in the back 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:47.950
 sens are 85 as I said frequency 78 as 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:55.360
 a strength 2 reaction two experts 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:57.400
 I do not need peter 014 until 15 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.170
 sens I can still slightly higher 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.300
 make and set the ground off the same 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.720
 I only do that when I'm a few meters 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.270
 ran 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.120
 Two pay over the measured value 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.900
 then i have a hamas 0-run and if 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:23.160
 I want to go to the daycare I go with it 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.160
 the frequency then click on the 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.920
 4.1 this is massive mode which is for 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.450
 forest very good when i go to the farm and 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.450
 I also like to walk 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.630
 So I'm on my way back 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.610
 Home has to eat slowly what was there was 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.229
 A tough fight today for a coin 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.910
 I found but I have 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.949
 have not given up yet 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.639
 still found nothing special 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.770
 but at least 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.190
 I always clean and then look 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.580
 we have the time to have a good time 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.780
 began 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.530
 that means i will probably spend some time in 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.810
 next week in the fields 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.330
