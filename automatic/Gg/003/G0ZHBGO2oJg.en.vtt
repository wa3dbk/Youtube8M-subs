00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Hello, my name is Susi and today we are going to show you 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.980
 an unforgettable way to present 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.180
 a fresh fruit salad for a baby shower 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.080
 with stroller theme. 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.040
 This is what we are going to need: 

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:18.132
 Gather your materials and the moment arrived 

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:20.193
 to build a stroller. 

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.169
 Take the watermelon and cut a thin slice 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.190
 at the bottom to keep it 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.910
 Stable on the plate or serving tray. 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.705
 Wraps an elastic band 

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:33.127
 around the length of the watermelon. 

00:00:33.127 --> 00:00:35.527
 Then it involves a second round 

00:00:35.527 --> 00:00:38.784
 in the width of the watermelon, a little outside the center. 

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:42.245
 Starting at the intersection of the two rubber bands 

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:46.005
 We are going to make horizontal cuts around the watermelon. 

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.044
 Use the knife. 

00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:50.520
 Follow the rubber band and do the same 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.059
 along the vertical rubber band. 

00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:59.247
 Remove the large piece on top 

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:02.267
 and then take out the watermelon 

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:04.839
 to fill the stroller later. 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.497
 If you have enough watermelon balls, 

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:09.694
 You can clean the rest of the cavity 

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.534
 with a large spoon. 

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:14.234
 Now that we have the body of the stroller 

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:16.473
 we must add the wheels. 

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:18.549
 Take an orange and a lemon 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.890
 and cut them into four slices of orange 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 and four slices of lemon. 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.329
 Stack a slice of orange and a slice of lemon 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.990
 on top of each other 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.290
 and drill with a toothpick. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 Now repeat this until you have four wheels. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.250
 Place the wheels for transporting the watermelon 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.144
 and decorate each wheel with a raspberry. 

00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:50.742
 Next, take the melon, 

00:01:50.742 --> 00:01:53.000
 peel the skin and cut in half 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.020
 to use it as the face of the baby. 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.440
 Cut a grape in two for the eyes of the baby 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.700
 and a little watermelon to make the nose. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.318
 Insert the chopsticks in the middle of the melon 

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:08.277
 where you want to place your nose and eyes. 

00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:11.818
 Place the grape halves and a little watermelon 

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:15.158
 in toothpicks and we have the face of a baby. 

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:18.197
 To make the baby's mouth, cut a small triangle 

00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:20.037
 under the nose. 

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:23.612
 This must be the mouth and there you will fix the pacifier. 

00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:27.573
 Fill the watermelon cart with the rest of the fruit 

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:32.492
 and then place the head of the baby melon inside. 

00:02:32.492 --> 00:02:35.192
 We are going to present the watermelon stroller in a tray 

00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:37.652
 surrounded by fruit at the bottom. 

00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:39.713
 Is not this a unique way to present 

00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:41.673
 a traditional fruit salad? 

00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:43.933
 Your guests will be talking about this 

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:45.913
 until the bit of joy arrives. 

00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:48.053
