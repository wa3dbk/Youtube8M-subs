00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.020
 Hi, I'm an ethics consultant company 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.059
 v style image and today we are going to give you 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.790
 some tips and recommendations on 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:16.029
 to wear to a wedding day it 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.279
 first thing we have to know is if the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.160
 wedding is going to make religious or is going to do 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.079
 civilian we have to know more or less the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.960
 where it's going to happen because it's not 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.450
 the same as a wedding in a field or 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.970
 a wedding on a beach or even a wedding 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.290
 in a hotel and then finally the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.579
 label that the horse has to carry 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.920
 the gentleman to adapt our 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.350
 dress the most common and most 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.080
 It would be advisable to resort to a dress 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.570
 cocktail that would by just above 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.750
 the knee we can also take some 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.490
 dress just below the knee 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.650
 but you always have to avoid everything 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.930
 be many glitters all that is 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.060
 a lot of stone whatever feathers say 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.380
 all this kind of fabrics much more 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.410
 sophisticated we would have to leave them 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.450
 for weddings more than more than one night 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.980
 alternative also to the classic dress 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.229
 that lately is very fashionable 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.380
 would resort to what can be a 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 jumpsuit is to say a monkey 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.930
 or a type with a blouse pants palazzo 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.939
 this type of garments although they are 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.700
 pants we can put them on because 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.960
 visually it seems that we carry a 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 long skirt then they would be 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.659
 formally allowed shoes 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.909
 always better from a medium heel or a 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.510
 high heel but always according to our 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.550
 to our clothes 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.400
 bags are always recommended that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.950
 be tiny to be able to take them in 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.080
 the best hand that does not carry many 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.080
 stone inlays and do not be 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.700
 too bright as 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.350
 complements we can resort to what 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.180
 it would be a hat that would be a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.770
 outside complement that this what 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 means is that then once we 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.430
 we have removed the coat we have 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.890
 to remove the hat too and we have 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.750
 also what would be the headdresses or 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.660
 turbans that are now very fashionable and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.520
 that this type of complement serves us 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.250
 very good for this type of events 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.750
 because it gives us one more touch to our 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.490
 outfit for example if we wear a look 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.070
 a little simpler gives us that point 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.590
 that we need other than that it is very 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.870
 fashionable, it is not necessary for us to take off 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.910
 this is touched during all the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 ceremony regarding colors would be 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.470
 allowed all kinds of colors except 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.120
 whites and blacks in terms of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.190
 whites we could also put the range 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.500
 that would be like broken white oil 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.070
 eggshell we would also leave 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.380
 on one side and finally remember that it is 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.120
 better not to wear sunglasses that we 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.950
 we remove so much in the church 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.129
