find that shading is really important in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.660 
find that shading is really important in
today's<00:02:24.290> cartoons<00:02:25.290> everybody<00:02:25.920> does<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.990 
to the drawing so you'll see me do a lot
of<00:02:37.800> shading

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800 

that's<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.520> screens<00:02:48.880> on<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.330> desk<00:02:49.600> on

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
that's one of the screens on the desk on

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.780 
that's one of the screens on the desk on
the<00:02:49.840> control<00:02:50.290> desk<00:02:55.260> another<00:02:56.260> screen<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:57.040> don't

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790

know<00:02:57.910> what<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> does<00:03:00.480> I'll<00:03:01.480> ever<00:03:02.730> some<00:03:03.730> buttons

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
know what it does I'll ever some buttons

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120 
know what it does I'll ever some buttons
a<00:03:04.950> lot<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.130> buttons<00:03:07.380> I'm<00:03:08.380> going<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.709> get<00:03:08.860> crazy

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
a lot of buttons I'm going to get crazy

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.090 
a lot of buttons I'm going to get crazy
with<00:03:09.580> colors<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.959> moment<00:03:12.390> there<00:03:13.390> we<00:03:13.540> go<00:03:14.100> look

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
with colors in a moment there we go look

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.500 
with colors in a moment there we go look
at<00:03:15.220> that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.949 

right<00:03:21.200> now<00:03:21.530> I'm<00:03:21.769> writing<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.689> part<00:03:23.689> of<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
right now I'm writing the part of the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.660 
right now I'm writing the part of the
joke<00:03:24.849> okay<00:03:25.849> those<00:03:26.090> two<00:03:26.329> guys<00:03:27.610> they<00:03:28.610> were

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
joke okay those two guys they were

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.509 
joke okay those two guys they were
pretty<00:03:29.239> easy<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.780> draw<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.970> went<00:03:32.209> fast<00:03:33.519> yeah

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
pretty easy to draw it went fast yeah

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.360 
pretty easy to draw it went fast yeah
it's<00:03:35.360> always<00:03:35.599> faster<00:03:36.200> when<00:03:36.409> you<00:03:36.560> when<00:03:37.159> you've

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
it's always faster when you when you've

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.399 
it's always faster when you when you've
got<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.610> sketch<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.420> work<00:03:38.629> with<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:40.790> couldn't

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
got a sketch to work with I I couldn't

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.830 
got a sketch to work with I I couldn't
toon<00:03:42.409> boom<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:42.829> not<00:03:43.069> well<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.000> didn't<00:03:44.420> find<00:03:44.629> any

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
toon boom is not well I didn't find any

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.830 
toon boom is not well I didn't find any
way<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.140> use<00:03:46.129> toon<00:03:46.579> boom<00:03:46.790> for<00:03:47.269> sketching

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
way to use toon boom for sketching

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.039 
way to use toon boom for sketching
easily<00:03:48.769> maybe<00:03:49.579> someone<00:03:50.239> can<00:03:50.450> tell<00:03:50.659> me<00:03:50.720> how<00:03:50.959> to

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
easily maybe someone can tell me how to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.530 
easily maybe someone can tell me how to
do<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.620> don't<00:03:51.799> know<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.670> always<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.390> to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
do it I don't know so I always have to

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.539 
do it I don't know so I always have to
use<00:03:53.569> my<00:03:53.840> pen<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.200> paper<00:03:54.319> beforehand<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.459> then

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
use my pen and paper beforehand and then

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.629 
use my pen and paper beforehand and then
it's<00:03:55.970> much<00:03:56.269> easier<00:03:56.950> now<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.159> is<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.370> vector

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
it's much easier now this is a vector

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.800 
it's much easier now this is a vector
based<00:03:59.290> software<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.730> not<00:04:02.329> great<00:04:02.569> for

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
based software so not great for

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.580 
based software so not great for
sketching<00:04:03.379> but<00:04:03.620> amazing<00:04:04.340> for<00:04:06.310> Ford<00:04:08.230> when<00:04:09.230> when

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
sketching but amazing for Ford when when

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.649 
sketching but amazing for Ford when when
you've<00:04:09.769> got<00:04:09.920> your<00:04:09.980> sketch<00:04:10.430> all<00:04:10.639> done<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.269> you

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
you've got your sketch all done and you

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.729 
you've got your sketch all done and you
just<00:04:11.900> need<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:12.230> trace<00:04:12.560> over<00:04:13.010> what<00:04:13.250> you've<00:04:13.400> done

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
just need to trace over what you've done

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.259 
just need to trace over what you've done
say<00:04:15.739> I'm<00:04:15.889> doing<00:04:16.250> some<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:16.639> shading<00:04:17.030> under

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
say I'm doing some more shading under

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.060 
say I'm doing some more shading under
the<00:04:17.419> desk<00:04:17.630> here<00:04:18.970> trying<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.030> get<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.329> right

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
the desk here trying to get it right

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.570 
the desk here trying to get it right
those<00:04:22.070> are<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.490> big<00:04:23.060> screens<00:04:23.600> in<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:25.220> control

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
those are the big screens in the control
