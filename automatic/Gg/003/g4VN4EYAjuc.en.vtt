essentially<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:08.300> you're<00:01:08.450> trying<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.780> do<00:01:08.950> is

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
essentially what you're trying to do is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.920 
essentially what you're trying to do is
your<00:01:10.190> name<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.940> game<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.330> collect<00:01:11.570> four

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.690 
your name of the game is to collect four
bowls<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:12.920> why<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.130> defined<00:01:13.520> as<00:01:13.670> a

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
bowls and this is why is defined as a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.490

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.170 

I<00:01:22.000> guess<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:23.210> my<00:01:23.330> turn<00:01:23.360> again

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
points by placing the files

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.360 
points by placing the files
