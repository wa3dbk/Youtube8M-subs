00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.210 
the first first couple crisis have a lot
of<00:01:06.330> enthusiasm<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.320> think<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:07.890> great

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
of enthusiasm but I think we got great

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
of enthusiasm but I think we got great
weather<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.700> guys<00:01:08.880> Rachel's<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.690> there

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
weather the guys Rachel's get out there

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
weather the guys Rachel's get out there
and<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:10.230> there<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.340> good<00:01:11.460> retention

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and and there was pretty good retention

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.240 
and and there was pretty good retention
from<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.480> we<00:01:12.660> ended<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> season<00:01:13.950> with

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
from what we ended up the season with

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
from what we ended up the season with
from<00:01:14.550> from<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> returning<00:01:15.300> player<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
from from the returning player so I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
from from the returning player so I
thought<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.470> good<00:01:16.530> day<00:01:16.790> can<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
thought was a pretty good day can you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
thought was a pretty good day can you
computer<00:01:18.210> lecture<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.690> for<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> freshness

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
computer lecture this for the freshness

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.000 
computer lecture this for the freshness
uh<00:01:19.800> well<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.690> from<00:01:21.900> obviously<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
uh well just just from obviously from a

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.740 
uh well just just from obviously from a
familiarity<00:01:23.430> standpoint<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.270> night<00:01:24.479> day<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
familiarity standpoint it's night day I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
familiarity standpoint it's night day I
mean<00:01:25.050> I<00:01:25.170> remember<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> first<00:01:25.770> practice<00:01:26.280> last

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
mean I remember the first practice last

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
mean I remember the first practice last
year<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.940> got<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.260> halfway

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
year we got when we got the halfway

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
year we got when we got the halfway
through<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> popsicles<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:29.940> all<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
through with the popsicles and all that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
through with the popsicles and all that
they<00:01:30.360> couldn't<00:01:30.630> even<00:01:30.690> walk<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> popsicle

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
they couldn't even walk to the popsicle

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
they couldn't even walk to the popsicle
so<00:01:31.920> today<00:01:32.220> they<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.700> mean<00:01:33.330> we're<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.660> in<00:01:33.810> shape

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
so today they I mean we're not in shape

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
so today they I mean we're not in shape
right<00:01:34.290> now<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.010> mean<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.310> understand<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
right now but I mean they understand the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
right now but I mean they understand the
routine<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.690> there<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.800> know<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> lot

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
routine and there was a you know a lot

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
routine and there was a you know a lot
less<00:01:38.369> stress<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.060> effort<00:01:39.210> than<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.050> at

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
less stress and effort than there was at

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
less stress and effort than there was at
this<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> year<00:01:40.860> ago<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.759> major

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this time of year ago what is major

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.120 
this time of year ago what is major
things<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.690> watch<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.229> day<00:01:43.410> what<00:01:44.040> do

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
things that you watch and day what do

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.090 
things that you watch and day what do
you<00:01:44.190> really<00:01:44.600> first<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.890> more

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you really first well it's really more

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.640 
you really first well it's really more
you<00:01:47.400> know<00:01:47.460> obviously<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:49.020> coaches<00:01:49.530> don't

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
you know obviously some coaches don't

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.160 
you know obviously some coaches don't
think<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.070> effort<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.660> it<00:01:51.780> should<00:01:52.020> be

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
think you effort you know it should be

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
think you effort you know it should be
assumed<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.800> think<00:01:53.250> you're<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.460> were

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
assumed but I think you're all were

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.859 
assumed but I think you're all were
always<00:01:53.910> coaching<00:01:54.179> effort<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.720> then

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
always coaching effort and then

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.930 
always coaching effort and then
certainly<00:01:55.619> fundamentalism<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> guys<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
certainly fundamentalism I guys going to

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.090 
certainly fundamentalism I guys going to
make<00:01:57.060> mental<00:01:57.330> mistakes<00:01:57.690> but<00:01:57.929> we're<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
make mental mistakes but we're really so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.650 
make mental mistakes but we're really so
simple<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.640> spring<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.119> shouldn't<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
simple in the spring we shouldn't have a

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.600 
simple in the spring we shouldn't have a
lot<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.929> mental<00:02:01.289> mistakes<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.460> it's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
lot of mental mistakes but for me it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
lot of mental mistakes but for me it's
more<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.660> fundamentally<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.530> they

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
more you know fundamentally are they

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.290 
more you know fundamentally are they
doing<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> right<00:02:05.160> things<00:02:05.429> fundamentally<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
doing the right things fundamentally and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.850 
doing the right things fundamentally and
then<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.960> effort<00:02:07.289> why's<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.500> they

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
then you know effort why's that they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.500 
then you know effort why's that they
doing<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.369> every<00:02:08.610> staff

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
doing it on every staff

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.150 
doing it on every staff
it's<00:02:11.510> pretty<00:02:11.720> good<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.960> mean<00:02:12.290> compared<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.950> your

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it's pretty good I mean compared to your

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.350 
it's pretty good I mean compared to your
ghost<00:02:13.400> Knight<00:02:13.610> day<00:02:13.850> just<00:02:14.120> because<00:02:14.180> they

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
ghost Knight day just because they

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.540 
ghost Knight day just because they
understand<00:02:14.810> how<00:02:14.990> we<00:02:15.050> do<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.650> our<00:02:16.070> practice

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
understand how we do it and our practice

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.010 
understand how we do it and our practice
on<00:02:16.700> me<00:02:16.880> y'all<00:02:17.270> were<00:02:17.330> out<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.750> mean<00:02:17.810> it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
on me y'all were out here I mean it's

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.960 
on me y'all were out here I mean it's
not<00:02:18.140> long<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.040> usually<00:02:19.220> pretty<00:02:19.490> intense

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
not long but it's usually pretty intense

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.360 
not long but it's usually pretty intense
and<00:02:20.240> we<00:02:20.750> try<00:02:20.990> we<00:02:21.260> think<00:02:21.530> we<00:02:21.620> can<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:21.950> more<00:02:22.310> done

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
and we try we think we can get more done

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.670 
and we try we think we can get more done
in<00:02:22.760> an<00:02:23.060> hour<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.660> 15<00:02:24.020> minutes<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> lot<00:02:24.650> of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
in an hour and 15 minutes and a lot of

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.680 
in an hour and 15 minutes and a lot of
teams<00:02:24.890> doing<00:02:25.100> two<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> half<00:02:25.640> hour<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.150> we

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
teams doing two and a half hour so we

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.570 
teams doing two and a half hour so we
move<00:02:26.900> pretty<00:02:27.140> quickly<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.890> does<00:02:28.070> gassin

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
move pretty quickly but it does gassin

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.340 
move pretty quickly but it does gassin
and<00:02:28.730> our<00:02:28.850> guys<00:02:29.000> we're<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.480> they're<00:02:30.050> not<00:02:30.080> going

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
and our guys we're not they're not going

to be in game shape until August so well

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.270 
to be in game shape until August so well
you<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> take<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.220> consideration

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
you know I take that in consideration

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.880 
you know I take that in consideration
but<00:02:35.120> when<00:02:35.330> they're<00:02:35.450> out<00:02:35.600> there<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.650> know<00:02:36.710> we

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
but when they're out there you know we

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.830 
but when they're out there you know we

expect the full speed effort for the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.750 
expect the full speed effort for the
most<00:02:39.050> part<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.320> think<00:02:39.380> we<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:40.550> know

think he probably grows up on it anytime
