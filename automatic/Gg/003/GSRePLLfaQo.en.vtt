very addicting strategic gameplay I'd
have<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.280> say<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.880> probably<00:04:51.090> one<00:04:51.300> of

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
have to say that this is probably one of

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.970 
have to say that this is probably one of
the<00:04:51.570> most<00:04:51.840> addicting<00:04:52.410> games<00:04:52.620> I<00:04:52.770> have<00:04:52.950> ever

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
the most addicting games I have ever

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.920 
the most addicting games I have ever
played<00:04:53.220> but<00:04:53.880> that's<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.150> problem<00:04:54.390> because<00:04:54.810> you

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
played but that's a problem because you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.630 
played but that's a problem because you
only<00:04:55.110> have<00:04:55.350> 30<00:04:55.500> game<00:04:55.830> days<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.190> complete<00:04:56.520> the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640

game<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.420> said<00:04:57.480> one<00:04:58.020> game<00:04:58.260> day<00:04:58.440> is

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
game and like I said one game day is

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.290 
game and like I said one game day is
about<00:04:58.770> 15<00:04:59.190> minutes<00:04:59.520> so<00:04:59.820> you're<00:04:59.970> looking<00:05:00.060> at

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
about 15 minutes so you're looking at

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.820 
about 15 minutes so you're looking at
about<00:05:00.360> seven<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> half<00:05:01.050> hours<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.530> gameplay

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
about seven and a half hours of gameplay

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.590 
about seven and a half hours of gameplay
which<00:05:02.280> was<00:05:02.490> disappointing<00:05:02.760> because<00:05:03.240> it's

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
which was disappointing because it's

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.120 
which was disappointing because it's
such<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.750> great<00:05:03.930> game<00:05:04.230> I<00:05:04.440> would<00:05:04.710> definitely
