that's a very big deal having an

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.170 
that's a very big deal having an
entirely<00:04:07.350> new<00:04:07.530> storyline<00:04:08.070> completely<00:04:08.970> kind

duty zombies after it ended with origins
literally<00:04:13.890> an<00:04:14.130> entirely<00:04:14.580> new<00:04:14.790> storyline<00:04:15.360> it's

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
literally an entirely new storyline it's

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.780 
literally an entirely new storyline it's
not<00:04:15.810> even<00:04:16.049> somewhat<00:04:16.350> related<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:17.310> samantha

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
not even somewhat related to samantha

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.280 
not even somewhat related to samantha
maybe<00:04:18.030> they<00:04:18.239> will<00:04:18.359> relate<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.780> back<00:04:18.810> cuz<00:04:19.140> of

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
maybe they will relate it back cuz of

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.930 
maybe they will relate it back cuz of
the<00:04:19.380> element<00:04:19.680> 115<00:04:19.980> but<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.790> was<00:04:20.910> very

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
the element 115 but it was very

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.969 
the element 115 but it was very
interesting<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.660> see<00:04:21.840> how<00:04:22.080> they<00:04:22.350> related<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
interesting to see how they related it

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.070 
interesting to see how they related it
now<00:04:23.430> whether<00:04:23.729> or<00:04:23.910> not<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.180> origins<00:04:24.630> ending

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
now whether or not the origins ending

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.840 
now whether or not the origins ending
would<00:04:25.740> be<00:04:25.950> essentially

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
would be essentially

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.270 
would be essentially
the<00:04:26.970> end<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.630> zombies<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.650> where<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.040> took

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
the end of zombies like where this took

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.520 
the end of zombies like where this took
place<00:04:29.340> or<00:04:29.880> like<00:04:30.060> kind<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.450> prequel<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.080> they

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
place or like kind of a prequel and they

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.440 
place or like kind of a prequel and they
somehow<00:04:31.770> guessed<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.580> have<00:04:32.910> no<00:04:33.120> idea<00:04:33.270> how

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
somehow guessed it I have no idea how

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.060 
somehow guessed it I have no idea how
they're<00:04:33.720> going<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.870> go<00:04:34.020> about<00:04:34.200> explaining<00:04:34.380> the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
they're going to go about explaining the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.610 
they're going to go about explaining the
origins<00:04:35.460> ending<00:04:35.790> in<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.090> but<00:04:36.810> uh<00:04:36.840> we'll<00:04:37.590> see

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
origins ending in this but uh we'll see

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.860 
origins ending in this but uh we'll see
whether<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.430> an<00:04:38.760> entirely<00:04:39.090> new<00:04:39.270> scrappin

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
whether that is an entirely new scrappin

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.360 
whether that is an entirely new scrappin
just<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.110> element<00:04:40.380> 115<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.100> only<00:04:41.220> thing

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
just the element 115 is the only thing

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.920 
just the element 115 is the only thing
that<00:04:41.490> carries<00:04:41.790> over<00:04:41.940> because<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> could<00:04:42.780> make

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
that carries over because it could make

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.660 
that carries over because it could make
sense<00:04:43.200> for<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.410> company<00:04:43.710> being<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.250> thing<00:04:44.490> as

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.150 
the new intelligent AI we're kind of the
line<00:06:15.750> between<00:06:15.930> zombies<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:16.710> humans<00:06:17.010> is<00:06:17.130> very

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
line between zombies and humans is very

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160 
line between zombies and humans is very
blurred<00:06:17.580> so<00:06:18.150> how<00:06:18.300> they<00:06:18.480> pull<00:06:18.750> that<00:06:18.900> off<00:06:18.930> I'm

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
blurred so how they pull that off I'm

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.200 
blurred so how they pull that off I'm
not<00:06:19.290> exactly<00:06:19.590> sure<00:06:19.770> because<00:06:20.640> you<00:06:20.760> could<00:06:20.910> still

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
not exactly sure because you could still

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.150 
not exactly sure because you could still
loop<00:06:21.540> but<00:06:22.170> whether<00:06:22.350> the<00:06:22.530> zombies<00:06:22.860> would<00:06:23.010> have

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
loop but whether the zombies would have

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.860 
loop but whether the zombies would have
guns<00:06:23.520> are<00:06:23.940> like<00:06:24.120> what<00:06:24.360> would<00:06:24.480> the<00:06:24.600> zombies

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
guns are like what would the zombies

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.260 
guns are like what would the zombies
exactly<00:06:25.320> do<00:06:25.650> to<00:06:26.190> kind<00:06:26.310> of<00:06:26.400> have<00:06:26.640> a<00:06:26.670> brand<00:06:27.090> new

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
exactly do to kind of have a brand new

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.570 
exactly do to kind of have a brand new
hyper<00:06:27.510> AI<00:06:27.840> would<00:06:28.590> that<00:06:28.740> be<00:06:28.860> simply<00:06:29.220> just<00:06:29.400> not

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
hyper AI would that be simply just not

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.370 
hyper AI would that be simply just not
rolling<00:06:30.000> around<00:06:30.120> on<00:06:30.390> the<00:06:30.450> ground<00:06:30.540> I'm

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
rolling around on the ground I'm

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.320 
rolling around on the ground I'm
interested<00:06:31.860> to<00:06:31.890> see<00:06:31.980> how<00:06:32.160> that<00:06:32.340> goes<00:06:32.370> all<00:06:33.120> in
