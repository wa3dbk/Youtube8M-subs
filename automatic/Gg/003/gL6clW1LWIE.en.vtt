00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
was this one of those names that you can

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.490 
was this one of those names that you can
chalk<00:00:05.759> up<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.120> just<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.540> couldn't<00:00:06.839> shoot<00:00:07.020> or

chalk up to just you couldn't shoot or
was<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.649> more<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.069> than<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.809> thought

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
was it more to it than that I thought

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.330 
was it more to it than that I thought
they<00:00:09.990> had<00:00:10.110> hustled<00:00:10.349> us<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.860> thought<00:00:11.070> they<00:00:11.250> all

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
they had hustled us I thought they all

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.740 
they had hustled us I thought they all
worked<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.759> tonight<00:00:12.090> they<00:00:12.360> were<00:00:12.480> playing

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
worked is tonight they were playing

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.180 
worked is tonight they were playing
harder<00:00:13.110> than<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.380> were<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
harder than we were and I think it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.090 
harder than we were and I think it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
still is a timing is it the knee

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
still is a timing is it the knee
strength<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> mostly<00:01:16.439> why<00:01:17.100> he's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
strength what is it mostly why he's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
strength what is it mostly why he's
shooting<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.360> playing<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.110> just

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
shooting is just playing I think he just

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
shooting is just playing I think he just
needs<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> play<00:01:19.830> some<00:01:20.070> ball<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> he'll<00:01:20.640> be

needs to play some ball and he'll be
fine<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.439> he's<00:01:22.560> getting<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:22.979> strength

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
fine I think he's getting some strength

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.719 
fine I think he's getting some strength
back<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:25.619> looks<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.890> me<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.070> he's<00:01:26.220> trying<00:01:26.640> to

save a step still a little bit here and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.580 
save a step still a little bit here and
there<00:01:29.750> defensively<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:31.049> kind<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.439> hard

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
there defensively that's kind of hard

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.460

that's a little bit times but you know

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.840 
that's a little bit times but you know
he'll<00:01:34.680> pick<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.100> when<00:01:35.369> he<00:01:35.460> gets<00:01:35.640> his<00:01:35.820> uh
