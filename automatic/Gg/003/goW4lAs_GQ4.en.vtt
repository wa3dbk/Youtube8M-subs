00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.090
 system-oriented working from schagen became perspective 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.610
 for a short time as 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.319
 the sp and sgp 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.399
 there is your pc it's one 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.599
 approach 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.570
 for the treatment of young people 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.119
 It is important that we sometimes inform the parents and also the family members, also the family members 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.070
 the help we involved looked back on the system but that worked 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.029
 people 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.649
 we mainly look at the effects of behavior 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.700
 we will as an example 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 Suppose we are going to have a mother in a recent speech 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.020
 then I don't want to be like that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 fascinated at the moment where your tears come from as well as those from the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.649
 family members first 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 a tissue is needed 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240
 so what is the effect 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.350
 from 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.350
 the behavior of the in on the other 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 clean a good soccer player it goes in this region 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.260
 for the woman 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
 yes it is up to you to do almost everything 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.240
 yes I think I just think the idea is the same again 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.159
 and they mainly look at mutual relations 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.149
 and we mainly look at the effect of behavior so when richard says what is what 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.149
 its effect on mother or goods and even more so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.980
 what is the baby so necessary 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.500
 as previously indicated 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.480
 that's a quarter of the premier league 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.690
 no one could be trusted anymore 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 because she's with 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.680
 the original ones are there 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 that has resulted in decades 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.460
 it was just that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.540
 you know that 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.390
 why are the students working 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.810
 a disgust 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 that I up again 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.100
 a little hypocritical is that you then 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.169
 that I otherwise see what happens to the chic 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.669
 the circular frame that time 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.300
 the eu is getting competition 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.300
 the Dutch state 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.039
 our new players 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.659
 stacks 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 zwolle to emmen 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.809
 I like it 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.259
 felt to play vases anyway 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.669
 and I can no longer finish the word 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.179
 towards daughter and 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.380
 mother dear 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.689
 according to the chance of course that he then 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.849
 with its other places and those are signs 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.989
 which is certainly not standing anymore 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.520
 so that is 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.550
 against pattern we are trying to make do 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 true 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.999
 the local 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.739
 the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.109
 it was fantastic 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.869
 there is not much 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.359
 if everyone does the first internship 9 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:14.659
 as 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.659
 almere 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.509
 league 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509
 as a resident of gorredijk work 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.349
 same city 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.639
 that was also intended 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.669
 of course not 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.109
 and I don't think it's a terrible group of riders 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.789
 the supporter 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.789
 are you for the kids now it is so many words 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.779
 libya in peten 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 that went for the young people to vote for 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.469
 as common parents but I think that is very simple 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:52.809
 it i think as my ex wife 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:58.269
 would change that the problem has solved that motion that the games 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.299
 are not allowed here 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.219
 of course it was appreciate 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.979
 the who 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.469
 4 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.599

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.619
