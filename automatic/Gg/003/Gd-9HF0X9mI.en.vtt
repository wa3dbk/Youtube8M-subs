translate brand and does it worth buying
a<00:00:14.240> transit<00:00:15.240> jet<00:00:15.480> rhyme<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> does<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.520> perform

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a transit jet rhyme and does it perform

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.000 
a transit jet rhyme and does it perform
well<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:18.119> PC<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> compare<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
well for your PC so to compare I have a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.340 
well for your PC so to compare I have a
same<00:00:20.310> 4gb<00:00:20.880> ddr3<00:00:21.180> ram<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.050> same

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
same 4gb ddr3 ram with same

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.189 
same 4gb ddr3 ram with same
specification<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.789> Corsair<00:00:24.240> brand<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.750> we

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
specification in a Corsair brand and we

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
specification in a Corsair brand and we
will<00:00:25.350> see<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.769> performs<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.939> better

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
will see how it performs is it better

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.359 
will see how it performs is it better
than<00:00:27.269> other<00:00:27.570> brands<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.590> same<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.220> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
than other brands is it same or it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.439 
than other brands is it same or it's
performed<00:00:29.880> worse

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
performed worse

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
performed worse
first<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.960> will<00:00:31.109> compare<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> physically<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
first we will compare it physically and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
first we will compare it physically and
then<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.149> say<00:00:33.300> sorry<00:00:33.690> about<00:00:33.960> comments

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
then we will say sorry about comments

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.509 
then we will say sorry about comments
and<00:00:34.380> benchmarking<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.309> go

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.889 

so<00:00:44.519> guys<00:00:44.699> first<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> check<00:00:45.839> that

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so guys first we going to check that

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.110 
so guys first we going to check that
does<00:00:46.289> transcend<00:00:46.920> J<00:00:47.159> Trump's<00:00:47.460> physical<00:00:47.909> loop

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
does transcend J Trump's physical loop

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
does transcend J Trump's physical loop
now<00:00:48.780> transition<00:00:49.289> provide<00:00:49.620> two<00:00:49.859> types<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
now transition provide two types of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
now transition provide two types of
ramps<00:00:50.640> first<00:00:50.909> is<00:00:51.120> their<00:00:51.359> basic<00:00:51.600> ramps<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
ramps first is their basic ramps and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.590 
ramps first is their basic ramps and
second<00:00:52.769> is<00:00:52.920> their<00:00:53.190> high-profile<00:00:54.120> ramps<00:00:54.449> for

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
second is their high-profile ramps for

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.689 
second is their high-profile ramps for
gaming<00:00:55.049> actually<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.100> require<00:00:56.489> any

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
gaming actually you don't require any

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.759 
gaming actually you don't require any
heatsinks<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.719> ramps<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.229> it

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
heatsinks for your ramps because it

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.149 
heatsinks for your ramps because it
doesn't<00:00:59.539> heat<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.570> too<00:01:00.899> much<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.589> only<00:01:01.979> a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
doesn't heat up too much it is only a

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.789 
doesn't heat up too much it is only a
marketing<00:01:02.760> purpose<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.360> must<00:01:03.659> say<00:01:03.839> so<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> speak

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
marketing purpose I must say so to speak

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.179 
marketing purpose I must say so to speak
so<00:01:05.430> guys<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.479> looking<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.350> physically<00:01:07.830> design

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
so guys now looking at physically design

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.190 
so guys now looking at physically design
it's<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:10.069> normal<00:01:11.069> look<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> nothing

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
it's really a normal look and nothing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
it's really a normal look and nothing
fancy<00:01:13.200> look<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:14.670> you've

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
fancy look here at the back side you've

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
fancy look here at the back side you've
got<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.149> blue<00:01:15.630> chip<00:01:15.899> design<00:01:16.289> and<00:01:16.740> nothing<00:01:17.250> fancy

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
got a blue chip design and nothing fancy

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.639 
got a blue chip design and nothing fancy
look<00:01:17.789> here<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.300> get<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> same<00:01:19.200> look<00:01:19.440> in

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
look here and you get the same look in

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.999 
look here and you get the same look in
any<00:01:19.830> gem<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> buy<00:01:20.880> whether<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.050> is<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> 4gb<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
any gem you buy whether it is a 4gb it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.639

buy whether in coarser you just get a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.660 
buy whether in coarser you just get a
sticker<00:01:29.069> over<00:01:29.340> it

afterwards<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.780> video<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.069> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
afterwards in this video now this is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.430 
afterwards in this video now this is
about<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.759> physical<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.509> physical<00:01:46.080> look<00:01:46.229> is

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
about the physical look physical look is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.749 
about the physical look physical look is
not<00:01:46.709> a<00:01:46.739> fancy<00:01:47.310> along<00:01:47.729> Allah<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:49.160> yeah<00:01:50.160> we<00:01:50.550> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
not a fancy along Allah but yeah we have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
not a fancy along Allah but yeah we have
to<00:01:50.879> actually<00:01:51.300> check<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.539> performance<00:01:51.810> rather

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to actually check the performance rather

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.009 
to actually check the performance rather
than<00:01:52.679> its<00:01:53.009> physical<00:01:53.429> look<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.879> there's<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:55.019 
than its physical look and there's a

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:58.249 
than its physical look and there's a
kind<00:01:55.679> of<00:01:55.860> cheap<00:01:56.129> look<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.640> yeah<00:01:56.879> let's<00:01:57.569> go<00:01:57.750> now

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
kind of cheap look but yeah let's go now

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.719 
kind of cheap look but yeah let's go now
we're<00:01:58.440> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.709> check<00:01:58.950> his<00:01:59.099> performance<00:01:59.550> in

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
we're going to check his performance in

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.930 
we're going to check his performance in
gaming<00:02:00.179> in<00:02:00.360> benchmarking<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.349> how<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.789> be

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
gaming in benchmarking and how it can be

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.059 
gaming in benchmarking and how it can be
overclocked<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.720> can<00:02:03.989> it<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.259> used<00:02:04.440> in<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
overclocked and can it be used in the

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.770 
overclocked and can it be used in the
world<00:02:05.250> channels<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> pourcel<00:02:06.569> Ram

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
world channels with the pourcel Ram

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.699 
world channels with the pourcel Ram
let's<00:02:07.200> go

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
let's go

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.800 
let's go
so<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.640> after<00:02:08.789> taking<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.390> physical

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so that's after taking out the physical

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.089 
so that's after taking out the physical
performance<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.349> both<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.679> their<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> am<00:02:10.950> now

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
performance of both of their I am now

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.170 
performance of both of their I am now
it's<00:02:11.250> time<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.519> check<00:02:11.790> out<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> high

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
it's time to check out the high

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's time to check out the high
performance<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.900> both<00:02:13.080> Rams

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
performance of both Rams

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.710 
performance of both Rams
now<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> new<00:02:15.360> events

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
now what are you this is the new events

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.119 
now what are you this is the new events
match<00:02:15.900> marking<00:02:16.230> tool<00:02:16.379> which<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> great<00:02:16.920> tool

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
match marking tool which is a great tool

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.530 
match marking tool which is a great tool
to<00:02:17.280> check<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> performances<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to check out the performances of the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.960 
to check out the performances of the
hardware<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.709> has<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> overall<00:02:20.430> score<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
hardware now it has a overall score and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.839 
hardware now it has a overall score and
a<00:02:21.060> ram<00:02:21.269> score<00:02:21.659> individual<00:02:22.140> tests<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.519> what<00:02:23.819> I

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
a ram score individual tests now what I

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.850 
a ram score individual tests now what I
did<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.390> first<00:02:24.659> used<00:02:24.840> calcium<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.650> check

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
did is I first used calcium and check

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.530 
did is I first used calcium and check
its<00:02:26.010> performance<00:02:26.489> then<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.760> used<00:02:26.970> transitorium

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
its performance then I used transitorium

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.149 
its performance then I used transitorium
and<00:02:27.690> check<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.140> performance<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.860> I

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
and check out this performance and I

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.130 
and check out this performance and I
then<00:02:29.430> used<00:02:29.700> both<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.180> them<00:02:30.420> together<00:02:30.599> in<00:02:30.959> dual

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
then used both of them together in dual

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.410 
then used both of them together in dual
channel<00:02:31.470> mode<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.550> surprised<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.390> see

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
channel mode and I was surprised to see

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.180 
channel mode and I was surprised to see
that<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> both<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> RAM<00:02:34.470> two<00:02:34.680> together<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that the both of the RAM two together is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.070 
that the both of the RAM two together is
running<00:02:35.489> very<00:02:35.700> smoothly<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.629> now<00:02:36.780> let's<00:02:37.019> check

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
running very smoothly so now let's check

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.050 
running very smoothly so now let's check
out<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.470> coarser<00:02:38.190> ram<00:02:38.400> result<00:02:38.670> for

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
out the coarser ram result for

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.910 
out the coarser ram result for
now<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.630> can<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.230> RAM<00:02:40.410> speed<00:02:40.770> is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
now as you can see that the RAM speed is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.630 
now as you can see that the RAM speed is
3<00:02:41.490> 1<00:02:41.790> 5<00:02:42.000> 3<00:02:42.060> megabits<00:02:42.720> per<00:02:42.900> second<00:02:43.410> with<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> score

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
3 1 5 3 megabits per second with a score

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.150 
3 1 5 3 megabits per second with a score
of<00:02:44.670> 110<00:02:45.600> now<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.260> will<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.650> surprised<00:02:47.010> after

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
of 110 now you will be surprised after

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280 
of 110 now you will be surprised after
seeing<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.580> transcend<00:02:48.000> results<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:49.050> is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
seeing the transcend results and that is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.350 
seeing the transcend results and that is
very<00:02:49.620> similar<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> score<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.730> course<00:02:51.000> erm

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
very similar to the score of course erm

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.180 
very similar to the score of course erm
now<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.410> surprising<00:02:53.040> because

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
now this is really surprising because

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.190 
now this is really surprising because
guys<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.330> difference<00:02:54.780> between<00:02:54.960> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
guys the difference between the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.620 
guys the difference between the
transient<00:02:55.620> geumsan<00:02:56.130> culture<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.820> pricing<00:02:57.450> is

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
transient geumsan culture in pricing is

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.970 
transient geumsan culture in pricing is
very<00:02:57.690> much<00:02:58.410> and<00:03:00.110> after<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.470> both<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
very much and after that the both of the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.150 
very much and after that the both of the
rams<00:03:02.220> are<00:03:02.400> performing<00:03:02.880> equally<00:03:03.570> well<00:03:04.160> also

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
rams are performing equally well also

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.720 
rams are performing equally well also
the<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.640> also<00:03:06.090> check<00:03:06.420> out<00:03:06.570> after<00:03:06.930> using<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the I also check out after using a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.100 
the I also check out after using a
extensive<00:03:08.730> use<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.000> PC<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> also<00:03:09.630> check<00:03:09.930> out

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
extensive use of PC I also check out

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.920 
extensive use of PC I also check out
that<00:03:10.320> Ram<00:03:10.800> heating<00:03:11.670> capacity<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.570> test

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
that Ram heating capacity and I test

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.810 
that Ram heating capacity and I test
both<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.470> RAM<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.340> surprised<00:03:14.730> that

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
both of the RAM and I was surprised that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.090 
both of the RAM and I was surprised that
you<00:03:15.240> actually<00:03:15.570> don't<00:03:15.990> need<00:03:16.200> any<00:03:16.380> heating<00:03:16.680> for

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
you actually don't need any heating for

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.700 
you actually don't need any heating for
the<00:03:17.130> Rams<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.300> were<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.720> heat<00:03:19.350> very

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
the Rams because they were not heat very

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.020 
the Rams because they were not heat very
much<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.440> now<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.770> must<00:03:23.340> show<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> dual

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
much so and now I must show you the dual

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.390 
much so and now I must show you the dual
channel<00:03:24.450> results<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> dual

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
channel results so this is the dual

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.420 
channel results so this is the dual
Channel<00:03:26.820> results<00:03:27.180> guys<00:03:27.470> one<00:03:28.470> minute<00:03:28.710> now<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
Channel results guys one minute now you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.400 
Channel results guys one minute now you
can<00:03:29.760> see<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.060> after<00:03:30.270> using<00:03:30.630> both<00:03:30.990> of<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.290> RAM

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
can see that after using both of the RAM

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.010 
can see that after using both of the RAM
together<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.070> see<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.490> memory<00:03:33.300> space

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
together you can see the memory space

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.960 
together you can see the memory space
develop<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.220> see<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.490> score<00:03:35.730> just

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
develop and you can see the score just

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.470 
develop and you can see the score just
jumped<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.710> 160<00:03:37.710> with<00:03:37.890> overall<00:03:38.160> score<00:03:38.490> of<00:03:38.520> 845

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
jumped to 160 with overall score of 845

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.690 
jumped to 160 with overall score of 845
which<00:03:39.990> is<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> great<00:03:40.470> improvement<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.160> which

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
which is a great improvement and which

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.320 
which is a great improvement and which
will<00:03:41.940> really<00:03:42.420> be<00:03:43.020> helpful<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:44.090> playing<00:03:45.090> games

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
will really be helpful in playing games

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.270 
will really be helpful in playing games
you<00:03:45.720> will<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.290> I've<00:03:46.530> pasted<00:03:46.830> boost<00:03:47.100> of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
you will see and I've pasted boost of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.760 
you will see and I've pasted boost of
around<00:03:47.580> 10<00:03:47.850> 5<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.450> 10<00:03:48.630> FPS<00:03:48.810> which<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> great

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
around 10 5 to 10 FPS which is a great

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.570 
around 10 5 to 10 FPS which is a great
boost<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.150> ramp<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.950> may<00:03:53.220> really

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
boost for just a ramp so you may really

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.400 
boost for just a ramp so you may really
go<00:03:53.850> for<00:03:54.150> transition<00:03:54.720> time<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.050> not<00:03:55.200> really

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
go for transition time is not really

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.690 
go for transition time is not really
going<00:03:56.010> for<00:03:56.310> by<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> 4gb<00:03:57.300> ddr3<00:03:57.600> RAM<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:59.280> also

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
going for by a 4gb ddr3 RAM and I also

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.370 
going for by a 4gb ddr3 RAM and I also
checked<00:04:00.060> out<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.360> overclocking<00:04:00.930> performance

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
checked out the overclocking performance

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.050 
checked out the overclocking performance
of<00:04:01.500> both<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.950> ramps<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.700> thing<00:04:03.030> is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
of both of the ramps now the thing is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.600 
of both of the ramps now the thing is
well<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.230> will<00:04:04.380> overclock<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:04.860> ramps<00:04:05.340> you

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
well you will overclock the ramps you

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.949 
well you will overclock the ramps you
will<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:05.970> around<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:07.580> 101<00:04:08.580> 6<00:04:09.090> double<00:04:09.360> 0<00:04:09.630> makers

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
will get around on 101 6 double 0 makers

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.670 
will get around on 101 6 double 0 makers
I<00:04:10.140> was<00:04:10.290> able<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.620> run<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.980> both

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
I was able to run the both

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.860 
I was able to run the both
together<00:04:12.129> with<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.640> clock<00:04:13.030> rate<00:04:13.299> of<00:04:13.480> leaven

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
together with a clock rate of leaven

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.909 
together with a clock rate of leaven
which<00:04:14.049> was<00:04:15.299> comparable<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.660> lower<00:04:17.079> rate<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:17.889> a

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
which was comparable a lower rate with a

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.979 
which was comparable a lower rate with a
one<00:04:18.400> triple<00:04:18.669> three<00:04:18.910> makers<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.539> clock<00:04:19.750> or

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
one triple three makers and clock or

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.290 
one triple three makers and clock or
from<00:04:20.169> eleven<00:04:20.500> o'clock<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:21.130> nine<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.090> guys

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
from eleven o'clock of nine so guys

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.710 
from eleven o'clock of nine so guys
better<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.289> run<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:24.060> memory<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.150> one<00:04:25.449> triple

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
better to run the memory on one triple

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.749 
better to run the memory on one triple
three<00:04:25.900> makers<00:04:26.229> with<00:04:26.440> clock<00:04:26.710> nine<00:04:26.949> rather<00:04:27.520> than

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
three makers with clock nine rather than

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.790 
three makers with clock nine rather than
one<00:04:27.970> double<00:04:28.210> six<00:04:28.509> one<00:04:28.900> six<00:04:29.080> double<00:04:29.199> zero<00:04:29.590> on

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
one double six one six double zero on

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.040 
one double six one six double zero on
clock<00:04:30.190> eleven<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.759> also<00:04:31.210> tried<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.720> run<00:04:31.870> the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
clock eleven I also tried to run the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.890 
clock eleven I also tried to run the
Rams<00:04:32.889> on<00:04:33.160> one<00:04:33.370> six<00:04:33.880> double<00:04:34.150> zero<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.570> clock

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
Rams on one six double zero with clock

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.860 
Rams on one six double zero with clock
nine<00:04:35.110> but<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.650> will<00:04:35.860> hang<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.340> game<00:04:36.690> also<00:04:37.690> it

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
nine but it will hang the game also it

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.629 
nine but it will hang the game also it
shows<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.590> RAM<00:04:38.800> was<00:04:38.979> not<00:04:39.190> performing

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
shows that the RAM was not performing

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.659 
shows that the RAM was not performing
together<00:04:39.850> well<00:04:40.389> on<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:41.259> configuration<00:04:41.919> so

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
together well on that configuration so

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.700 
together well on that configuration so
this<00:04:42.910> was<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.330> results<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:44.229> six<00:04:44.440> double

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
this was the results on one six double

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.510 
this was the results on one six double
zero<00:04:44.940> dual<00:04:45.940> channel<00:04:46.330> mode<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:48.190> can<00:04:48.220> see

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
zero dual channel mode and you can see

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.490 
zero dual channel mode and you can see
it<00:04:48.699> decreased<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.240> bit<00:04:49.270> performance<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.259> no

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
it decreased a bit performance so no

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.589 
it decreased a bit performance so no
improvement<00:04:51.070> at<00:04:51.190> all<00:04:51.340> because<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.210> timings

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
improvement at all because the timings

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.129 
improvement at all because the timings
were<00:04:52.949> increased<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.550> you<00:04:54.639> have<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.030> take<00:04:55.900> care

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
were increased so you have to take care

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.050 
were increased so you have to take care
of<00:04:56.169> all<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.770> things<00:04:57.009> now<00:04:57.310> I'm<00:04:57.490> going<00:04:57.759> to<00:04:57.880> show

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
of all the things now I'm going to show

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.260 
of all the things now I'm going to show
you<00:04:58.120> this<00:04:58.979> clock<00:04:59.979> rates<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.460> both<00:05:00.639> or<00:05:00.789> both<00:05:01.240> of

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
you this clock rates of both or both of

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:10.430 
you this clock rates of both or both of
the<00:05:01.509> RAM<00:05:01.660> right<00:05:01.840> now<00:05:02.050> once<00:05:02.860> again<00:05:03.009> guys

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.250 

so<00:05:11.010> guys<00:05:11.930> one<00:05:12.930> second<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.470> loading<00:05:13.800> guys<00:05:15.260> so

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
so guys one second it is loading guys so

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.590 
so guys one second it is loading guys so
as<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.890> can<00:05:17.010> see<00:05:17.070> here<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:18.090> both<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.510> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
as you can see here the both of the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.300 
as you can see here the both of the
ramps<00:05:18.870> are<00:05:18.990> together<00:05:19.110> running<00:05:19.620> on<00:05:19.740> nine<00:05:20.010> nine

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
ramps are together running on nine nine

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.850 
ramps are together running on nine nine
nine<00:05:20.340> twenty<00:05:20.850> four<00:05:21.030> times<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.690> at<00:05:22.230> six<00:05:22.680> six

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
nine twenty four times and at six six

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.650 
nine twenty four times and at six six
six<00:05:23.010> mega<00:05:23.460> switches<00:05:23.910> one<00:05:24.210> triple<00:05:24.480> three

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
six mega switches one triple three

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.160 
six mega switches one triple three
makers<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.920> this<00:05:26.160> is<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.340> great<00:05:27.170> configuration

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
makers so this is a great configuration

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.380 
makers so this is a great configuration
for<00:05:28.350> your<00:05:28.500> PC<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.010> you<00:05:29.370> can<00:05:29.550> actually<00:05:29.700> use<00:05:30.180> it

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
for your PC and you can actually use it

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.390 
for your PC and you can actually use it
and<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:31.050> Ram<00:05:31.290> performs<00:05:31.980> really<00:05:32.250> well<00:05:32.400> and

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
and this Ram performs really well and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.850 
and this Ram performs really well and
that's<00:05:35.400> this<00:05:35.640> guys<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.180> you<00:05:36.630> must<00:05:37.080> buy<00:05:37.410> it<00:05:37.440> if

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
that's this guys and you must buy it if

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.580 
that's this guys and you must buy it if
you<00:05:38.070> are<00:05:38.100> used<00:05:38.750> exploring<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.900> ram<00:05:40.080> for<00:05:40.380> one

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
you are used exploring a ram for one

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.680 
you are used exploring a ram for one
table<00:05:40.860> three<00:05:41.010> makers<00:05:41.370> at<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.820> clock<00:05:42.060> nine<00:05:42.330> level

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
table three makers at a clock nine level

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.750 
table three makers at a clock nine level
yeah<00:05:43.440> one<00:05:43.800> more<00:05:43.920> thing<00:05:43.980> else<00:05:44.310> if<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:44.700> are

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
yeah one more thing else if you are

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.580 
yeah one more thing else if you are
using<00:05:44.970> individual<00:05:45.480> transcend<00:05:45.930> ram<00:05:46.110> or<00:05:46.320> both

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
using individual transcend ram or both

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.530 
using individual transcend ram or both
of<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.860> rams<00:05:47.070> are<00:05:47.250> of<00:05:47.430> same<00:05:47.670> brand<00:05:48.000> then<00:05:48.420> you

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
of the rams are of same brand then you

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.500 
of the rams are of same brand then you
can<00:05:48.750> actually<00:05:48.960> come<00:05:49.440> for<00:05:49.680> use<00:05:50.460> this<00:05:50.730> rams<00:05:51.090> also

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
can actually come for use this rams also

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.080 
can actually come for use this rams also
on<00:05:51.600> crop<00:05:51.930> six<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.470> seven<00:05:52.830> timings<00:05:53.430> which<00:05:53.940> i

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
on crop six and seven timings which i

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.930 
on crop six and seven timings which i
confirm<00:05:54.540> on<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:55.070> specifications<00:05:56.070> but<00:05:56.700> I'm

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
confirm on the specifications but I'm

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.760 
confirm on the specifications but I'm
using<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.510> both<00:05:57.660> Rams<00:05:57.930> together<00:05:58.290> so<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:58.590> have

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
using the both Rams together so I have

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.350 
using the both Rams together so I have
to<00:05:58.950> configure<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.610> in<00:05:59.760> eight<00:06:00.030> o'clock<00:06:00.330> nine

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
to configure it in eight o'clock nine

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.320 
to configure it in eight o'clock nine
level<00:06:00.900> actually<00:06:01.260> even<00:06:01.920> Corsair<00:06:02.370> M<00:06:02.520> is<00:06:02.670> not

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
level actually even Corsair M is not

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330 
level actually even Corsair M is not
able<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.810> clock<00:06:04.080> at<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.530> lower<00:06:04.920> level<00:06:05.010> than

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
able to clock at a lower level than

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.600 
able to clock at a lower level than
clock<00:06:05.850> nine<00:06:06.090> so<00:06:06.660> I<00:06:07.050> may<00:06:07.350> say<00:06:07.740> that<00:06:07.950> the<00:06:08.160> transit

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
clock nine so I may say that the transit

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.850 
clock nine so I may say that the transit
Ram<00:06:08.790> is<00:06:08.970> performing<00:06:09.420> well<00:06:09.630> or<00:06:09.930> better<00:06:10.530> than

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
Ram is performing well or better than

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.400 
Ram is performing well or better than
call<00:06:11.100> say<00:06:11.280> Ram<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:12.090> that's<00:06:12.330> it<00:06:12.480> guys<00:06:12.510> thanks

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
call say Ram so that's it guys thanks

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.820
