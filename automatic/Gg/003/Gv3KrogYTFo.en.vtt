00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
one is even smaller so I can't read this

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.729 
one is even smaller so I can't read this
from<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.800> angle<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.550> if<00:02:56.230> i<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.650> to

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
