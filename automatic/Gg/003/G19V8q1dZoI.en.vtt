 show made you all maps 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.170
 a bit in my initial opinion and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 the initial impressions on the four 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 maps okay and clear as the week went by 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 passing and me bringing videos 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.700
 specific to each of the maps I will 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 talk because glédson zombies 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.570
 finally taking advantage of the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 men you want to see contents of 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 men most likely moment in 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.219
 that these videos even though on my channel 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.500
 already has video of jackson lake descends pro 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.480
 play ok, you should leave now six hours from 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.949

 will be here in the application for you 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.610
 take a look at the video there folks 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.750
 Playing is for men and Bruninho is only seven 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 Something else also came out the pet is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.030
 again today I'm a video with 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.979
 pilots if not no later than tomorrow 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 right after lunch you already have a video on the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.420
 channel with pets notes 1960 account 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 xbox launch a giant patch with 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.790
 notebook and many modifications 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.290
 Ok, let's talk about the right maps. 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.140
 The first map I'm going to tell you is the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.409
 site show map that is perhaps the best 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.450
 map of lc kuta is a very interesting 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.549
 that clown map is what goes on there 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.460
 sort of a hotel or motel not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.829
 it will be abandoned that that clown is 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 he the rather peculiar map I found 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.030
 very interesting because it takes a lot 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.140
 open and even it being a very milestone 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.360
 Open 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.799
 It gives you and play it for smg 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 example gameplay issue including 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.229
 background is with a smg né it is better yes 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.200
 for the snip autographs of firearms 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.869
 long range really but anyway 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.610
 I found it very interesting 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 weapon category and a very 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 different from the maps we have 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.600
 in this game in general 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.910
 open and does not have many obstructions it 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.010
 has no complex paths is not well 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.870
 even open and you have to know if 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.510
 around the edges of the map and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.920
 to use the houses well have several houses and 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.510
 whenever you kill a guy it's a lot 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.790
 useful you to enter inside the house to 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.610
 catch cover or climb to the second 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.960
 go to bed and is finally Penacova 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.090
 how open it is 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.230
 you can be seen from many places or 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.640
 especially if you have more in the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.140
 center area of ​​the map then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.150
 mainly by the people who are in the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.280
 Neither roofs have several roofs that you 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.440
 can access and you are on the roofs 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 and has vast view of the map 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.590
 so I found the map that works 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.630
 very clear he has the event 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.240
 dynamic than the clown himself 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.070
 giant and releases a bomb that left a 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.050
 rainbow trail and everything you 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.060
 Throw bomb, killed face. You saw it now. 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.670
 in this scene with capture for example the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.040
 ball seems to have 11 black hills is a one 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.930
 reach large explosion and kill expensive 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.820
 extremely cool, very cool, very funny 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.670
 clown even speaks a few things well 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.400
 cool and me darks well I liked it 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.340
 enough of the laughter that gives you the second 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.860
 The pre has to be the core map that 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.230
 map is in the desert, I found one 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.269
 map more or less he was one 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.820
 The center and coastline are 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.220
 center and in that center 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.959
 you have four entries each entry right 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.930
 goes to the corners of the map then 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.700
 it basically works all over the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.580
 basically works around this 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.220
 center then the action is very spread 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.650
 It is a map that passes slowly and takes time. 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.989
 to happen the action flows but it is a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.660
 interesting still is I did not like it 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.090
 both by them and too complex a medium is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.250
 Being very uneven knows things like that. 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.230
 so the red bulls boring also have the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.480
 parts of the whole and are not very dark 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.940
 anyway it's on a map that usually does not 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.560
 pleases but is also interesting because it is 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.540
 different from the maps we already have 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.100
 on pattern in iron wars advance liked 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.370
 enough of the city maps should be 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.019
 because it is they are several maps them 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.459
 they are not equal to each other either 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.799
 They are equal in relation to the map 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.420
 people already have a difference from the 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.250
 this map runs that map neither stinks nor 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.479
 I can smell it, but it's nothing. 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.269
 Amazing 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.370
 then we have ift map that is 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.180
 The map I liked - this is the map of 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.550
 snow 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.860
 and it 's a map he has 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.569
 average size is it a map of 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.129
 medium size only works as if 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.810
 was a small size map 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.490
 It's difficult to explain but it's a map. 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.490
 extremely frantic you will die 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.060
 behind all the time the backup is half 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.009
 stranger on this map goes're a 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.000
 kind of a kind of a resort 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.220
 finally there in the cold place is an avalanche 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.020
 inclusive avalanche picks up an entire street 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.400
 the street map is not banned but 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.530
 can continue to use only can not 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.919
 be on the street the moment they fall 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.199
 if you die but at last he is the map 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.460
 strange because he as I told him 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.159
 has a medium size size 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 relatively large but it works 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.870
 as if it were a small one is very 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.669
 chaotic aa mess works great 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.440
 in the middle of the map on the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.139
 carousels is more an area that you 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.569
 You will not want to go right and you basically 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.819
 It has the street on one side and the other Street 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.129
 street from above or from below to above 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.599
 happens the avalanche the ball takes and are 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.569
 the very busy all the time goes 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.370
 there are people dying there killing and 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.900
 everything else is downtown 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.150
 So let's say the carousels 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.389
 where is the most deadly place you can 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.069
 staying there is very frenetic any 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.449
 Any time you have there you can 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.090
 see behind because there are many 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.080
 entrances to the central street on the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.360
 up and down 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.330
 finally it's a map that I did not like very much 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.370
 I was not very good and faithful - I liked this 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.830
 of this beautiful and lastly we have 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.349
 an urban map which is basically what 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.229
 that adverse affair of the affair is only 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.300
 a smaller capital than in the capital is I 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.069
 I was not expecting a map, yes he is. 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.349
 very frenetic is too small you 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.690
 born of two 10 forward you are already 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.090
 in the middle of the action again is he has a 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.419
 center and both sides of the hospital is 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.490
 basically this is a very very map 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.940
 small it is not even smaller than 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.580
 to the chip nec also had its version of 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.770
 goals but has been enlarged but he is 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.740
 very chaotic very small you go 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.229
 kill died time all the time all 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.629
 anyway it is a map that really reminds me 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.279
 surprised and liberty to play is that 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.969
 Do you like small maps like me? 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.500
 taste 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.930
 you'll like if you hate the 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.500
 little like I do not hate you 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.770
 hate the little ones 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.170
 The whole city though not good again. 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.100
 enough to play at a high level 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.810
 is in this type of maps in the console still 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.950
 so then please hopefully I liked 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.180
 maybe it was the second 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.600
 you from this series c 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.160
 just I did not like but less than 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.500
 showtime showtime 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.060
 now I've forgotten showtime but at last I think 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.680
 that's because now I'm remembering that 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.090
 already had a map of lcd or so called 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.310
 showtime 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.050
 anyway this is my brief analysis 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.000
 about each of the maps as I said 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.290
 then I'm likely to make a 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.200
 analysis for each of the maps 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.270
 then right then as I said 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.450
 of time today, there is still a video with the 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.580
 pet notes that the pet is out for the xbox 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.680
 wii and xbox 360 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.000
 If there is no time tomorrow, I should go. 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.310
 also make a promotional video about 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.800
 men but as I said has the 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.820
 men down there pro play access there and 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.500
 from tomorrow you will also have 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.960
 again from 4 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.350
 will have diary is edson matches 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.270
 shadow
