 very much they are boys who 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.469
 however, they do not leave the facebook page 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.040
 in description and their youtube channel 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.250
 they even did one 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.150

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.620

 the jobs you will do will be free 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
 basically they will want it 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.360
 simply advertising anyway 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.400
 I'm doing this for now 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 I say advertising without problems but not 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.310
 it's advertising because they don't fit me 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 paying his best they did it one 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.490
 great job and really deserve to 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.900
 get to know at least really help e 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.240
 I very willingly why not 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.470
 they are helping me and I obviously help 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.380
 they very willingly however you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.630
 leave the only indiscretion and after 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.930
 I wanted to tell you that as you have noticed 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.820
 I'm also having a light one holding a 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.060
 slight help with regard to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.549
 video thumbnails here 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.369
 it's an outside help this guy here yes 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.740
 call cyber hornet I wouldn't want to plow the 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.539
 his name is always part of 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.579
 however he was innovative of 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.899
 you could will chin we can try 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.460
 to talk about it I gladly accepted 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.890
 balance also its linking 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 description basically these here 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.149
 in fact they are a group of young people 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.860
 deals with graphics 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.450
 the fact is that maybe many of Milan 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.819
 because who has seven thousand members from 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.620
 7,000 written up will receive these 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.200
 these favors love you so 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 these free jobs instead those who have 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.730
 less will have to pay because in my opinion 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.200
 however the work must be repaid 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.790
 I obviously isolating it in the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.319
 advertising and less than space 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 because maybe some of you have 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.980
 interested and will decide to buy i 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.410
 their works that he obviously noticed 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.730
 you can see my layout but also in the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.290
 their channel is all the videos neither 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.000
 speedart they did and in my opinion 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.950
 they are all really beautiful 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.440
 so really guys on really 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.760
 leg in my opinion deserve a lot and me 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.690
 invite them to pass their channel but 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.760
 speaking of other 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.040
 I also wanted to tell you that a 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.070

 some questions 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.730
 if I'm not super shit if possible 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.560
 I'm happier because I think that 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.450
 the specific software will want to do it more in 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.579
 so there are generic questions there 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.470
 I am very pleased I happened to 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.909

 quotes because you know that beautiful stuff 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.310
 just ask a generic question 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.680
 maybe even very interesting at 101 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.269

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.500

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.540
 even those who don't care if some 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.760
 more interesting question e 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.470

 forgive me for building a little short but 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.540

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.430
 this favor for this wonderful team 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.879

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.159

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.859

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.129
