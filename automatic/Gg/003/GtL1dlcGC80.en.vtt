00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.010
 hello coll friends how are you I am 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.350
 rodrigo muÃ±oz altea and we are going to make a 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.910
 top five of those things that we want to see 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.650
 that make augmented reality in the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.540
 future maybe they are things that then 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.000
 they are still very far there still we 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.369
 how to perfect this technology 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.630
 but then microsoft showed us this 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.950
 operating technology us 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.599
 It moved us a lot and we were like 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.009
 talking in the office to see what 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.500
 it was what excited us most where 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.300
 could this TV reach this technology and 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.739
 Well let's see the top 5 of things that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 it occurred to us that we want to see from 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.100
 this 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.050
 because in number 5 we have the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.899
 advertising obviously this is going to be a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.519
 of the things that will first arise or 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.199
 that the puzles the advertisers are going to 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.479
 try to see how they sell us things 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.949
 obviously and then we will be seeing 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.449
 I do not know of maybe a magazine and 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.579
 suddenly with your glasses you will see that you 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.680
 it comes out like a hologram and you're going to be 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.359
 seeing what you're going to buy that cereal or 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.609
 you are selling because maybe a 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.170
 best lenses and something very interesting is 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.640
 that maybe the lenses do not remain 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.289
 once on the windshield of your car and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.700
 let's have this technology and you are seeing 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.500
 instead of spectacular as 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.350
 holograms that are coming out all 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.659
 sides like this and could become 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.459
 something very interesting especially for the 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.140
 companies that could even subsidize 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.970
 the lenses and say well you know if 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.289
 you agree to see cocacola advertising one 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.289
 as long as you do it 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.909
 we discount about 200 dollars and nothing more 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.110
 you're going to pay 100 for them or even this one 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.340
 they give it to you as long as you're 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 watching advertising all the time 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.600
 well imagine that you enter a room 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.060
 white and then all slam with the furniture 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.950
 the ceiling pictures all suddenly you 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.080
 you put your glasses on and they take life 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.480
 pictures the furniture already have color all 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.010
 It is decorated as you like it and therefore 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.570
 also people could go in to see the 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.100
 things like you like to see the pictures 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.990
 of your preference this is something very 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.700
 interesting that could have the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.290
 entertainment there is entertainment of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.880
 the decoration forgiveness and also the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.130
 entertainment that's why we put it in the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 number 4 and I mention entertainment 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.550
 because you could also watch television 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.960
 no longer would no longer screens 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.280
 necessary other things simply you 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.200
 You put your glasses and you are seeing a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.330
 big screen on the wall you can 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 Make big girl like you want and 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.120
 you can also see your networks 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.470
 you can have as some 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.630
 squares with social networks the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.640
 you squeeze and you're watching some tweets or 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.200
 facebook this technology has these 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.370
 applications that can be very 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.370
 interesting in the future 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.830
 in number 3 of course we have the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.480
 science this is a branch that could 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.610
 form an enormous utility of this 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.650
 technology because I do not know how to imagine 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.120
 that a specialist doctor in a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.770
 disease that you have lives in japan 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.690
 but you are in Sweden because he 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.760
 you can perfectly see a 3d model of 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.770
 You see how your heart is having 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
 wrong that could be done and could even 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.520
 use it to operate at a distance because 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 the technology is already at that point 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.990
 in terms of operating someone from a distance 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.000
 refers to remote operations but 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.350
 then do it with a hologram that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.810
 It is helping to see the patient as 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.000
 it would be something much better but nothing more 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 medicine would benefit from this but 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.510
 that also everything that has to do 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.880
 with engineering or this kind of thing 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.710
 could be very very benefited because 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.930
 imagine that because you are arming I do not know 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.030
 a harrier or a very large plane you can 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.500
 do it in a small room because 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.090
 nothing else are you moving the pieces 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.190
 because they are holograms do not exist 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.200
 then since you make that piece it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.420
 they can print either in 3d or 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.340
 manufacture otherwise I do not know this 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.230
 It has so many ways to be used in the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.190
 science and these are two and that's why 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.190
 we have in number three 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.910
 as the number 2 is the most we 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.880
 excited in the office and they are the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.430
 video games is out thanks to the video 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.350
 that showed us microsoft with minecraft and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.450
 we could see more or less how it would be 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.640
 this technology applied in this in this 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.470
 world where you can put us some 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.360
 explosives on the wall and it explodes and you see 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.060
 the whole world of minecraft as well as what 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.640
 far you can see the sky and each one of 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
 the furniture of your home in your room 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.480
 where you are can be transformed as in 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.400
 You can mine a picture of minecraft 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.290
 you can be doing things this is 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 he sees very interesting but not nothing more 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.250
 would work for minecraft this would be 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.350
 more or less maybe like in the movie 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.640
 from here we are seeing this 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.050
 person who is like running 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.330
 using the fingers that could be 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.160
 do with kinect and it is seeing your 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.720
 movement and you can be running with 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.070
 the monkey and doing things and you're 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.049
 watching as you turn around and suddenly 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.000
 you have a cri for back I do not know this 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.920
 technology could give us many 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.570
 many hours of entertainment because 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.250
 we could also do it like to 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.380
 make puzzles of these games like 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.000
 fez and I do not know how to stop because the tower 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.590
 in front and be moving it to be 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.780
 solving riddles in something that 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.729
 it really does not exist and this is very 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.949
 interesting because 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.050
 history of video games us 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.839
 we have been visiting his world and I 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.169
 I read makes it possible for your world to visit 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:48.169
 our 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.999
 and in number 1, let's be honest 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.399
 Well this porn this thing that made 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.929
 popular to the internet part of what 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:00.939
 made popular because there is also the mail 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:02.919
 and those things that work, but the 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.629
 porn was what he did that 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.979
 will explode internet the whole world like 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.109
 that crazy as it is something that does not 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.459
 you mean like but the truth 

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:11.529
 then most of us have 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:13.089
 seen minimal porn there on the computer 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.639
 of someone or whatever but we have 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:17.499
 been seeing this this kind of 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.089
 entertainment for adults and it is very 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:21.969
 likely that I read it if this 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:25.089
 Augmented reality technology use 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.859
 Well, the holograms and the things that you do 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.359
 these glasses so you have the girl 

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:30.249
 more beautiful next to you or what you 

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:32.259
 like or the guy I say depends on each 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.329
 who and have fun then good 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.979
 healthily alone with you with your 

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:37.269
 couple I do not know you can choose this one 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.240
 steel this technology what 

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:40.919
 absolutely want 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.630
 and well, these were the five 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.220
 things we want to see with reality 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.270
 increased to those who interested us the most 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.380
 here in the office those that gave us 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.080
 discuss and they were not talking 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.840
 several hours and then you know the like to 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.060
 subscribe video and you already know how to use 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.099
 youtube and see you in the next where 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.099
 We'll have another top 5 interesting
