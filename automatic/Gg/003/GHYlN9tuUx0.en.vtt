though<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> office<00:00:10.620> didn't<00:00:11.070> capitalize<00:00:11.809> the

of times if we got the first down great
we<00:01:29.100> didn't<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.490> 4th<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> 10<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
we didn't want to be 4th and 10 so I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
we didn't want to be 4th and 10 so I
think<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.110> why<00:01:31.200> some<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.439> our<00:01:31.590> third<00:01:31.829> down

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
think that's why some of our third down

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.230 
think that's why some of our third down
converting<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.520> don't<00:01:32.670> order<00:01:32.820> third<00:01:33.030> downs

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
converting I don't order third downs

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
converting I don't order third downs
where<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> end<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.780> 10<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> 20<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.070> get

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
where do we end up 10 to 20 and we get

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.679 
where do we end up 10 to 20 and we get
to<00:01:35.369> fourth<00:01:35.640> downs<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.390> said<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
to fourth downs out of it said it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.620 
to fourth downs out of it said it
actually<00:01:37.439> were<00:01:37.530> 12<00:01:37.799> 20<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.340> conversions<00:01:38.820> which

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
actually were 12 20 on conversions which

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.950 
actually were 12 20 on conversions which
what's<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.770> sixty<00:01:41.759> percent<00:01:41.960> mathematically

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
what's that sixty percent mathematically

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.149 
what's that sixty percent mathematically
sets<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> decent<00:01:44.009> start<00:01:44.159> force

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
sets you know it's a decent start force

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.209 
sets you know it's a decent start force
first<00:01:47.060> game<00:01:47.240> year<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.020> thought<00:01:48.859> I<00:01:48.920> thought<00:01:49.130> he

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
first game year to thought I thought he

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.410 
first game year to thought I thought he
did<00:01:49.369> real<00:01:49.549> well<00:01:49.579> yeah<00:01:49.969> I<00:01:49.999> think<00:01:50.090> he's<00:01:50.299> gonna

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
did real well yeah I think he's gonna

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.760 
did real well yeah I think he's gonna
have<00:01:50.539> a<00:01:50.569> really<00:01:50.719> good<00:01:50.960> year<00:01:51.140> he's<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.649> lot

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
have a really good year he's a lot

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.109 
have a really good year he's a lot
better<00:01:51.890> than<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.069> lot<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.219> people<00:01:52.310> think<00:01:52.640> he<00:01:52.819> he

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
better than a lot of people think he he

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.969 
better than a lot of people think he he
is<00:01:53.210> he<00:01:53.539> we<00:01:54.079> didn't<00:01:54.259> want<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.439> run<00:01:54.590> him<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.770> bunch

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
is he we didn't want to run him a bunch

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.709 
is he we didn't want to run him a bunch
we<00:01:55.250> didn't<00:01:55.490> we<00:01:55.759> didn't<00:01:55.939> try<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.539> know<00:01:56.569> we

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
we didn't we didn't try to you know we

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.120 
we didn't we didn't try to you know we
try<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.929> keep<00:01:57.109> in<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.350> pocket<00:01:57.770> we've<00:01:57.890> worked

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
try to keep in the pocket we've worked

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.010 
try to keep in the pocket we've worked
on<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.700> think<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.359> saw<00:01:59.569> that<00:01:59.600> he<00:01:59.899> can

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
on that I think you saw that he can

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.510 
on that I think you saw that he can
throw<00:02:00.049> on<00:02:00.200> target<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.979> he's<00:02:01.130> getting<00:02:01.280> better

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
throw on target and he's getting better

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.069 
throw on target and he's getting better
and<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:01.880> think<00:02:01.909> you'll<00:02:02.209> do<00:02:02.390> nothing<00:02:02.539> but<00:02:02.899> get

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
and I think you'll do nothing but get

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.990 
and I think you'll do nothing but get
better<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.590> think<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:03.950> time<00:02:04.189> he<00:02:04.880> has<00:02:04.969> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
better and I think in time he has a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880 
better and I think in time he has a
chance<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.390> be<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.780> quality<00:02:06.170> player<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.740> a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
chance to be a quality player in a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.990 
chance to be a quality player in a
really<00:02:07.099> good<00:02:07.250> quarterback<00:02:07.609> in<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.789> Big<00:02:07.969> Ten

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
really good quarterback in the Big Ten

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.749 
really good quarterback in the Big Ten
and<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:09.200> think<00:02:09.259> he<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.310> think<00:02:10.519> those<00:02:10.610> other

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and I think he and I think those other

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.570 
and I think he and I think those other
two<00:02:11.000> quarterbacks<00:02:11.420> will<00:02:11.629> be<00:02:11.750> capable<00:02:12.230> of

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
two quarterbacks will be capable of

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.680 
two quarterbacks will be capable of
building<00:02:13.580> helping<00:02:14.030> us<00:02:14.150> build<00:02:14.299> this<00:02:14.450> program

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
building helping us build this program

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.100 
building helping us build this program
like<00:02:15.019> we<00:02:15.140> want<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.480> he<00:02:17.480> had<00:02:17.599> one<00:02:17.870> throw<00:02:18.080> I

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
like we want to so he had one throw I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.050 
like we want to so he had one throw I
didn't<00:02:18.379> like<00:02:18.530> where<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.400> knew<00:02:19.579> we<00:02:19.700> had<00:02:19.730> him<00:02:19.849> all

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
didn't like where we knew we had him all

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.000 
didn't like where we knew we had him all
sides<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.569> he<00:02:20.629> was<00:02:20.720> taking<00:02:20.989> an<00:02:21.260> aggressive

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
sides and he was taking an aggressive

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.710 
sides and he was taking an aggressive
throw<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:22.910> he<00:02:22.970> threw<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.180> into<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.390> middle

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
throw but he threw it into the middle

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.089 
throw but he threw it into the middle
and<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.959> go<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.319> if<00:02:24.410> they<00:02:24.590> didn't<00:02:24.829> call<00:02:24.920> him<00:02:25.010> all

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
and I go one if they didn't call him all

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.470 
and I go one if they didn't call him all
sides<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:25.700> too<00:02:25.879> greedy<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.299> play<00:02:26.450> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
sides and it was too greedy and play I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.759 
sides and it was too greedy and play I
wish<00:02:26.810> he<00:02:26.930> would<00:02:27.019> have<00:02:27.079> thrown<00:02:27.260> one<00:02:27.470> outside

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
wish he would have thrown one outside

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.619 
wish he would have thrown one outside
but<00:02:28.010> there<00:02:28.610> wasn't<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.940> lot<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.180> time<00:02:29.390> she

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
but there wasn't a lot of time she

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.819 
but there wasn't a lot of time she
scratched<00:02:29.930> her<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.230> said<00:02:30.379> why<00:02:30.500> don't<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.680> go

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
scratched her and said why don't you go

scratched her and said why don't you go
there<00:02:31.069> he<00:02:31.670> missed<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:32.030> couple<00:02:32.239> he<00:02:33.140> they<00:02:33.680> drop

down on him on that one fourth down call
we<00:02:36.079> didn't<00:02:36.319> get<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.620> boulder<00:02:37.069> don't<00:02:37.970> an<00:02:38.090> out

cut and a guy undercut him and he missed
the<00:02:40.099> throw<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.549> he<00:02:40.640> made<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.819> good<00:02:40.910> miss<00:02:41.299> but<00:02:41.599> it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
the throw and he made a good miss but it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.630 
the throw and he made a good miss but it
was<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:42.560> probably<00:02:42.829> didn't<00:02:43.099> make<00:02:43.190> an<00:02:43.340> ideal

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
was a we probably didn't make an ideal

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.520 
was a we probably didn't make an ideal
call<00:02:43.940> for<00:02:44.180> him<00:02:44.299> but<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:45.079> Trey<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.440> was

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
call for him but I think Trey it was

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.050 
call for him but I think Trey it was
very<00:02:45.709> proud<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.069> way<00:02:46.190> played<00:02:46.489> it's<00:02:46.940> very

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
very proud of the way played it's very

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.819

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
we kind of made it easy we kind of

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.289 
we kind of made it easy we kind of
looped<00:03:18.380> out<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.620> gap<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.160> gave<00:03:19.340> gave<00:03:20.150> the

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.900 
looped out of gap and just gave gave the
guy<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.799> straight<00:03:21.799> line<00:03:21.980> clear<00:03:22.310> pass<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.849> our

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
guy a straight line clear pass and our

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.339 
guy a straight line clear pass and our
safety<00:03:23.120> just<00:03:23.389> kind<00:03:23.599> of<00:03:23.630> misfit<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.169> and<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
safety just kind of misfit it and the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.159 
safety just kind of misfit it and the
guy<00:03:24.440> was<00:03:24.620> gone<00:03:25.569> other<00:03:26.569> than<00:03:26.690> at<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.959> first

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
guy was gone other than at the first

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.050 
guy was gone other than at the first
half<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.709> think<00:03:27.950> they're<00:03:28.099> 15<00:03:28.639> on<00:03:28.880> third

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
half and I think they're 15 on third

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.970 
half and I think they're 15 on third
down<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.419> first<00:03:29.630> half<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.139> other<00:03:30.620> than<00:03:30.889> we

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
down the first half and other than we

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.890 
down the first half and other than we
got<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.220> little<00:03:31.459> soft<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.120> maybe<00:03:32.329> didn't

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
got a little soft and maybe didn't

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.530 
got a little soft and maybe didn't
adjust<00:03:33.169> our<00:03:33.349> coverages<00:03:33.769> but<00:03:34.069> same<00:03:34.819> situation

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
adjust our coverages but same situation

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.000 
adjust our coverages but same situation
at<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> end<00:03:35.989> we<00:03:36.109> were<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.260> little<00:03:36.380> bit<00:03:36.560> better<00:03:36.709> I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
at the end we were a little bit better I

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.740 
at the end we were a little bit better I
didn't<00:03:37.519> like<00:03:37.639> that<00:03:37.760> he'll<00:03:38.060> he'll<00:03:38.540> marry

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
didn't like that he'll he'll marry

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.390 
didn't like that he'll he'll marry
outcall<00:03:39.440> they<00:03:39.620> did<00:03:39.829> because<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.069> knew<00:03:40.280> they

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
outcall they did because you knew they

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.349 
outcall they did because you knew they
were<00:03:40.459> going<00:03:40.609> to<00:03:40.669> call<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:40.880> we<00:03:41.209> actually

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
were going to call that we actually

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.530 
were going to call that we actually
practice<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> wish<00:03:44.269> would<00:03:44.419> have

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
practice that and what a wish would have

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.520 
practice that and what a wish would have
been<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.690> little<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:44.989> all<00:03:45.079> over<00:03:45.109> that<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.470> little

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
been a little bit all over that a little

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.250 
been a little bit all over that a little
bit<00:03:45.680> better<00:03:46.419> our<00:03:47.419> defense<00:03:47.629> needs<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.109> be

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
bit better our defense needs to be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.030 
bit better our defense needs to be
better<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:49.030> think<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.599> know<00:03:50.629> again

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
better but I think they you know again

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.120 
better but I think they you know again
four<00:03:52.040> sacks<00:03:52.310> couple<00:03:52.669> turnovers<00:03:54.039> it's<00:03:55.039> a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
four sacks couple turnovers it's a

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.379 
four sacks couple turnovers it's a
decent<00:03:55.489> start<00:03:55.609> but<00:03:55.729> I'd<00:03:55.910> like<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> see<00:03:56.269> those

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
decent start but I'd like to see those

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.719 
decent start but I'd like to see those
guys<00:03:56.539> continue<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.079> play<00:03:57.199> better<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.650> think

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729 
guys continue to play better and I think

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.890 
guys continue to play better and I think

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
it'll be interesting three four five

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.710 
it'll be interesting three four five
weeks<00:04:22.759> from<00:04:22.820> now<00:04:23.000> as<00:04:23.120> we<00:04:23.240> go<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.419> Northwestern

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.140 
weeks from now as we go to Northwestern
and<00:04:24.110> getting<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.380> Big<00:04:24.500> Ten<00:04:24.530> play<00:04:24.919> how<00:04:25.610> those<00:04:25.820> JC

and getting a Big Ten play how those JC

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.719 
and getting a Big Ten play how those JC
players<00:04:26.570> because<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.229> will<00:04:27.350> really

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
players because I think that will really

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.860 
players because I think that will really
maybe<00:04:28.729> see<00:04:28.940> if<00:04:29.030> our<00:04:29.120> defense<00:04:29.419> can<00:04:29.660> make

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
maybe see if our defense can make

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.719 
maybe see if our defense can make
another<00:04:30.410> step<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.949> thought<00:04:31.100> it's<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> nice<00:04:31.430> start

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
another step I thought it's a nice start

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.060 
another step I thought it's a nice start
thought<00:04:32.240> they<00:04:32.360> did<00:04:32.539> well<00:04:32.720> but<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.620> think<00:04:33.770> with

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
thought they did well but I think with

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.590 
thought they did well but I think with
those<00:04:34.220> junior<00:04:34.550> college<00:04:34.760> linebackers<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.419> a

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
those junior college linebackers and a

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.420 
those junior college linebackers and a
couple<00:04:35.870> guys<00:04:36.020> be<00:04:36.770> interesting<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.160> see<00:04:37.280> where

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
too I mean there's a bunch a bunch of

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.930 
too I mean there's a bunch a bunch of
guys<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.680> play<00:05:06.979> more<00:05:07.190> than<00:05:07.280> one<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:08.539> know

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.089 
guys that play more than one so you know
I<00:05:11.110> think<00:05:12.110> we<00:05:12.169> need<00:05:12.320> more<00:05:12.349> than<00:05:12.500> one<00:05:12.710> back<00:05:12.889> out

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
I think we need more than one back out

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.350 
I think we need more than one back out
if<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.280> might<00:05:13.460> separated<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.060> think<00:05:14.240> they're

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
if you might separated I think they're

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.810 
if you might separated I think they're
all<00:05:14.479> reasonably<00:05:14.900> solid<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:16.039> don't<00:05:16.580> if<00:05:16.639> we<00:05:16.729> have

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
all reasonably solid I don't if we have

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.760 
all reasonably solid I don't if we have
a<00:05:16.849> great<00:05:17.120> player<00:05:17.419> but<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:18.169> think<00:05:18.349> we<00:05:18.440> need<00:05:18.560> them

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
a great player but I think we need them

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.350 
a great player but I think we need them
all<00:05:18.979> right<00:05:19.250> now<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.490> maybe<00:05:19.789> get<00:05:19.970> really<00:05:20.240> good

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
all right now to maybe get really good

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.140 
all right now to maybe get really good
production<00:05:20.900> maybe<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.650> guy's<00:05:21.860> separate<00:05:22.430> even

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
production maybe a guy's separate even

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.189 
production maybe a guy's separate even
if<00:05:23.240> he<00:05:23.330> does<00:05:23.479> I<00:05:23.659> think<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.900> need<00:05:24.020> more<00:05:24.139> than

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
if he does I think you need more than

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.960 
if he does I think you need more than
one<00:05:24.409> running<00:05:24.680> back<00:05:24.710> I<00:05:25.039> think<00:05:25.460> with<00:05:25.550> our<00:05:25.639> style

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
one running back I think with our style

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.520 
one running back I think with our style
throwing<00:05:26.419> how<00:05:26.510> many<00:05:26.630> guys<00:05:26.720> caught<00:05:26.990> passes<00:05:27.409> on

throwing how many guys caught passes on

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.800 
throwing how many guys caught passes on
if<00:05:27.620> they<00:05:27.680> got<00:05:27.710> them<00:05:27.919> all<00:05:27.979> owner<00:05:28.190> how<00:05:28.760> many<00:05:28.940> yeah

if they got them all owner how many yeah

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.939 
if they got them all owner how many yeah

mentioned<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.180> other<00:05:50.240> day<00:05:50.389> we<00:05:50.690> had<00:05:50.720> a<00:05:50.810> depth

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
mentioned the other day we had a depth

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.960 
mentioned the other day we had a depth
chart<00:05:51.409> and<00:05:51.650> that's<00:05:52.250> maybe<00:05:52.460> because<00:05:52.729> it<00:05:52.849> guy

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
chart and that's maybe because it guy

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.490 
chart and that's maybe because it guy
had<00:05:53.120> been<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.270> little<00:05:53.479> bit<00:05:53.630> more<00:05:53.750> consistent<00:05:54.440> or

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
had been a little bit more consistent or

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.960 
had been a little bit more consistent or
a<00:05:54.530> little<00:05:54.680> bit<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.919> two<00:05:55.099> wasn't<00:05:55.430> that<00:05:55.520> bad<00:05:55.699> and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
a little bit the two wasn't that bad and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.339 
a little bit the two wasn't that bad and
we<00:05:56.030> expected<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:56.539> lot<00:05:56.659> of<00:05:56.750> those<00:05:56.810> guys<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:57.169> play

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
we expected a lot of those guys to play

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.260 
we expected a lot of those guys to play
I<00:05:57.380> think<00:05:57.470> you<00:05:57.710> saw<00:05:57.860> that<00:05:58.010> on<00:05:58.130> defense<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.789> think

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
I think you saw that on defense I think

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.640 
I think you saw that on defense I think
you<00:05:59.330> saw<00:05:59.510> that<00:05:59.539> on<00:05:59.750> offense<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.289> don't<00:06:00.440> how<00:06:00.500> many

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
you saw that on offense I don't how many

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.070 
you saw that on offense I don't how many
guys<00:06:00.800> played<00:06:01.130> but<00:06:01.340> it's<00:06:01.970> prob<00:06:02.150> about<00:06:02.210> 35<00:06:02.720> 38

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
guys played but it's prob about 35 38

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.409 
guys played but it's prob about 35 38
guys<00:06:03.349> played<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.710> lot<00:06:04.250> of<00:06:04.400> offense<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:05.000> defense

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
guys played a lot of offense and defense

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.149 
guys played a lot of offense and defense
and<00:06:05.510> I<00:06:05.599> think<00:06:05.900> maybe<00:06:06.500> because<00:06:06.740> our<00:06:06.830> starters

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
and I think maybe because our starters

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.860 
and I think maybe because our starters
aren't<00:06:07.310> great<00:06:07.550> but<00:06:08.120> we<00:06:08.240> do<00:06:08.330> have<00:06:08.419> more<00:06:08.599> depth

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
aren't great but we do have more depth

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.040 
aren't great but we do have more depth
and<00:06:09.219> I<00:06:10.219> think<00:06:11.090> you'll<00:06:11.180> see<00:06:11.330> several<00:06:11.539> receivers

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
and I think you'll see several receivers

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.600 
and I think you'll see several receivers
plane<00:06:12.260> I<00:06:12.289> think<00:06:12.590> you'll<00:06:12.710> see<00:06:12.770> several<00:06:13.099> running

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
plane I think you'll see several running

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.790 
plane I think you'll see several running
Beck's<00:06:13.789> plan<00:06:14.030> and<00:06:14.509> I'd<00:06:15.199> actually<00:06:15.379> like<00:06:15.560> to<00:06:15.620> see

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
Beck's plan and I'd actually like to see

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.959 
Beck's plan and I'd actually like to see
them<00:06:15.919> all<00:06:15.979> play<00:06:16.159> better<00:06:16.400> and<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.729> think<00:06:16.759> the

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:16.969 
them all play better and I think the

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.050 
them all play better and I think the
more<00:06:17.120> we<00:06:17.150> play<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.599> more<00:06:17.719> they<00:06:17.870> will
