00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello to all the viewers of my channel 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.750
 today I would like to show you and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.670
 tell about this u secret rotary 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.940
 which I did a few days ago 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:18.380
 generator for 40 min hertz can issue 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 sine and square wave signals 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.730
 so I found such a generator on one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.119
 from the sites under the video I will give all the links and 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.439
 links also to this site will 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 to know or the generator is very simple 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.290
 made on atmega8 microcontroller and here 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 such a module and 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.399
 9850 this module costs about 7 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 dollars plus comes to him more such 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.430
 screen is very easy to manage 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 controlled with a button encoder 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.070
 yes and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.770
 6 buttons that correspond to the cells 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.860
 memory that is, you can record the frequency 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.070
 on 6 different buttons and quickly 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.810
 switch between frequencies data 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 buttons are not yet completely done as with 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.400
 the author of this scheme, I'm talking now 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.610
 that is, we communicate and plan to do 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.659
 frequency generator + 6 meters that is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.040
 the frequency will be like this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.509
 done and if everything works out 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.450
 be sure to eat it all this scheme and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.299
 show you what happened in the end 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.310
 there is it means that management is only on 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.310
 these 6 buttons and encoder 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.130
 now we have turned to principle see on 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.850
 the screen a hundred times already when you turn off 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.690
 read rate with the first button 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.180
 which is 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.420
 frequency that is clogged for the first time 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 Memory means and rotates frames 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.570
 change the frequency by pressing the button 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.360
 encoder change the frequency shift then 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.750
 here you can for example standing 1 1 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 kilohertz 10 people and ask us the right 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.360
 100 kilohertz purity and 1 billion 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.630
 Well, so here is all very simple 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.850
 Now we will try to connect the wing 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.060
 started up the oscilloscope and see what 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.310
 our generator generates signals 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.830
 one more thing I want to say that I 'm floating in 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.940
 during testing for some reason 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.940
 stopped issuing 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.500
 the square wave stopped 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.480
 but only the sine is here and so is yet 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.190
 one thing I want to say is that sin is that 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.620
 square wave is very affected 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.980
 on the sine and causes interference especially on 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.980
 large frequency here is provided for 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.530
 this circuit off on the display 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.900
 sine and rectangular is displayed 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.700
 a signal can this court latok build 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 build to some purity 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.890
 we have turned off the square wave and 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.040
 thus did not interfere with 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.150
 our sinus teacher and our 100 dollars 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.670
 we turn on the generator itself to the generator 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.360
 see the frequency is worth so that is crammed 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:33.000
 For the first time, we increase the memory cell with the encoder. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.000
 frequency step that is possible 10 kilohertz 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 here 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:59.210
 everything works March 3 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:02.210
 11 miller now we are adjusting 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.210
 adjust 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:12.470
 it means we are adjusting our oscilloscope 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.319
 there is to have good sync in 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.389
 principle, you can throw here and up to 40 and 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:30.230
 hitting it shows very well but 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:35.320
 need to customize now try shoes 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:41.230
 tune in to 15 for 15 mins 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.230
 try to tune in like this 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.150
 but a little hard 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:21.199
 but as you can see 33 megahertz principle up to 40 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:25.219
 the island itself for 50 years to 40 it works 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:28.179
 ok well try 40 see something 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.179
 see that there is no 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:45.640
 it can be seen that there is no well, as if like this 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.640
 that's how it looks like this 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:57.490
 then of course not managed more 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.620
 let's say achieve a clearer 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.880
 sine wave but in principle now for both 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.510
 order to show that everyone is here 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.080
 works 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.550
 I think this is quite enough means like this 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.330
 here guys of course under the video will be 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.610
 link 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.290
 all you need to build this 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.660
 frequency generator 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.450
 I want to say one more thing with the author I 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.410
 I work and now we will try to do 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.440
 oscillator and frequency meters in one package 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.070
 On one display, everything goes well, that is 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.919
 I think for a few weeks 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.470
 will come out already finished who i am schemas principle 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.460
 so good bye guys all bye 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.169
 good luck to all 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.890
