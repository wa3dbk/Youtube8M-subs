the<00:00:20.279> only<00:00:20.609> issue<00:00:21.210> I've<00:00:21.600> run<00:00:21.869> into<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the only issue I've run into though is

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.130 
the only issue I've run into though is
that<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.699> interface<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:24.390> weird<00:00:24.750> so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that the interface is really weird so

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
that the interface is really weird so
for<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.560> your<00:00:25.920> HUD<00:00:26.099> scale<00:00:26.490> needs<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.240> be

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
for one your HUD scale needs to be

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.269 
for one your HUD scale needs to be
basically<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> way<00:00:28.800> down<00:00:29.039> which<00:00:29.250> you

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
basically all the way down which you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.970 
basically all the way down which you
find<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.730> game<00:00:29.910> settings<00:00:30.179> under<00:00:30.720> options<00:00:31.140> but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
find in game settings under options but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
find in game settings under options but
from<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.640> HUD<00:00:32.850> especially<00:00:33.510> in

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
from there the HUD especially in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.319 
from there the HUD especially in
deathmatch<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.290> still<00:00:34.739> pretty<00:00:35.670> big<00:00:35.880> pretty

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you basically get it to the point where

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
you basically get it to the point where
it's<00:00:41.640> perfect<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.390> where<00:00:42.570> it'll<00:00:43.140> fit<00:00:43.530> most

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
amounts of modifications through the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.670 
amounts of modifications through the
console<00:00:49.579> basically<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> config<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.680> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
console basically a config and the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610

config that you would need for this is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
config that you would need for this is
extremely<00:00:56.100> complicated<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.300> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
extremely complicated so much so that I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
extremely complicated so much so that I
didn't<00:00:57.840> even<00:00:57.960> bother<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.590> um<00:00:59.000> but<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> will

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
didn't even bother with it um but I will

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
didn't even bother with it um but I will
leave<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.809> link<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> forum<00:01:01.920> post<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.640> you

leave a link to a forum post where you
guys<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.510> information<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
guys can get some information on it and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
guys can get some information on it and
if<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> doesn't<00:01:04.890> help<00:01:05.129> I'll<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.970> google

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
if that doesn't help I'll just google

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
if that doesn't help I'll just google
the<00:01:06.479> information<00:01:07.080> figure<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> commands

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the information figure out the commands

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.460 
the information figure out the commands
and<00:01:08.220> eventually<00:01:08.610> you'll<00:01:09.180> figure<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and eventually you'll figure it out it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.230 
and eventually you'll figure it out it's
just<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:10.950> complicated<00:01:11.340> process<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.150> be

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just a very complicated process to be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.700 
just a very complicated process to be
honest<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.990> didn't<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> deal<00:01:13.560> with

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
honest I really didn't want to deal with

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.530 
honest I really didn't want to deal with
it<00:01:13.799> um<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.330> it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it um and I really don't think it's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
it um and I really don't think it's
worth<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.320> think<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.830> um<00:01:17.100> dealing

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
worth it I don't think that um dealing

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
worth it I don't think that um dealing
with<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.570> worth<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
with all that is worth it because as is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.630 
with all that is worth it because as is
it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.729> playable<00:01:21.299> um<00:01:21.979> deathmatch<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.490> get

it is playable um deathmatch you do get

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
it is playable um deathmatch you do get
a<00:01:23.670> massive<00:01:24.000> HUD<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> top<00:01:24.840> ah<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.799> in

a massive HUD on top ah but in
competitive<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.960> actually<00:01:28.470> much

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

considering viewing this I think it's a

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.170 
considering viewing this I think it's a
great<00:03:36.720> consideration<00:03:37.470> now<00:03:37.859> in<00:03:38.130> terms<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.970> um

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
great consideration now in terms of um

advantages to this is this hacking is
this<00:03:44.579> cheating<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.359> some<00:03:45.600> way<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.049> actually

looked into this and apparently valve

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.830 
looked into this and apparently valve
has<00:03:49.170> no<00:03:49.380> policy<00:03:49.889> against<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.670> nor<00:03:51.630> does

negative about it I don't see any reason

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.000 
negative about it I don't see any reason
you<00:04:06.660> get<00:04:06.810> vac<00:04:07.109> banned<00:04:07.440> or<00:04:07.620> anything<00:04:07.769> like<00:04:07.950> that

you get vac banned or anything like that
it<00:04:08.459> looks<00:04:08.700> pretty<00:04:09.079> good<00:04:10.079> so<00:04:10.850> with<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.000> being

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
it looks pretty good so with that being

it looks pretty good so with that being
said<00:04:12.920> what<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:13.950> recommend<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.489> do<00:04:14.609> this<00:04:14.760> if<00:04:15.030> you

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
said what I recommend you do this if you

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.840 
said what I recommend you do this if you
have<00:04:15.239> csgo<00:04:15.750> yes<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.799> would

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
have csgo yes I would

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.920 
have csgo yes I would
is<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.299> easy<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.750> do<00:04:18.930> yesterday

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
is it easy to do yesterday

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.170 
is it easy to do yesterday
it's<00:04:20.680> really<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.220> know<00:04:21.250> just<00:04:21.579> pop<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:22.030> in

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
it's really you know just pop it in

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's really you know just pop it in
you're<00:04:22.389> ready<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.660> go<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.050> mean<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.889> literally

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
you're ready to go I mean you literally

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.860 
you're ready to go I mean you literally
just<00:04:24.370> set<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:24.610> your<00:04:24.639> monitors<00:04:25.150> get<00:04:25.419> SLI

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
just set up your monitors get SLI

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.150 
just set up your monitors get SLI
surround<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:27.009> and<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:28.120> runs<00:04:28.330> fine<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.160> would

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
surround going and it runs fine I would

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.010 
surround going and it runs fine I would
recommend<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.699> course<00:04:30.880> reducing<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.479> HUD<00:04:31.690> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
recommend of course reducing the HUD and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.779 
recommend of course reducing the HUD and
if<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.530> want<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.770> fine-tune<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.310> more<00:04:33.520> than<00:04:33.699> it

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
if you want to fine-tune it more than it

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.760 
if you want to fine-tune it more than it
gets<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.000> little<00:04:34.060> difficult<00:04:34.300> but<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.169> think<00:04:35.470> the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
gets a little difficult but I think the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.770 
gets a little difficult but I think the
HUD<00:04:35.949> alone<00:04:36.250> does<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.910> job<00:04:37.090> now<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.389> can<00:04:37.630> see

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
HUD alone does the job now you can see

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.200 
HUD alone does the job now you can see
on<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.960> left<00:04:38.139> there<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.530> mini-map<00:04:39.280> is<00:04:39.520> huge

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
on the left there the mini-map is huge

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.749 
on the left there the mini-map is huge
for<00:04:40.750> one<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.199> for<00:04:41.229> two<00:04:42.039> it's<00:04:42.220> far<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.729> left

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
for one and for two it's far to the left

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.629 
for one and for two it's far to the left
now<00:04:43.120> there's<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.389> way<00:04:43.509> to<00:04:43.539> reposition<00:04:44.169> it<00:04:44.639> once

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
now there's a way to reposition it once

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.870 
now there's a way to reposition it once
again<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.060> involves<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:47.560> know<00:04:47.610> going<00:04:48.610> into

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
again that involves you know going into

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.050 
again that involves you know going into
your<00:04:49.060> console<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.199> messing<00:04:50.500> with<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.800> um<00:04:51.060> but

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
your console and messing with it um but

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.750 
your console and messing with it um but
yeah<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.300> HUD<00:04:52.479> is<00:04:52.510> way<00:04:53.289> over<00:04:53.650> there<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.100> that's

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
yeah the HUD is way over there so that's

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.610 
yeah the HUD is way over there so that's
something<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.330> that's<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.840> only<00:04:55.870> downside

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
something that that's the only downside

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.850 
something that that's the only downside
to<00:04:56.650> not<00:04:57.220> messing<00:04:57.789> with<00:04:57.820> your<00:04:58.030> console<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:59.650> it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
to not messing with your console so it

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.950 
to not messing with your console so it
is<00:05:00.000> probably<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.060> good<00:05:01.150> idea<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.449> consider<00:05:01.720> that

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
is probably a good idea to consider that

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.270 
is probably a good idea to consider that
especially<00:05:02.350> if<00:05:02.410> you're<00:05:02.500> playing<00:05:02.740> competitive

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
