00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.300
 of the brothers consoles 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.890
 these new good guys and we have 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.239
 first impressions first departure 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.870
 how do you want called the counter strike 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.360
 global offensive is worth a few guys say 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.940
 that describes it yesterday I downloaded myself already 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.760
 very late this morning I have already put 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.320
 play ok we will be 11 fly with the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.470
 bots that I think this is the typical 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.260
 of all life is to say that I in my 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.229
 a long time ago I played pretty 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.850
 at 1.6 I started and well pretty much I know 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.580
 handle me a little bit that this is not 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.760
 new to me but just in case some 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.810
 of you what you have not seen and want 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.120
 know more about this game that I bring you 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 a small first analysis 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.250
 prints, you owe the modality of 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.799
 I play a little bit everything is worth a lot to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.310
 remind you that if you do not see if you want 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.750
 like the game and you have a team is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.260
 100% recommended for the price that is 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.660
 for only 1200 microsoft points 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.810
 what you see here what would be equivalent to 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.670
 about 15 dollars about 15 euros but 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 website we can find 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.580
 much cheaper we can have access to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.050
 this game is worth counter strike global 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.130
 offensive for on youtube is giving 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.070
 much channel of this game because the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.250
 truth is a real great game as you see 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.920
 I'm in one of these dinners is how 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.260
 we left are the dances I have not put 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.050
 a lot of difficulty since it was the first 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.880
 Once I played a valera 1 new 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.380
 first times more participants because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.150
 I wanted to practice a bit to see how I was going 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.429
 It's worth as you have seen the menu of the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.619
 purchase of touch goes is like a search and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.010
 destroy the call of duty is worth so 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.810
 you know 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.549
 the thing is divided into two camps 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.230
 terrorists and anti terrorists what 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.269
 it means thieves and cops worth 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.310
 talking like this to have the clearest 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.519
 thieves and policemen me here for example 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.500
 are the cops and it works for me is that 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.670
 the thieves do not activate the bomb as 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.280
 you see here they just activated the bomb 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.260
 puts a nation in mind the bomb 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 I already have to go and deactivate the pump if 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.110
 I want to win this round and since they are in 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.110
 the headset has everything 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:45.310
 its function is to activate the pump what 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.950
 this is also the knife goes from 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.659
 ordinary knife of adult passing 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.190
 was little of life or is the function of 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.920
 how they have placed the oil pump 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.489
 deactivate the pump as I approach 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.359
 mickey here and even ninja rifle and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.790
 deactivated the pump worth that's what 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.650
 what we are going to treat us this active 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.139
 defusing bombs are more games 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.670
 they play here in call of duty is worth in 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.829
 the cart and forgive counter-strike 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.170
 As you can see, this is the menu they are going to 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.970
 purchase menu as you have seen it 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.849
 we give aek and there we have all kinds of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.970
 weapons at the beginning of each round we have 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.120
 about five seconds worth five or 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.000
 six seconds to buy things the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.500
 money as you see we are winning 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 pass round win rules rounds 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.489
 or how many more more we have more money 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.709
 dan and that do next round we're going to 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.019
 be able to carry a larger arsenal that is 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.410
 the enemies is worth it because we carry like 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.910
 an advantage we have won 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.480
 and they have lost that you win you give more 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.129
 dollars more money so to speak 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.310
 I have a lot of how they see the gameplay is 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.169
 almost everything from the race just some 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.579
 souls have mira I think it's the needle 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.069
 the snipers and little else the truth 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.480
 the needle talking about the police side 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.970
 means that each side has some 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.409
 weapons that the other does not have is to say yes 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.180
 your police things you will have for 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.909
 example the police woods the m4 is worth 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.680
 the m4a1 the carbine like everything always 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:15.400
 has known is going to be unique of the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.709
 police and ya kalashnikov ak-47 is going to be 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.560
 of thieves is worth it so that only 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.100
 let's see if we are thieves 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.880
 everything goes in a circle and you give it 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.900
 to take the level so that the level is 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.120
 one of the weapons he has spoken about 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.430
 that you have in view as you see here there are two 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.050
 justice times and nothing looks worth as 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.940
 well I'm very bad anime there are also 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.400
 what to say but for what good is that 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.750
 there are weapons with looks like the sniper 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.650
 this may be the one the wb 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.080
 like the l 96 of call of duty 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.000
 I still do not know very well if there is a part 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.889
 quite good level but it happens that one 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.189
 it came out 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:00.479
 a guide will kill me attentively wrong if I 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:03.479
 kill if they kill me now the bastard gets on 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.129
 14 this is a decision of a muse 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.229
 then for example see a bot and 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.279
 control the ball to kill you for 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.110
 not have to wait for your team 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.849
 I ended up you have seen 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.180
 against the boat and then here was what 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.499
 that killed me and it's worth it and you kill it 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.060
 one of the new ones that have 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.710
 implemented in this cocktail are you worth 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.870
 that you do not have to wait for the round 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.490
 it's over you can directly control 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.889
 a bot that is already in play is worth and 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.560
 then in that way they are made to us 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.360
 less boring one as you see if you are 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.669
 seeing that the votes are very bad is 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.650
 that the truth that I expressed it I think that 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.139
 easy or medium I do not know how I put it for 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.580
 to see more or less like the 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.939
 game see here now let's buy 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.830
 magic weapons opens the antwerp menu min 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.280
 for example submachine guns and let's use 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.780
 now the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.130
 p 90 I wanted to try more common weapons 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.360
 of these guys the graphics pretty 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.090
 improved with respect to counter strike 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.070
 last is worth an authentic novelty that 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.720
 have not brought them to xbox to this 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.110
 game has always been exclusive to pc 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.880
 It has never been good to wait no no no 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.650
 I'm going to forget what I said no 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.870
 I know if he came out with complete is 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.280
 for teams I think I remember yes but 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.020
 I at least I always played 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.050
 I started and most people always 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.930
 to this game without basic pc 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.620
 are worth of xbox will be more to play with 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.330
 xbox people 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.190
 to the difference that you buy for 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.169
 playstation okay then it has not come out 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.210
 has been delayed in the market for pc already 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.440
 we have it available because they are diaz 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.900
 euros 10 dollars 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.240
 if you buy it in playstation3 when 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.930
 go out you will have crossfire with the 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.820
 PC that means it will be very 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.640
 difficult for pc people are always the 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.370
 Cracks points are very good when they 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.680
 I started is not the same with a mouse that 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.290
 with a command is worth the thing changes a lot 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.310
 those of fish have always been much 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.290
 top 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.810
 for example , PC marmoset there are many more 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.090
 levels I think that in console because it's 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.890
 much easier for me to be with a 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.820
 mouse that with a joystick control 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.640
 although one makes a decade custom 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.560
 if you can secure a team then 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.020
 those for me so I have not 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.780
 bought for playstation3 and if you have 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.880
 bought for xbox plus three games yo 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.550
 I've always been a fan of this saga 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.920
 of counter strike and guys that more 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.020

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.529

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.389
