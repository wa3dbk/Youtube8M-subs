any great musician knows the number

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.569 
any great musician knows the number
system<00:00:35.660> whether<00:00:36.590> they<00:00:36.829> use<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:37.190> in<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.340> same

I<00:00:40.850> think<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.989> numbering<00:00:42.320> system<00:00:42.530> is<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.980> best

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
I think the numbering system is the best

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.790 
I think the numbering system is the best
way<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.400> play<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:44.329> guitar<00:00:45.110> or<00:00:45.140> any<00:00:45.530> instrument

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
way to play a guitar or any instrument

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.800 
way to play a guitar or any instrument
for<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.280> matter<00:00:47.739> it's<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.860> fastest<00:00:49.400> way

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
for that matter it's the fastest way

what<00:00:50.810> is<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.050> numbering<00:00:51.350> system<00:00:51.530> while<00:00:51.890> it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
what is the numbering system while it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.139 
what is the numbering system while it
relates<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.790> notes<00:00:52.970> in<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.239> scale<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.640> it

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
relates to the notes in the scale and it

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.450 
relates to the notes in the scale and it
relates<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.690> chords<00:00:57.170> or<00:00:57.440> single<00:00:57.920> notes<00:00:58.130> or

relates it to chords or single notes or
both<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:59.530> have<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.899> it's<00:01:02.899> usually<00:01:03.079> written<00:01:03.440> in

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
both you have so it's usually written in

into<00:01:24.170> place<00:01:24.409> for<00:01:24.799> example<00:01:24.909> we'll<00:01:25.909> take<00:01:26.090> an

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
into place for example we'll take an

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.120 
into place for example we'll take an
easy<00:01:26.479> key<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.170> key<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.470> g-major<00:01:27.710> and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
easy key like the key of g-major and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.789 
easy key like the key of g-major and
we'll<00:01:28.220> just<00:01:28.369> take<00:01:28.640> one<00:01:29.360> octave<00:01:29.869> now<00:01:30.590> if<00:01:30.710> you

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
we'll just take one octave now if you

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.960 
we'll just take one octave now if you
don't<00:01:31.010> know<00:01:31.570> much<00:01:32.570> about<00:01:32.650> music<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:34.670> might

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
don't know much about music this might

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.550 
don't know much about music this might
go<00:01:35.180> over<00:01:35.270> your<00:01:35.420> head<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.600> little<00:01:35.750> bit<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.140> can

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
go over your head a little bit I can

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.800 
go over your head a little bit I can
tell<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.010> much<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.850> full<00:01:38.180> scale<00:01:38.540> is

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
tell you this much that a full scale is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.640 
tell you this much that a full scale is
seven<00:01:39.170> notes<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:41.180> any<00:01:41.479> full<00:01:42.110> scale<00:01:42.439> has

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
seven notes and that any full scale has

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.730 
seven notes and that any full scale has
to<00:01:42.799> contain<00:01:43.100> one<00:01:43.400> letter<00:01:43.729> name<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.210> each<00:01:44.659> of

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
to contain one letter name of each of

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.490 
to contain one letter name of each of
the<00:01:45.740> scale<00:01:46.360> notes<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:47.960> we<00:01:48.110> only<00:01:48.290> have

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
the scale notes in it and we only have

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.039 
the scale notes in it and we only have
seven<00:01:48.950> notes<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.400> our<00:01:49.580> musical<00:01:50.060> system<00:01:50.270> so

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
seven notes in our musical system so

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.670 
seven notes in our musical system so
each<00:01:51.530> scale<00:01:52.070> complete<00:01:52.610> scale<00:01:52.970> must<00:01:53.680> contain

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
each scale complete scale must contain

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.940 
each scale complete scale must contain
the<00:01:55.009> seven<00:01:55.790> basic<00:01:56.240> letters<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:57.350> be<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.500> complete

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
the seven basic letters to be a complete

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.640 
the seven basic letters to be a complete
scale<00:01:58.340> or<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:59.360> course<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.900> total<00:02:00.200> botch<00:02:00.409> up

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
scale or of course it's a total botch up

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.100 
scale or of course it's a total botch up
and<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:00.920> much<00:02:01.220> harder<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.729> course<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.540> write

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
and it's much harder of course to write

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.340 
and it's much harder of course to write
written<00:02:03.530> notation<00:02:03.970> if<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.210> have<00:02:05.420> letter

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
written notation if you have letter

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.990 
written notation if you have letter
names<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.950> are<00:02:07.070> repeating<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:07.670> aren't

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
names that are repeating but aren't

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.369 
names that are repeating but aren't
actually<00:02:08.149> different<00:02:08.599> notes<00:02:08.840> meaning<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:09.349> a

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
actually different notes meaning like a

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.530 
actually different notes meaning like a
a<00:02:10.189> G<00:02:11.090> sharp<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.599> an<00:02:11.689> A<00:02:11.810> flat<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.650> know<00:02:13.540> will

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
a G sharp and an A flat you know will

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.059 
a G sharp and an A flat you know will
won't<00:02:14.750> worry<00:02:14.930> about<00:02:15.019> that<00:02:15.230> today<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:15.829> that<00:02:15.950> is

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
won't worry about that today but that is

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.640 
won't worry about that today but that is
another<00:02:16.340> lesson<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.879> itself<00:02:17.110> today<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.260> about

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
another lesson in itself today is about

now for each note in the scale we have a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.449 
now for each note in the scale we have a
chord<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:57.049> three<00:02:57.650> majors<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.220> three

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
chord we have three majors and three

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.630 
chord we have three majors and three
minors<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.650> they're<00:03:00.650> contained<00:03:01.130> all<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.519> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.839 
minors and they're contained all in the
scale<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:02.959> example<00:03:02.989> one<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:03.829> major<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.700> is

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
scale for example one is major to is

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.680 
scale for example one is major to is
minor<00:03:05.150> three<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:05.959> minor<00:03:06.260> forests<00:03:07.160> major<00:03:07.690> -

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
minor three is minor forests major -

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.699 
minor three is minor forests major -
major<00:03:08.930> sixth<00:03:09.709> minor<00:03:09.980> seven<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.640> diminished

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
major sixth minor seven is diminished

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.020 
major sixth minor seven is diminished
eight<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:12.980> octave

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
eight is the octave

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.880 
eight is the octave
so<00:03:16.030> now<00:03:16.269> if<00:03:16.629> somebody<00:03:16.989> says<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.470> okay<00:03:17.739> it's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
so now if somebody says to you okay it's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.479 
so now if somebody says to you okay it's

that's major minor minor major major
minor<00:03:49.030> 6<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.170> minor

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
minor 6 is minor

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.319 
minor 6 is minor
so<00:03:52.299> that's<00:03:52.510> C<00:03:52.720> minor<00:03:53.310> because<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.459> g<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.640> b<00:03:54.790> c<00:03:55.060> d

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
so that's C minor because it's g a b c d

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.539 
so that's C minor because it's g a b c d
e<00:03:56.129> 6<00:03:57.129> chord<00:03:57.879> is<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.299> minor<00:03:58.650> based<00:03:59.650> on<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.099> e<00:04:00.129> root

here's another interesting chord
progression

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.830 

that's<00:05:51.210> G<00:05:51.569> major<00:05:52.400> B<00:05:53.400> minor

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
that's G major B minor

well she is one B minor is three

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.230 
well she is one B minor is three
is<00:06:02.900> for<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:03.740> she<00:06:03.919> is<00:06:04.070> 1<00:06:04.340> so<00:06:04.699> this<00:06:04.850> progression

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
is for and she is 1 so this progression

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.560 
is for and she is 1 so this progression
is<00:06:05.510> a<00:06:05.630> 1<00:06:06.639> 3

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
is a 1 3

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.180 
is a 1 3
for<00:06:09.110> at<00:06:10.010> one

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
for at one

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.700 
for at one
and<00:06:13.190> this<00:06:14.060> applies<00:06:14.630> to<00:06:14.660> any<00:06:15.080> key

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
and this applies to any key

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.439 
and this applies to any key
I<00:06:15.740> just<00:06:16.160> took<00:06:16.340> g-major<00:06:16.759> because<00:06:17.030> it's<00:06:17.180> an<00:06:17.300> easy

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
I just took g-major because it's an easy

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.060 
I just took g-major because it's an easy
key<00:06:17.720> and<00:06:17.870> everybody<00:06:18.229> kind<00:06:18.440> of<00:06:18.560> knows<00:06:18.710> that<00:06:18.919> and

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
key and everybody kind of knows that and

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.969 
key and everybody kind of knows that and
it's<00:06:19.190> a<00:06:19.250> good<00:06:19.400> place<00:06:19.639> to<00:06:19.669> start<00:06:20.090> from<00:06:20.800> so<00:06:21.800> if

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
it's a good place to start from so if

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.040 
it's a good place to start from so if
you<00:06:22.100> can<00:06:22.250> remember<00:06:22.580> that<00:06:22.850> each<00:06:23.120> note<00:06:23.750> in<00:06:24.020> your

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
you can remember that each note in your

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.980 
you can remember that each note in your
7<00:06:24.620> note<00:06:24.800> scale<00:06:24.830> that's<00:06:25.460> the<00:06:25.639> diatonic<00:06:26.300> scale<00:06:26.539> 7

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
7 note scale that's the diatonic scale 7

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.600 
7 note scale that's the diatonic scale 7
die<00:06:27.229> and<00:06:27.440> meaning<00:06:27.740> 7<00:06:28.160> 1<00:06:28.880> 2<00:06:28.910> 3<00:06:29.300> 4<00:06:29.630> 5<00:06:29.810> 6<00:06:30.169> 7<00:06:30.320> 8<00:06:30.680> is

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
you're talking about a quarter scale at

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.150 
you're talking about a quarter scale at
that<00:07:12.090> point<00:07:12.419> when<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.500> numbers<00:07:13.830> relate
