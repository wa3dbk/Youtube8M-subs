a famous permaculture teacher once said
permaculture<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:10.030> all<00:00:10.540> about<00:00:10.900> a<00:00:11.200> networks<00:00:12.130> of

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
permaculture is all about a networks of

language<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.350> really<00:01:08.619> nice<00:01:08.799> at<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
language is really nice at the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.429 
language is really nice at the
permaculture<00:01:09.430> but<00:01:09.729> let<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.909> speak<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.270> that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
permaculture but let you speak to that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.020 
permaculture but let you speak to that
well<00:01:11.439> in<00:01:11.650> bill<00:01:12.689> Moulson<00:01:13.720> was<00:01:14.520> his<00:01:15.520> whole<00:01:15.790> focus

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
well in bill Moulson was his whole focus

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.340 
well in bill Moulson was his whole focus
is<00:01:16.330> kind<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.720> if<00:01:16.840> you're<00:01:17.020> in<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.200> real

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
is kind of like if you're in the real

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.620 
is kind of like if you're in the real
estate<00:01:17.530> business<00:01:17.770> its<00:01:18.369> location<00:01:19.030> location

location<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:20.500> heard<00:01:20.650> that<00:01:20.680> expression<00:01:21.570> when

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
location you heard that expression when

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.570 
location you heard that expression when
permaculture<00:01:23.229> it's<00:01:23.380> all<00:01:23.500> about<00:01:23.710> observation

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
permaculture it's all about observation

permaculture it's all about observation
observation<00:01:25.229> observation<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.409> the

observation observation and the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.920 
observation observation and the
difference<00:01:27.430> between<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.850> good<00:01:28.060> farmer<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.840> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
farmer who's struggling is observation

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.170 
farmer who's struggling is observation
observing<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.829> pattern<00:01:33.310> seeing<00:01:33.850> what's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
observing a pattern seeing what's

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.590 
observing a pattern seeing what's
happening<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.210> skills<00:01:38.159> basically

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
happening and the skills basically

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.749 
happening and the skills basically
whether<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.900> know<00:01:41.140> anything<00:01:41.860> we<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.310> take

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
whether you know anything we just take

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.609 
whether you know anything we just take
about<00:01:43.000> all<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.479> knowledge<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:44.110> fact<00:01:44.439> that

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
about all that knowledge the fact that

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.830 
about all that knowledge the fact that
you've<00:01:44.829> gone<00:01:45.070> through<00:01:45.400> this<00:01:45.549> exercise<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
you've gone through this exercise and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.950 
you've gone through this exercise and
you're<00:01:47.170> now<00:01:47.439> aware<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:49.119> can<00:01:49.360> see<00:01:49.600> patterns

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you're now aware and can see patterns

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.679 
you're now aware and can see patterns
and<00:01:50.530> don't<00:01:51.220> even<00:01:51.520> pay<00:01:51.759> any<00:01:51.939> attention<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.570> a

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
and don't even pay any attention to a

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.450 
and don't even pay any attention to a
bird<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.110> rest<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.409> your<00:01:53.530> life<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:54.220> fact

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
bird in the rest of your life the fact

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.910 
bird in the rest of your life the fact
is<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.820> bring<00:01:55.180> those<00:01:55.420> skills<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.860> you

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
is you can bring those skills when you

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.969 
is you can bring those skills when you
start<00:01:57.369> doing<00:01:57.549> permaculture<00:01:58.210> design<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.740> it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
start doing permaculture design so it's

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.850 
start doing permaculture design so it's
really<00:02:00.219> its<00:02:00.880> knowledge<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:02.170> what's<00:02:02.409> going<00:02:02.710> on

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
really its knowledge of what's going on

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.530 
really its knowledge of what's going on
what<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.280> hummingbirds<00:02:03.729> are<00:02:03.880> doing<00:02:04.180> but<00:02:04.390> it's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
what the hummingbirds are doing but it's

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.630 
what the hummingbirds are doing but it's
really<00:02:04.750> setting<00:02:05.079> up<00:02:05.290> those<00:02:05.469> mind<00:02:05.799> patterns<00:02:06.369> of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
really setting up those mind patterns of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.180 
really setting up those mind patterns of
being<00:02:06.939> able<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.329> be<00:02:08.200> aware<00:02:08.320> of<00:02:08.590> everything

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
being able to be aware of everything

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.080 
being able to be aware of everything
that's<00:02:09.310> going

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
that's going

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.020 
that's going
it's<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.240> great<00:02:11.630> question<00:02:12.200> because<00:02:12.790> one<00:02:13.790> would

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it's a great question because one would

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.780 
it's a great question because one would
ask<00:02:14.270> why<00:02:14.750> why<00:02:15.440> were<00:02:15.620> people<00:02:16.250> who<00:02:16.400> are<00:02:16.550> just

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
ask why why were people who are just

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.780 
ask why why were people who are just
doing<00:02:17.000> permaculture<00:02:17.930> wanna<00:02:18.650> join<00:02:19.100> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
doing permaculture wanna join the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.850 
doing permaculture wanna join the
wilderness<00:02:20.300> awareness<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.140> put<00:02:21.320> those<00:02:21.500> two

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
wilderness awareness and put those two

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.590 
wilderness awareness and put those two
disciplines<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.910> those<00:02:23.030> two<00:02:23.240> schools

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
disciplines and those two schools

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.350 
disciplines and those two schools
together<00:02:23.900> into<00:02:24.620> one<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.790> because<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
together into one and it's because the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.200 
together into one and it's because the
depth<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:28.040> being<00:02:28.340> able<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.790> do<00:02:29.180> a
