00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
the burning sensation through my whole

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.620 
the burning sensation through my whole
body<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:31.230> just<00:04:32.450> excruciating<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:34.530> hey<00:04:35.630> well

done<00:04:36.930> boys<00:04:37.260> with<00:04:37.950> brute<00:04:38.250> force<00:04:38.280> they<00:04:39.060> bent<00:04:39.390> the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
done boys with brute force they bent the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.520 
done boys with brute force they bent the
forks<00:04:39.960> right<00:04:40.350> back<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.350> a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
forks right back in so I think it's a

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.290 
forks right back in so I think it's a
bit<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.890> half<00:04:44.070> jobs<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:44.700> hopefully<00:04:45.210> it

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
bit of a half jobs that hopefully it

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.900 
bit of a half jobs that hopefully it
gets<00:04:45.480> me<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.440> NTM<00:04:47.340> which<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.730> capital

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
gets me to the NTM which is the capital

thank you for taking care of me I've

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.250 
thank you for taking care of me I've
been<00:06:42.410> thinking<00:06:42.710> you<00:06:43.550> know<00:06:43.640> why<00:06:43.990> why<00:06:44.990> did<00:06:45.050> I

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
been thinking you know why why did I

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.960 
been thinking you know why why did I
have<00:06:45.530> that<00:06:45.880> really<00:06:46.880> painful<00:06:47.300> accident<00:06:48.970> first

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
have that really painful accident first

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.910 
have that really painful accident first
I<00:06:50.240> thought<00:06:50.510> maybe<00:06:50.840> you<00:06:51.290> know<00:06:51.410> it's<00:06:51.560> a<00:06:51.620> sign<00:06:51.890> I

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
I thought maybe you know it's a sign I

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.610 
I thought maybe you know it's a sign I
should<00:06:52.370> be<00:06:52.520> checking<00:06:52.820> my<00:06:53.030> bike<00:06:53.870> mechanics<00:06:54.470> a

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
should be checking my bike mechanics a

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.280 
should be checking my bike mechanics a
bit<00:06:54.800> more<00:06:54.950> regularly<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.990> then<00:06:57.140> I<00:06:57.170> thought

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
bit more regularly and then I thought

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.950 
bit more regularly and then I thought
well<00:06:57.740> maybe<00:06:57.800> I<00:06:58.430> was<00:06:58.940> supposed<00:06:59.300> to<00:06:59.540> have<00:06:59.750> that

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
well maybe I was supposed to have that

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.490 
well maybe I was supposed to have that
amazing<00:07:00.970> time<00:07:01.970> of<00:07:02.000> the<00:07:02.330> villages<00:07:02.810> where<00:07:03.440> they

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
amazing time of the villages where they

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.000 
amazing time of the villages where they
took<00:07:03.860> me<00:07:04.040> in<00:07:04.190> I<00:07:05.440> thought<00:07:06.440> even<00:07:06.620> more

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
took me in I thought even more

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.540 
took me in I thought even more
importantly<00:07:07.840> but<00:07:08.840> maybe<00:07:09.110> if<00:07:09.710> I<00:07:09.830> get<00:07:10.160> one

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
importantly but maybe if I get one

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.100 
importantly but maybe if I get one
donation<00:07:11.830> from<00:07:12.830> this
