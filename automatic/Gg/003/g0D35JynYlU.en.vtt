00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.519
 0 1 lost or 10 last one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.170
 lost in this one in the last one 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.040
 exciting cup playing straight in the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 last minutes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
 it was a lot of interruptions 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.220
 difficult game for your team 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.650
 rather difficult game we were not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 clearly the better team and have it 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 failed to make the gates and then 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.369
 there have straussed me the last 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 minute with the gate but I'm only 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.140
 everything is satisfied with mine 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.059
 team with the performance and after 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.500
 look ahead 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.120
 now they have stretched the distance 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 second half with a man more 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 felt what last last single 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 made a difference why could theirs 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 Team this number in the square 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 do not convert to gates 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 yes we were in the middle of the game 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.360
 feel little click of your game 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 We do not have to do it and we did not do it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.840
 have this experience and wonderful 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.619
 Thanks Pass traveled but thanks to the end 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.869
 now you were indeed fully involved 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.100
 without a fight in the square many of the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.140
 spectators in the evening and hope for one 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.590
 extension set just yes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.659
 scarcely comes to but now comes to 88 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.909
 minute what happened to you at the moment he did 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 the ball in front of the hardest through the head 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.930
 and how relieved it is him 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.979
 actually a stronger opponent one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.659
 round to get ahead 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 So of course I'm relieved 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.840
 I saw the ball and thought I must 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.610
 not just next door to him 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 not there I met him 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.790
 then happiness is so went in and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 I found so now she is actually 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.040
 no stronger opponent so today were 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.869
 the better than here 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.720
 but I think otherwise we are the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.950
 better team but today they were 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.329
 a bit more aggressive and poisonous 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.100
 just at the beginning of the game has me 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.659
 We had already noticed how it felt 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.340
 Renters got thanks to the bread 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.570
 But I think we will be whole 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.890
 well done and of course luck 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 So they had won 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.390
 I'm deserving today but I would have 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.970
 a bit of luck and then almost 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.880
 everything 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.150
 a question on the page in half again 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.430
 the quarterfinal cl-finale very clear 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.990
 na So a goal of course is always 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.730
 a round further to come so the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.560
 least of us played on tv poker 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.060
 May of course is such a small dream 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.860
 to come to a conclusion and then of course 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.330
 to win but I guess we 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.140
 have to look from round to round and 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140
 then everything fits
