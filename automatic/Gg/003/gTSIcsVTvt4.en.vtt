 today I bring you a very tutorial 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.669
 small how to be a cat and that we 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.860
 stay perfect and not die in the attempt 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.560
 to do it we are going to do it in two ways 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.380
 the first base with an eyeliner in that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.300
 like this and an angle type brush 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.040
 the eye the second way we're going to 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.170
 to do is to sing today is going to be 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.570
 by with liquid eyeliner like this one and 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.599
 scotch tape if you're interested in knowing how 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.640
 get this channel eyes that watch the video 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.500
 do not forget to subscribe to the concept 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.750
 which is here next or here below the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.180
 little button red give laical video if you

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.140
 videos 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.030
 now we are going to start ok let's go to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.910
 start with the first way to do 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.760
 a channel or that super cute little tail that 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.680
 so almost perfect some people the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.720
 let's do with the gel and this gel is 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.630
 of the mark of bobby brown if you see it 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.790
 it's completely black and I think that 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.710
 this is my favorite to put this gel 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.690
 in my eye I'm going to use a brush 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.220
 sea ​​is number 26 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.960
 and you realize a brush angle 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.880
 this little tree is going to be what is going 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.490
 help to make the little tail of the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 cantal let's start by putting in this 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.960
 night some product and we will remove 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.030
 the product in this capital you give 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.890
 account and constant and good use if not 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.910
 You are right now, I do not bring 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.760
 false pads 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.310
 and what better to start doing these 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.560
 tutorials of the eyes taking advantage of that 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.240
 I do not bring the eyelashes the first thing that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 You have to do when you make a channel 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.940
 with this brush or with a gel is first 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.220
 paint or delimit that line that goes to 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.080
 be the tail and you will be governed by the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.960
 line below your eye that is the 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.600
 curvature that then makes my eye here 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.210
 more or less would this form more or less 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.010
 here about then I can not tell you 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.840
 that all is the same for you then 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.910
 you have to perform as the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.040
 bend your eye so that the tail 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.680
 stay perfectly up and you 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.450
 eye looks very lifted like a cat 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.940
 so the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.280
 laugh at the line below the eye 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.410
 and paint a line like that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.890
 the next thing I'm going to do is going to be 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.010
 paint 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.750
 on 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.750
 the line of the eyelashes 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.750
 and in pegadito 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.940
 you can do as thick line as 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.940
 We want to make an intermediate 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 and here we are going to connect is very easy 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.410
 connect and here we are going to do from outside 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.410
 inward 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.120
 it's very easy with these roll because if 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.520
 you are wrong you can simply 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.660
 drag the product so there is one 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.660
 perfect tail 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.170
 and so we have the first eye let's 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.370
 do now the second eye trying to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.900
 that is as similar as possible 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.900
 following the same technique 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.000
 and well your eyes are left with 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.730
 gel eyeliner 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.740
 now let's do the can of the second 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.480
 shape we are going to use an eyeliner 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.700
 liquid is that I'm going to use today 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.920
 is from the cat bondi brand and this is the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.620
 tattoo line if you saw my last video 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.310
 you will realize that he declared my love to 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.980
 This eyeliner is the best and I 'm going to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.350
 scotch tape help this I feel is 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.300
 coach is the one that is mate, not the shiny one 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.090
 what you are going to do is to cut a 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.209
 little bit of this tape put it 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.250
 in your hand to remove the excess 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.459
 glue and that did not hurt your eye and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.920
 you are going to put it following the line of your 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.500
 eye 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.120
 and what will help us do this is 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.120
 make a perfect channel 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.499
 and let's start making the line 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.499
 first from the inside out 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.000
 this form is ideal for those that we have 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.000
 pulse of maracas 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.370
 and here nothing happens if you're there 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.940
 if you leave the line because when 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.460
 let's remove the tape that's going to go 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.440
 fill in 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.919
 and what we are going to do is make the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.919
 tail 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.680
 if we were filling 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.270
 What is the trainer? Let's see how 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.270
 we have left 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.330
 obviously there can be one or the other 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.330
 medium line lasts one more corregimos 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.280
 the Qatari becomes slow 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.780
 now let's make the other eye 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.380
 and well that's how our eyes stayed with 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.380
 liquid eyeliner 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.710
 now you could put the mascara on the day 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.080
 today I will use the new the 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.360
 benefit for life I'm trying it 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.490
 I still do not know what my opinions are 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.220
 about this new product of benefit 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:32.110
 but our story all very well without 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:34.150
 But my favorite is the peter river and 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.289
 well we conclude our tutorial 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.870

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:42.389
