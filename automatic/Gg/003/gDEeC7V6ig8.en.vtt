I'm<00:00:13.679> not<00:00:13.830> guarantee<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.460> that's<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.910> year

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
I'm not guarantee and that's the year

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.480 
I'm not guarantee and that's the year
range<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.800> from<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
range but just from what I've kind of

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.400 
range but just from what I've kind of
read<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.000> done<00:00:18.420> some<00:00:18.630> research<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.140> that's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
read and done some research on that's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.590 
read and done some research on that's
what<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.650> guessing<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.390> anyway<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
what I'm guessing it is anyway the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.620 
what I'm guessing it is anyway the
problem<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:23.100> fan<00:00:23.430> a/c<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
problem was is that the fan a/c and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.920 
problem was is that the fan a/c and
heater<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.740> went<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> vehicle<00:00:27.269> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
heater all went out in the vehicle so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.320 
heater all went out in the vehicle so
what<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> did<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.130> removed<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.119> blower

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
what I did was is I removed the blower

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.089 
what I did was is I removed the blower
motor<00:00:30.720> thinking<00:00:31.170> that's<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> problem

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
motor thinking that's what the problem

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.450 
motor thinking that's what the problem
was<00:00:32.450> but<00:00:33.450> after<00:00:34.010> inspecting<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.309> bit

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
was but after inspecting it a little bit

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.910 
was but after inspecting it a little bit
further<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> found<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
further I found out that it was a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
further I found out that it was a
connector<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.420> connector

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
connector and you can see this connector

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
connector and you can see this connector
is<00:00:40.760> quite<00:00:41.760> burnt<00:00:43.070> from<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> inside<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:46.670> well

is quite burnt from the inside out well

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.040 
is quite burnt from the inside out well
I<00:00:47.700> found<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> very

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I found out that this is a very

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
I found out that this is a very

goes<00:02:16.439> into<00:02:16.859> and<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.579> works<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.000> fine<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:19.260> we

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
goes into and it works just fine so we

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:25.399 
goes into and it works just fine so we
went<00:02:19.620> from<00:02:19.739> $800<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:21.650> $30.00<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:24.319> couldn't<00:02:25.319> be

as<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.519> can<00:02:59.700> see<00:03:00.169> this<00:03:01.169> is<00:03:01.409> where<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.769> would<00:03:01.950> go

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
as you can see this is where it would go

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.000 
as you can see this is where it would go
right<00:03:02.400> here<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.939> all<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.389> solid<00:03:03.659> piece<00:03:04.010> so

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
right here it's all one solid piece so

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.640 
right here it's all one solid piece so
what<00:03:05.280> I've<00:03:05.400> done<00:03:05.669> is<00:03:06.200> from<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.290> recommendation

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
what I've done is from a recommendation

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.550 
what I've done is from a recommendation
of<00:03:08.069> another<00:03:08.340> website<00:03:08.579> was<00:03:09.389> just<00:03:09.689> using<00:03:09.900> exacto

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
of another website was just using exacto

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.640 
of another website was just using exacto
knife<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.489> cut<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.939> top<00:03:12.329> portion<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
knife and I cut out the top portion the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.740 
knife and I cut out the top portion the
right<00:03:13.889> side<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.730> bottom<00:03:14.909> portion<00:03:15.329> as

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
right side and the bottom portion as

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.009 
right side and the bottom portion as
well

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
well

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.050 
well
I<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:16.799> cut<00:03:17.069> because<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.579> little<00:03:17.790> groove

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I just cut because it's a little groove

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.369 
I just cut because it's a little groove
in<00:03:18.239> there<00:03:18.449> so<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.109> just<00:03:19.169> cut<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:21.109> all<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.260> way

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
in there so I just cut that all the way

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.710 
in there so I just cut that all the way
through<00:03:22.709> which<00:03:22.919> was<00:03:23.069> very<00:03:23.280> simple<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:23.879> just

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
through which was very simple and just

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.930 
through which was very simple and just
pops<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.139> out<00:03:25.260> now<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.799> left<00:03:26.129> this<00:03:26.370> side<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.760> kind

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
pops it out now I left this side is kind

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.599 
pops it out now I left this side is kind
of<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> hinge<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.470> once<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.189> get<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
of like a hinge so that once I get the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.789 
of like a hinge so that once I get the
air<00:03:30.209> filter<00:03:30.689> in<00:03:30.840> there<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.049> can<00:03:31.349> just<00:03:31.379> put<00:03:31.709> it

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
air filter in there I can just put it

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.129 
air filter in there I can just put it
back<00:03:31.949> and<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.790> sealed<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.840> doesn't

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
back and it's sealed so that it doesn't

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.589 
back and it's sealed so that it doesn't
fall<00:03:34.319> out<00:03:34.939> so<00:03:35.939> I'll<00:03:36.030> go<00:03:36.180> ahead<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.449> do<00:03:36.569> that

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
fall out so I'll go ahead and do that

00:03:36.599 --> 00:04:02.550 
fall out so I'll go ahead and do that
now

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.699

can actually buy the part for this threw
up<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:11.709> part<00:04:12.709> shop<00:04:13.099> or<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.939> salvage<00:04:14.900> yard<00:04:15.190> that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
up a part shop or a salvage yard that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.909 
up a part shop or a salvage yard that
will<00:04:16.310> actually<00:04:16.519> fit<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:17.180> here<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:18.410> proper<00:04:18.769> way
