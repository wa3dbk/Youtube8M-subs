some<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> skirt<00:01:55.130> would<00:01:55.280> say<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.030> is

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
some of the skirt would say and this is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.570 
some of the skirt would say and this is
how<00:01:56.390> we<00:01:56.450> discussed<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.619> know<00:01:57.740> stuff<00:01:58.490> like

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
how we discussed it you know stuff like

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.010 
how we discussed it you know stuff like
that<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.849> then<00:01:59.149> there's<00:01:59.300> other<00:01:59.420> times<00:01:59.660> where

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
that and then there's other times where

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.040 
that and then there's other times where
I<00:02:00.050> had<00:02:00.619> my<00:02:00.649> own<00:02:00.950> ideas<00:02:01.429> or<00:02:01.640> yeah<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.509> may<00:02:02.959> have

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
I had my own ideas or yeah I may have

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.600 
I had my own ideas or yeah I may have
come<00:02:03.289> up<00:02:03.319> with<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.560> different<00:02:03.770> idea<00:02:04.190> that<00:02:04.399> might

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
come up with a different idea that might

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.029 
come up with a different idea that might
work<00:02:04.819> better<00:02:05.149> than<00:02:06.050> what<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.259> discussed<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
work better than what we discussed and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.480 
work better than what we discussed and
then<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.250> was<00:02:07.399> already

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
then I was already

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.490 
then I was already
you<00:02:09.880> know<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.360> go<00:02:10.480> for<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:12.250> i<00:02:12.640> guess<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you know just go for it so i guess the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.570 
you know just go for it so i guess the
unfortunate<00:02:14.500> subject<00:02:14.890> matter<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.400> course

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
unfortunate subject matter is of course

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.410 
unfortunate subject matter is of course
that<00:02:15.970> Greg<00:02:16.840> rock<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.200> no<00:02:17.650> longer<00:02:17.860> working<00:02:18.040> with

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that Greg rock is no longer working with

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.810 
that Greg rock is no longer working with
50<00:02:19.420> c<00:02:19.600> anymore<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.560> i'm<00:02:21.220> guessing<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
50 c anymore and i'm guessing that the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.030 
50 c anymore and i'm guessing that the
future<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:23.020> one<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.350> very<00:02:23.500> hazy<00:02:23.770> at<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
future that one is very hazy at the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.140 
future that one is very hazy at the
moment<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:26.410> character<00:02:26.860> i<00:02:26.890> think<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.850> going

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
moment the character i think is is going

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.840 
moment the character i think is is going
to<00:02:28.210> be<00:02:28.330> around<00:02:28.630> DC's<00:02:29.590> very<00:02:30.160> committed<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
to be around DC's very committed to the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.050 
to be around DC's very committed to the
character<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:33.040> much<00:02:33.250> more<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.490> can<00:02:33.550> really<00:02:33.790> say

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
character not much more I can really say

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.650 
character not much more I can really say
about<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.510> other<00:02:34.900> than<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:36.180> besides<00:02:37.180> very

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
about it other than that besides very

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.750 
about it other than that besides very
disappointing<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.470> yeah<00:02:38.890> Greg<00:02:39.250> felt<00:02:39.490> like

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
disappointing that yeah Greg felt like

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.240 
disappointing that yeah Greg felt like
he<00:02:40.030> needed<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:41.140> move<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.530> do<00:02:41.860> something

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
he needed to move on and do something

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.390 
he needed to move on and do something
else<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.960> really<00:02:44.080> hoping<00:02:44.200> he<00:02:44.590> would<00:02:44.770> stick

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.330 
else I was really hoping he would stick
around<00:02:45.610> at<00:02:45.790> least<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:47.230> know<00:02:47.350> our<00:02:47.920> original

figure out a way to come up with a new
number<00:04:00.240> one<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:01.890> be<00:04:02.340> kinda<00:04:02.910> like<00:04:03.000> an<00:04:03.150> insert

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
number one to be kinda like an insert

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.660 
number one to be kinda like an insert
and<00:04:03.750> chapter<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.530> didn't<00:04:04.800> exist<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:07.520> we<00:04:08.520> had

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
and chapter that didn't exist and we had

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.160 
and chapter that didn't exist and we had
talked<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.940> over<00:04:09.270> came<00:04:09.720> over<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.990> really

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
talked to over came over the really

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.400 
talked to over came over the really
great<00:04:10.410> number<00:04:10.800> one<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.840> would<00:04:12.960> made<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.290> to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
great number one and it would made it to

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.470 
great number one and it would made it to
where<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.610> amount<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.880> work<00:04:15.090> being<00:04:15.390> done

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
where the amount of work being done

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.870 
where the amount of work being done
would<00:04:15.990> have<00:04:16.020> been<00:04:16.230> close<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.770> another<00:04:17.400> seven

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
would have been close to another seven

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.600 
would have been close to another seven
issues<00:04:18.450> instead<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.930> five<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:20.040> finish<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
issues instead of five to finish up the

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.410 
issues instead of five to finish up the
run<00:04:21.650> but<00:04:22.650> then<00:04:22.800> he<00:04:23.190> decided<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.700> interesting

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
run but then he decided that interesting

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.470 
run but then he decided that interesting
to<00:04:24.660> move<00:04:24.870> move<00:04:25.530> on<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.980> do<00:04:26.040> something<00:04:26.430> else<00:04:26.550> so

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
to move move on and do something else so

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.950 
to move move on and do something else so
I'll<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.020> fell<00:04:28.260> apart<00:04:28.380> at<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.010> end

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
I'll kind of fell apart at the end

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.559 
I'll kind of fell apart at the end
I<00:04:30.100> do<00:04:31.100> i<00:04:31.250> do<00:04:31.460> hope<00:04:31.729> at<00:04:31.880> some<00:04:32.060> point<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.419> the

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
sleep that part of the story alone and

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.570 
sleep that part of the story alone and
let<00:04:59.569> Greg<00:04:59.870> decide<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:01.130> know<00:05:01.190> maybe<00:05:01.340> he'll

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
let Greg decide you know maybe he'll

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.210 
let Greg decide you know maybe he'll
come<00:05:01.759> back<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.300> year<00:05:02.330> or<00:05:02.630> two<00:05:03.050> years<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.620> want

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
come back in a year or two years I want

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.270 
come back in a year or two years I want
to<00:05:04.340> finish<00:05:04.759> that<00:05:04.880> part<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.389> story<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:06.740> think

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
to finish that part of the story I think

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.529 
to finish that part of the story I think
there's<00:05:07.639> room<00:05:07.820> for<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.060> character<00:05:08.419> to

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
there's room for the character to

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.320 
there's room for the character to
continue<00:05:09.110> without<00:05:09.830> necessarily<00:05:10.430> dressing<00:05:11.210> no

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
continue without necessarily dressing no

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.159 
continue without necessarily dressing no
specific<00:05:11.870> plot<00:05:12.139> lines<00:05:13.750> because<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.930> way<00:05:15.139> we

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
specific plot lines because the way we

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.010 
specific plot lines because the way we
ended<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.800> could<00:05:16.160> go<00:05:16.310> anywhere<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:17.780> last

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
ended it could go anywhere that last

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.189 
ended it could go anywhere that last
chapter<00:05:18.530> we<00:05:18.560> go<00:05:18.889> anywhere<00:05:19.250> from<00:05:19.340> there<00:05:20.199> so

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
chapter we go anywhere from there so

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.360 
chapter we go anywhere from there so
hopefully<00:05:21.349> you<00:05:21.680> know<00:05:21.770> we're<00:05:21.919> going<00:05:22.099> to<00:05:22.159> tell

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
hopefully you know we're going to tell

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.670 
hopefully you know we're going to tell
that<00:05:22.550> story<00:05:22.669> someday<00:05:23.090> with<00:05:23.509> Greg<00:05:23.780> being<00:05:24.440> able

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
that story someday with Greg being able

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.129 
that story someday with Greg being able
to<00:05:24.740> be<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.949> one<00:05:25.099> write<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.789> think<00:05:26.300> would<00:05:27.020> be

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
to be the one write it I think would be

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.649 
to be the one write it I think would be
the<00:05:27.169> best<00:05:27.520> situation<00:05:28.520> for<00:05:28.909> that<00:05:29.210> part<00:05:29.509> of<00:05:29.599> the

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
the best situation for that part of the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.860 
the best situation for that part of the
story<00:05:29.750> of<00:05:30.080> for<00:05:30.199> sure<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:31.669> with<00:05:32.180> future
