00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.059
 so today I decided to 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.310
 to do good to the buyers so with 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.230
 a 13 actually on the back of the head 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.340
 which is a very simple way of doing 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.560
 things you can see with a pretty 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.360
 neckline at the back it can be 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.590
 very pretty 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.349
 I hope you enjoy it and 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.930
 I tell you right now for the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.180
 demonstration we will put all our 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:44.129
 hair backwards and make a 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:49.150
 work nor voice to separate a party 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.729
 takes big yes that's separate this 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.689
 part in three to make a mat 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.680
 here and we start again and the attraction without 

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:06.640
 have it on the right 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.850
 their two daughters then part of 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.850
 left 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:24.830
 and we will lend them the same process 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:27.500
 so the right part as the part 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.010
 from brad we will hand over 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.990
 we're going to see her put back in the middle that far 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.860
 by the way we will take the mining of 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.740
 hair we will add to what we come 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.890
 to integrate and the same thing for the other 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.190
 side for the part that will go to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:58.490
 center we will add hair that 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:02.660
 come from debt and so we're going 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.460
 continue the same way by passing the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.090
 right part in the middle and in there 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:15.500
 adding hair and so on 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:19.810
 to go down all the way down so you 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:26.470
 see how we do it again and that's it 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.470
 the braid a train to form that little 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.690
 there was something left 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.960
 okay we're going to make a mat actually 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.590
 simply continue to draw up the 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.590
 breed of herens head 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.620
 will take a little rubber band and we will 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.910
 tie your nat 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.959
 so the fact that it's a little to the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.900
 tick is still very important 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.860
 because we're going to put this part of 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 hair inside god the debt so 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.510
 clearly this kind of restic of all 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:22.190
 fangs as usual to put in 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:24.230
 fire is to be avoided therefore to his neighbor 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.500
 drawing snow everywhere and we're going 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.480
 to make a hole and there it should be done 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.660
 rally debut I can easily 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.480
 no problem because in fact I have not 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.220
 too much is stiff on the bond 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.319
 made too tight we will not be able to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.670
 to get in the hair because our goal 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:47.540
 this is the part that is loose not bad at 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.709
 to enter the map 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.890
 your hair well and they were all at 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:03.560
 interior 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:08.780
 well here and from our goal is going 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.190
 to be great depends on China have helped 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:17.000
 to make sure that all the horses of 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:20.060
 saddle that's what gives that which 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.880
 regards small hair in front of all 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.080
 the contests and leave like that you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.949
 insert me with insert 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.750
 I like what I find pretty pretty or 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:36.819
 worth you can all brought closer with 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.819
 ends that's what it can give 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:47.419
 the top of the head and the china come in 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:50.360
 well that's what it can see you 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.800
 the moment the tessin kg and is done but 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.810
 it's still a coaching then 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.000
 necessarily you'll have anyway 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.340
 a lot more volume at that level 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.259
 apartment you have long hair 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.650
 hair for fine hair that 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.110
 market 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.210
 also there would be just a lot 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.090
 less volume but it will hold the 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.690
 same way it's a look to wear at 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.690
 job 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.090
 a wedding here is something 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.479
 of elaborate enough but if you want that 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.979
 it makes less - pro just 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:24.379
 let letting go a few wicks 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.979
 hair to make it a little more 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.509
 a little more blurry from the front and two 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.250
 behind it is still some 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.680
 very tight thing like a big 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.270
 chignon salon here safin a 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.919
 alternative still quite different 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.000
 to chinon who would have in the world can 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.000
 still be pretty boring
