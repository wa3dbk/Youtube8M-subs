00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.590
 to go alone everyone is gabriel 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.419
 or kiki as you prefer 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.840
 and today we still find ourselves 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.449
 times for a new top 5 so a top 5 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.189
 fashion but a fairly specific category 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.960
 of fashion to put the dimensions 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.910
 so minecraft modes that adds 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.320
 dimensions like the nether so that's it 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.850
 so all links will be in the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.640
 description as I always say 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.589
 it's my personal choice do not miss 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.879
 if you find that second place 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.640
 is better than the first place seen 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.690
 something like that but but the title says 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.940
 me in the comments that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.559
 I'm interested is then on this I you 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.900
 wish a good video I hope it 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.820
 will please you 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.400
 so go to the fifth position on 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.119
 first dimensional mode this is going to be the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.350
 limbo mode so this is a mode that has 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.390
 quite simple actually there's no outside 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.549
 there's nothing that really adds to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.939
 apart from being dark hours it is very 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.270
 dark 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.920
 the wood is very dark the grass is everything 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.229
 black so that gives a pretty atmosphere 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.570
 particular but who can without 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.310
 doubt please you so that's enough 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.630
 simple I think he'll have some bets 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.130
 who wants to add a lot of stuff 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.960
 cool but for now it's that 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.560
 but it's still worth it 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.770
 try 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.219
 so that's it for limbo so at the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.359
 fourth position we have the dimension 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.770
 legends 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.479
 so sorry I have not got any more 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 film myself this little sequence 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.130
 so the welcome the quality is to his 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.079
 passes he ranks the rendering distance 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.579
 is so cool but that's cool that me 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.020
 dimension 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.939
 I'll quickly talk about it if there are 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.899
 cyclops of the minotaur dragoons and 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.729
 bosses it's but it's so 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.590
 I tried to be honest without 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.420
 want to vex anybody without wanting 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.590
 to offend people who like it but 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 it's not my favorite but it's worth 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 try also so at the third 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.200
 position there we will go a little bit more 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.689
 slowly sorry it was fast enough 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.869
 his first his first clips 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.440
 so we have the twilight dimension mode 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.190
 pau-west making it a forest with a 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.960
 very nice atmosphere so to place him 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.270
 undermined by fireflies as you can 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.930
 see the trees are huge which 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.900
 gives a desire 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.459
 what but I said very nice there is the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.590
 generation the world is very very good 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.689
 damned so we have big trees like 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.359
 that all the arts are pretty big like 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.340
 you could see it we have castles 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.219
 with a very nice architecture that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.090
 are generated on the one hand by the dimension 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:43.579
 no it's really cool actually 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.079
 and then that's about all for the 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.209
 twilight forrest I leave you 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.599
 discover it for yourself but it's worth 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.599
 we really know it 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:57.590
 nice enough as i had to i myself 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.419
 so repeat in the 2nd position we have the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.970
 mode that you surely know so 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:04.760
 it's tropics raft so it's a 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.709
 dimension actually to the tropics and 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.030
 frankly there is nothing to say except 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.620
 it's just great 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.780
 charming in fact so much there are some good 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.299
 players in trees the generation of the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.459
 world it's super well done and it gives a 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.709
 summer atmosphere of the water is beautiful 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.970
 we see you some clips it's 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.430
 super well done so that's the band 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.250
 announcement of the mode we see you and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.720
 super clear there are new modes that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.919
 are raging and new modes forgive 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.870
 which are added there are fish 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.939
 can do aquariums there are some 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.269
 volcanoes so it's simply 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.099
 fantastic years I want to say so 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.049
 I'll let you watch the end of this 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.449
 little trailer we find ourselves for 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.449
 the first position to the east 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.120
 so that's the first position 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.120
 it's an old classic I want to 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.760
 to say but it's still always 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.810
 as magical actually because it's 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.370
 the isr and it's just 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.870
 so although it was so 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.450
 it's a lot of people who have who are 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.769
 collaborate for for this mode 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.910
 so that's why it's so 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.770
 so well done there are donations 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.010
 legs three levels of bronze dungeons 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.360
 money and gold it's actually it's the 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.190
 paradise I want to say because 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.740
 it's in the sky does it's a little 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.230
 the opposite of the never and it's so 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.270
 well done there are flying pigs already 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.070
 that it's seen it's worth to test the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.920
 fashion i want to say there are some words to 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.230
 who are flying birds 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.560
 it's the dungeon outside there are 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.350
 bumps there are infinity of 10 themes 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.050
 which are added so here it is 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.830
 frankly one and preferred mode 6.6 not 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.690
 good your favorite and on that I'm going to you 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.850
 let's look at the end of this little 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.030
 trailer and we will end up at the 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.990
 end for some information and then 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.110
 it'll be all for this video go 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.110
 right now 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.840
 here it is, so it happened quite 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.440
 quickly I 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.050
 do it quickly and braise so that you are 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.850
 see just what to see and I 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.639
 informs you of the dimensions that I 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.470
 find cool so I really hope that 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.580
