00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.709
 hello friends on this occasion 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:10.150
 I will teach how to change the language of 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:12.440
 windows 8 from English to Spanish 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.440
 probably you were sent a 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.170
 laptop from the usa that 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.640
 they come in English and you get a 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.189
 little hard to understand 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.029
 one more sense solution and instead of 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.669
 Formatting is install the package 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 languages for this you need to download 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.390
 a file 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 that is called lp dotcom this file 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.100
 weighs 105 mb 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.710
 Y 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.170
 I could not find the link 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.019
 Microsoft official so I can not 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.739
 provide the link to others 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.710
 servers for legal reasons but 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.920
 if you can find this 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.659
 file as I was saying it weighs 105 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.659
 megabyte I already have it here 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 it is point out the format is point fits 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.080
 once we have downloaded it 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.790
 we execute a command the command to 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.790
 execute is this 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.570
 press a windows key and then the u 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.140
 r key 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.310
 they appear the console can observe 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 that everything is in English 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.230
 and here is the the assistant 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.570
 we give you next install display lewis 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.540
 we give you browse to look for where 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.900
 we have as I already have it as they 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.330
 was mentioning is the lp file 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.930
 point here one hundred 5 mb 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.940
 we give him ok 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.150
 here it detects us that is the language 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.970
 Spanish 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.880
 the file and has unpacked has a 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.390
 size 400 mb 400 thousand 400 20 mb 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.630
 we give you net 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.959
 we read this very carefully to see 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.620
 If we agree or do not continue 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.390
 we give you next and here goes the process of 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.910
 installation 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.650
 and this may take a few minutes 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.690
 depending on the speed of the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 processor and the amount of memory 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.510
 ram that you have on your computer in this 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.480
 case they are installing it in a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.310
 computer with a processor and core 3 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.760
 with 6 gb of ram 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:51.500
 It is worth mentioning that this is currently 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.080
 for the 64 bit platform and I have not 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.380
 had the opportunity to try it on the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.849
 32 bit platform but it has 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.420
 operated 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.450
 in 64 bits in fact I already did what 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.130
 you decide TV to be able to record this 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.340
 video 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.560
 I'm going to pause the video so they can 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.819
 so you do not have to wait long 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.380
 the process once finished 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:23.299
 again he resumed it and so they can 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.010
 see the following procedure for 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.640
 change the language that is merely 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.580
 simple once this has been this bar 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.620
 already completed 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.620
 I will tell you what is going on 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.209
 something more for people who can 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.760
 to say no maybe he's doing that 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.180
 procedure in windows 7 actually 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.460
 no and we can see that it is 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.830
 effectively windows 8 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.090
 the installation process is about 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.900
 to finish and I'll give you what goes on 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.900
 and it's simpler 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.650
 very well the process of 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.989
 installation of the language pack 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.840
 you can see that even though 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.510
 installed nothing has changed now what 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.549
 that what we have to do is what 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.160
 next we see here in the part 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.160
 below we click here 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.810
 and we go to preference languages 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:33.760
 here we add a new language 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.760
 look more for espanyol 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.040
 we select the one that suits us 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.040
 we are very well 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.870
 now we give 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.030
 and with this we will be changing our 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.660
 operating system to espanyol 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.700
 We restart the computer and pull this 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.120
 video has been thanks to today's new 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.120
 dot com
