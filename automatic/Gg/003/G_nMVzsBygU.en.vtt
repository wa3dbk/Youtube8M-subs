00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.780 
are aware of it I don't know where the
microphone<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.040> at<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> top

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
microphone is if it's at like the top

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060 
microphone is if it's at like the top
wait<00:01:39.420> no<00:01:39.600> top<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> phone<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.890> bottom

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
wait no top of the phone or the bottom

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.429 
wait no top of the phone or the bottom
of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> phone<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.600> clearly<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.110> problem

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of the phone so that's clearly a problem

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.569 
of the phone so that's clearly a problem
that<00:01:43.530> I've<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.920> figure<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.549> own

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that I've got to figure out on my own

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.060 
that I've got to figure out on my own
and<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.509> other<00:01:45.689> thing<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.860> holding

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and the other thing is that I'm holding

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.330 
and the other thing is that I'm holding
the<00:01:47.720> camera<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> phone<00:01:49.380> itself<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the camera or the phone itself in a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
the camera or the phone itself in a
landscape<00:01:50.729> mode<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:52.229> went<00:01:52.470> ahead<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
landscape mode now when i went ahead and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.280 
landscape mode now when i went ahead and
actually<00:01:53.220> did<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> video<00:01:54.030> i<00:01:54.240> did<00:01:54.750> an<00:01:54.960> earlier

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
actually did the video i did an earlier

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually did the video i did an earlier
video<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.070> whether<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.759> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
video just to see whether or not this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.359 
video just to see whether or not this
would<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.240> work<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.020> i<00:01:58.049> did<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.770> test

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
would actually work but i did a test

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
would actually work but i did a test
video<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.540> video<00:02:00.689> actually<00:02:01.079> appeared

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
video and the video actually appeared

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.520 
video and the video actually appeared
cockeyed<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.180> reason<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.750> doesn't<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cockeyed for some reason it doesn't know

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
cockeyed for some reason it doesn't know
to<00:02:04.590> rotate<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> video<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.880> an<00:02:06.060> iphone<00:02:06.479> does

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to rotate the video like an iphone does

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.139 
to rotate the video like an iphone does
we're<00:02:07.439> okay<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.369> into<00:02:08.580> landscape

and clearly that's it's a little

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
and clearly that's it's a little
problem<00:02:13.770> there<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.450> and
