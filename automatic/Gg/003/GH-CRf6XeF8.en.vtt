introduction to genetics a lot of this
is<00:00:13.349> review<00:00:13.769> from<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.250> did<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.580> terms<00:00:14.790> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
is review from what we did in terms of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.910 
is review from what we did in terms of
the<00:00:15.150> cell<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.540> mitosis<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.770> we're<00:00:16.890> just

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
the cell and mitosis but we're just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.689 
the cell and mitosis but we're just
going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> overview<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.970> gene<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.449> protein

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
going to overview from gene to protein

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.250 
going to overview from gene to protein
first<00:00:20.699> definition<00:00:21.180> genetics<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> study

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
first definition genetics is the study

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.519 
first definition genetics is the study
of<00:00:22.320> inheritable<00:00:23.070> characteristics

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
with t going to a and a going to t so

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.770 
with t going to a and a going to t so
they're<00:05:01.729> complementary<00:05:03.970> their<00:05:04.970> wound<00:05:05.330> around

they're complementary their wound around
each<00:05:06.200> other<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.710> that<00:05:06.740> they<00:05:06.979> make<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.159> double

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490

amino acid for example the code tac on
DNA<00:05:19.880> in<00:05:20.120> order<00:05:21.039> would<00:05:22.039> code<00:05:22.370> for<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.180> amino

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
DNA in order would code for the amino

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.080 
DNA in order would code for the amino

acid methionine once it's translated
into<00:05:26.270> RNA<00:05:26.720> and<00:05:27.020> then<00:05:27.140> brought<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.440> the

cytoplasm<00:05:28.280> now<00:05:29.240> why<00:05:29.419> is<00:05:29.479> there<00:05:29.960> a

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
cytoplasm now why is there a

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.750

three-letter<00:05:30.710> code<00:05:33.159> well<00:05:34.159> a<00:05:34.190> three-letter

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
three-letter code well a three-letter

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.270 
three-letter code well a three-letter
code<00:05:35.000> imagine<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.659> just<00:05:35.690> had<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.590> four<00:05:36.860> bases

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
code imagine you just had the four bases

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.250 
code imagine you just had the four bases
a<00:05:37.510> T<00:05:38.510> C<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.830> G<00:05:40.550> how<00:05:41.060> many<00:05:41.270> amino<00:05:41.510> acids<00:05:42.050> could

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
a T C and G how many amino acids could

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.100 
a T C and G how many amino acids could
you<00:05:42.380> code<00:05:42.620> for<00:05:42.909> well<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:43.940> could<00:05:44.120> only<00:05:44.270> code<00:05:44.599> 44

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
you code for well you could only code 44

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.270 
you code for well you could only code 44
there's<00:05:46.870> there<00:05:47.870> are<00:05:48.050> approximately<00:05:48.830> 20<00:05:49.130> amino

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
there's there are approximately 20 amino

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.959 
there's there are approximately 20 amino
acids<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:49.909> this<00:05:50.090> is<00:05:50.419> not<00:05:50.750> enough<00:05:51.820> imagine<00:05:52.820> then

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
acids so this is not enough imagine then

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.390 
acids so this is not enough imagine then
what<00:05:53.599> what<00:05:53.870> could<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:54.169> do<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.409> with<00:05:54.830> just<00:05:55.250> if

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
what what could you do to with just if

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.770 
what what could you do to with just if
you<00:05:55.490> just<00:05:55.700> have<00:05:55.880> these<00:05:56.030> four<00:05:56.270> letters<00:05:56.599> how

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
you just have these four letters how

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.630 
you just have these four letters how
could<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.110> code<00:05:57.349> for<00:05:57.590> more<00:05:57.770> well<00:05:58.430> you<00:05:58.520> could

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
could you code for more well you could

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.230 
could you code for more well you could
pair<00:05:58.909> them<00:05:59.090> up<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.479> 80<00:06:00.229> would<00:06:00.950> code<00:06:01.219> for<00:06:01.550> one

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
pair them up so 80 would code for one

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.279 
pair them up so 80 would code for one
amino<00:06:02.990> acid<00:06:03.409> a<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:04.760> could<00:06:05.120> code<00:06:05.330> for<00:06:05.630> another<00:06:05.900> AC

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
amino acid a a could code for another AC

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.120 
amino acid a a could code for another AC
for<00:06:06.950> another<00:06:07.159> and<00:06:07.520> then<00:06:08.090> a<00:06:08.300> G<00:06:09.229> and<00:06:09.469> you<00:06:09.950> could

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
for another and then a G and you could

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.029 
for another and then a G and you could
do<00:06:10.310> this<00:06:10.490> four<00:06:10.729> times<00:06:10.780> ta<00:06:11.780> could<00:06:12.409> code<00:06:12.650> for<00:06:12.890> one

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
do this four times ta could code for one

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.279 
do this four times ta could code for one
thing<00:06:13.370> TT<00:06:14.360> could<00:06:14.630> go<00:06:14.840> for<00:06:15.140> another<00:06:15.169> T<00:06:17.020> TC<00:06:18.020> and

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
thing TT could go for another T TC and

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.020 
thing TT could go for another T TC and
then<00:06:18.469> teaching<00:06:18.950> and<00:06:19.130> keep<00:06:19.460> going<00:06:19.640> through<00:06:19.880> all

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
then teaching and keep going through all

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.130 
then teaching and keep going through all
of<00:06:20.060> us<00:06:20.360> for<00:06:21.219> four<00:06:22.219> and<00:06:22.550> then<00:06:23.150> another<00:06:23.630> two<00:06:23.900> sets

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
of us for four and then another two sets

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.500 
of us for four and then another two sets
of<00:06:24.260> four<00:06:24.500> we<00:06:24.680> could<00:06:24.860> then<00:06:25.010> code<00:06:25.280> for<00:06:25.520> 16<00:06:26.060> amino

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
of four we could then code for 16 amino

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.159 
of four we could then code for 16 amino
acids<00:06:27.130> this<00:06:28.130> is<00:06:28.370> close<00:06:28.880> but<00:06:29.270> not<00:06:29.450> quite<00:06:29.750> at<00:06:30.140> a

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
acids this is close but not quite at a

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.469 
acids this is close but not quite at a
required<00:06:30.770> 20

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
required 20

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.929 
required 20
so<00:06:33.479> in<00:06:33.659> order<00:06:33.780> to<00:06:33.930> get<00:06:34.199> enough<00:06:34.560> we<00:06:35.310> code<00:06:35.639> for

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.939 
so in order to get enough we code for

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.129 
so in order to get enough we code for
three<00:06:36.860> ay-ay-ay<00:06:37.969> codes<00:06:38.969> for<00:06:39.270> one<00:06:39.419> amino<00:06:39.749> acid

acids<00:06:49.740> there's<00:06:50.550> only<00:06:50.819> about<00:06:51.060> 20<00:06:51.569> so<00:06:51.900> this<00:06:52.139> is

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
acids there's only about 20 so this is

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.760 
in excess of what's needed but 16 is not
enough<00:06:55.979> so<00:06:56.490> we<00:06:56.699> need<00:06:56.909> a<00:06:56.939> triplet<00:06:57.419> code<00:07:00.770> I'm

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770
