00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.819
 Now, let me tell you how Maple Story was created . 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.010
 Mephisto fitting is a sequel to Maple Story 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.700
 There are things that do not come to mind. 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.300
 It's pretty and tough in cyber bugs . 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:26.980
 Various occupations and cool couscams 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:31.230
 Making the sequel will inherit all things remain in MapleStory 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.230
 Did you think that will make him a drink 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.260
 If you choose among the many advantages and features that you need to take away 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.190
 I did. 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 The first thing I noticed is the young q and ladder 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 I've seen jump development in free areas . 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 As the number of investment units increased , we made various attempts. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.780
 First , determine the volume that the character can touch , 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.659
 I made it. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 The height of the stepped screw leg is the key card 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:07.830
 The delay and the free movement of the character began to ring. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.750
 The first time you see a map with a level difference 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.350
 I wanted to get the concept out of it somehow, so not only the escape but also the character bright 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.330
 If you remember the standing land, 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.369
 As well as the design shows things much more possible games because many g2g 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.399
 Debut Ben design also has a variety of concepts 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.399
 It was not easy to make and it was the hardest part. 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.619
 As a follow-up tag, you should stick to the new tag 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.700
 Spherical 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 Hashes the block structure with new possibilities 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.819
 The point that it aims to be a fiction 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.679
 Heap of our manipulation is also missed 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:54.659
 Turning the ups and downs of the rooftop provides a familiar way to those who are agitated 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.250
 I wanted to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.250
 It's not a matte number of mouses . 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 What's more cute and probe his cute graphics 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.670
 This is one of the important features of Maple Story . 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.280
 Since I tried to make it into 3d 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:18.750
 It is important that the dot graphic has a lot of constraints when it expresses the cucumber feeling. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.000
 And it said the trip just released an awesome new character Maple Story 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.380
 Makes 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.820
 And what made this bizarre posting possible 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.850
 It is a colorful and open world view that Maple Story pursued . 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.020
 An angel in a medieval sheet metal armor 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.160
 It is not strange to use it with a thug with sunglasses of hip-hop pants f 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.010
 It's a sound. 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.780
 The development team keeps these elements in the sequel of Maple Story features 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.360
 I wanted to 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:56.500
 First I chose Maple Storyton in Kurt b point 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.590
 I made it to 3d just as it was originally going to Hans . 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.030
 I've done some tests. 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:09.460
 Movement of the quotas view deoraguyo Gazelle fit the character well show 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:14.510
 Overturned Shields Shielded Shampoo or Square Shaped After Rule Maple Story 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:21.549
 I've also experimented with more orientations than the Twins. 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.549
 Oh, I have filled the MapleStory other full frame so many new coming
