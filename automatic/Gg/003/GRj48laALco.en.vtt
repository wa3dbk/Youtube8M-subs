awesome match and you've used the mix of
sniping<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.309> let's<00:00:56.309> say<00:00:56.460> L<00:00:56.670> mp7<00:00:57.329> play<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
sniping and let's say L mp7 play and I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
sniping and let's say L mp7 play and I
see<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.120> parts<00:01:00.539> aren't<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.379> most

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
see some parts aren't so good but most

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.380 
see some parts aren't so good but most
of<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
of it is really good and what the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.500 
of it is really good and what the
highlight<00:01:06.390> reel<00:01:06.420> doors<00:01:07.159> is<00:01:08.299> basically<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
best skills and it basically edges and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.530 
best skills and it basically edges and
it's<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> collapse<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.830> uses<00:01:17.540> those

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it's going to collapse and it uses those

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.149

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
gets there's also within mahalo real and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.910 
gets there's also within mahalo real and
you'll<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.000> year<00:01:36.450> kills<00:01:37.320> are<00:01:37.470> rated

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you'll see that all year kills are rated

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
you'll see that all year kills are rated
and<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.670> each<00:01:41.670> clip<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and what this is now is each clip that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
and what this is now is each clip that
is<00:01:42.780> obviously<00:01:43.049> took<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> hot<00:01:43.710> oil<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
is obviously took out the hot oil is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.990 
is obviously took out the hot oil is
rated<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.000> its<00:01:45.180> kill<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:47.549> pretty<00:01:47.820> good

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
rated on its kill so that's pretty good

from<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> said<00:02:52.890> drawing<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> playback<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
from what I said drawing the playback of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.280 
from what I said drawing the playback of
your<00:02:54.270> highlight<00:02:54.540> reel<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.810> system<00:02:55.110> will

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
your highlight reel of a system will

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.990 
your highlight reel of a system will
automatically<00:02:55.770> rate<00:02:56.010> each<00:02:56.190> kill<00:02:56.610> using<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
automatically rate each kill using a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300 
automatically rate each kill using a
five<00:02:57.209> star<00:02:57.450> rating<00:02:57.660> system<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.190> this

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
five star rating system and I think this

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.690 
five star rating system and I think this
is<00:02:59.490> very<00:02:59.520> broad<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.540> best<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.340> black<00:03:02.340> ops<00:03:02.490> 2

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
is very broad is the best is black ops 2

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.520 
is very broad is the best is black ops 2
blow<00:03:03.270> my<00:03:03.450> mind<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.020> now<00:03:04.140> with<00:03:04.290> all<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
stuffings going in and I think this will

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.050 
stuffings going in and I think this will
help<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.840> lot<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.310> especially<00:03:08.310> smaller

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
help a lot of especially smaller
