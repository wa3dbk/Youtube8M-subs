pin<00:02:40.120> along<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.530> edge<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:44.299> then<00:02:44.630> I'll

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
pin along the edge here and then I'll

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.949 
pin along the edge here and then I'll
take<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> next<00:02:45.380> step<00:02:45.620> okay<00:02:46.660> okay<00:02:47.660> so

now you've got your right sides together
you're<00:02:51.260> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.470> pin<00:02:51.739> all<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.519> way<00:02:52.610> around

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
you're going to pin all the way around

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.630 
you're going to pin all the way around
and<00:02:53.239> you're<00:02:53.900> probably<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.160> leave<00:02:55.340> an

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640

and you're probably going to leave an
opening<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:57.019> little<00:02:57.650> opening<00:02:58.010> on<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.310> side

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
opening a little opening on the side

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.580 
opening a little opening on the side
here<00:02:58.849> normally<00:02:59.360> we'd<00:02:59.599> do<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.870> on<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.319> edge

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
here normally we'd do it on the edge

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.370 
here normally we'd do it on the edge
seam<00:03:00.980> except<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.579> got<00:03:01.730> our<00:03:01.989> ribbon<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.170> there

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380
