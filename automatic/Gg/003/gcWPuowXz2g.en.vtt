00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.169
 environment to help 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.189
 the format is also very important when starting from the pre- 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.249
 Format 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.329
 and to the waterfront minutes pass a little butter a little flour 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.860

 It's in Brazil, cgi 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:45.169
 interesting is to realize that our departure and putting another great 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.409
 Spotlight 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.120
 you do not pay any link or not 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.709
 in that part of the stage 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.759
 that's what we want 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:55.739
 the company always said the poster was holding a little cloth to do this 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 The process to not burn me because it's a good 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.440
 here we are going to put 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.290
 the sugar first to cool a little fight put the birds straight because 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.240
 as if the guy is very hot and will cook an egg and that is not what the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.999
 people want 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.239
 then we put the first one a little bit of sugar the genie too 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.420
 this also had problems 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.099
 suca 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.099
 first others 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.779
 air 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:39.449
 then it is the little povinho of each wine and without mixing well it is all well homogeneous 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.459
 you see, yes, important people, we have a homogeneous mix 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.789
 the sifted flour 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.569

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.629
 cake dough 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.950
 The last thing they do is home, you little bastards. 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.129
 mixing 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.919
 good 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.369
 but in a form greased with butter and flour also 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.729
 We'll put this mixture together. 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.479
 and this goes pro forma until roasting 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.479
 now we put it in the oven 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.469

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.940
 the little square leaves they created to make a square 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.510
 they put a little plate 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.740
 anyone who wants to glass packaging the villages they are doing will be processed with 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.479
 someone 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.860
