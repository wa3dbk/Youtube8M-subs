00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.980
 what's up, stay, I'm wing haven, me 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.839
 I'm concluding the pixel we're here 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.430
 company of the ncaa where I will teach 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.320
 is a position to cover this area of 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.850
 here behind the dam of the pnc and what is 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.500
 a quite busy area and the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.990
 most typical position which is always seen 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.460
 everywhere is being here back what 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.840
 what happens in both domination and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.550
 then there are usually team 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.470
 enough camper if the mansion the roof 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.240
 of what makes us pretty 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.350
 exposed and especially if some 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.200
 sniper we are basically 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.880
 dead so personally a 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.890
 position that I like a lot and 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 quite competitive course is also 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.180
 in these blocks here we put ourselves in 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.980
 the taps and as you can see we can 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.040
 see both this area here and also 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.180
 the little door as someone enters or leaves 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.980
 what makes it a position 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.840
 pretty good since we're pretty 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.700
 covered so they come to us for the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.930
 lateral or that is not a very well by 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.820
 the back so we're 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.469
 totally dead but I do not know what 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.329
 come for these areas here we are 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.860
 totally covered and of course 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.629
 we can shoot through there is no 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.520
 type of book what makes for example 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.370
 if someone enters or leaves through the door 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.079
 yes yes although it is quite simple as 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.060
 you can see already what we will do 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.619
 we will do the inverse 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.509
 in that position so you can see what it is 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.610
 impossible to see us so now we see each other 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.200
 people now we have invested the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.149
 positions and if you realize it is almost 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.740
 impossible to know what is there even not 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.829
 It does not even mark the player giving him 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.020
 the one and if you notice this white 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.720
 here is the little head what makes it 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.429
 it's impossible to kill him so I'm going to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.990
 say something that I had not said in a while 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.979
 probably too much time so 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 kill me re green 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.229
 and as you can see the sector of green 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.759
 has all the advantage over me so 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.110
 nothing this is the first position I hope 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.430
 that you liked it and we are going to do the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.530
 second 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.450
 and now we are in dawn mode 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.820
 of assault that I always bring domination 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.710
 7 and such that a change is never 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.210
 more and this position told me antonio 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.430
 barcelÃ³ by twitter so many 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.650
 thanks and will consist of defending the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.240
 a bomb that is the first of all and 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.729
 for this we will have to destroy this 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.030
 frame wall as you want to call it with a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.130
 rpg m3 2004 as you wish and as you can see 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.960
 there is a small crack that what we 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 lets see two things the first of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.350
 they allow me is the door so 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.690
 are done in good transplant we can 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.730
 kill and the second if they sneak up on us and 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.860
 planted by the front because 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 as you see if we gain a little angle 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.970
 we can also kill him and shoot 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.430
 three or four straight bullets as well 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.160
 they killed the one who is planting and a 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.989
 small point to the beginning of the round 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.970
 of the map as you want to call it acquisition 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.390
 to see boxes but well a rpg grenades 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.100
 they are destroyed quickly and usually the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.810
 bombs in assault there is often a lot of spam 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.390
 of grenades and such so the safest thing 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.010
 when you go to do this position the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 boxes are already broken in case you do not 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 so be it the rom page and as you have already 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.640
 seen as you have already seen if we do not go up 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.430
 here we can see the door 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.800
 angle because we can see the rest 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.050
 of the pump and I can also 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.020
 shoot at this door here that is the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.240
 shows what is this here and how you see 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.280
 they're going to make it come up here 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.780
 at home that are the school and plant and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.209
 otherwise there will always be the option of 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.220
 terry searles and kill them and from 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.080
 here disable so as always 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.240
 let's do the reverse position and 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.190
 now we see each other and to finish the 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.200
 video let's see how demo canvas in 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 our position since these fixes is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.980
 quite difficult to see what makes 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.230
 if we have a quick look then do not 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.180
 let's see and even if we have an explosive 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.280
 close to you as we have no hit 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.470
 marker what does that when entering then 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940
 we put a fairly simple and 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 these are other positions I wanted 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.900
 show you today I hope you liked it 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.700
 for my part nothing but to add I hope 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.530
 you liked the video and we'll see you in 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.530
 another with people you later bye 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.430
