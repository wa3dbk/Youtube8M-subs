00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 there are constant discussions which is better 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.460
 run on the hills that is, on the slopes 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.400
 tough enough relief either 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 flat surface I want to say that as 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.789
 always the truth lies in the middle of the escape and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.359
 over the hills and have their pluses and their 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.199
 cons and of course running smoothly 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.500
 there are also huge advantages if 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 you have only hilly trails 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 then you can rejoice firstly by running 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 the hills are great at promoting this word 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.579
 component because running on the terrain itself 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.210
 in itself is the best power 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.160
 exercises for the runner and also running 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 the hills or kind 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.570
 interval training is already inside 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.780
 any cross-country and any runs however 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.449
 running over the hills is very difficult 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 heart rate control is very difficult 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.900
 to control 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 total load and keep inside 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.750
 intensity zones are specified especially this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.659
 difficult of course for beginners or for 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 underdeveloped runners 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.270
 cardiovascular and leg strength 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 if you only have a flat track 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 that too you can rejoice because 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.860
 it is on a smooth track you can 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 very clearly plan your 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.880
 training load and speed and heart rate 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.200
 everything can be planned to within 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 seconds per kilometer or before hitting 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.579
 minute however 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.439
 you need to be sure in this case if 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.890
 burn ferry tracks and take care of 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.409
 power companies 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.479
 and add more specials 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.990
 exercise from was either 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.510
 power exercises directed by names 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 development of necessary strength qualities for 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.320
 runner to me
