00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.250 
it like this under the water because
then<00:04:25.729> you're<00:04:25.850> going<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.060> have<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.990> bleach

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
then you're going to have the bleach

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.560 
then you're going to have the bleach
going<00:04:27.710> onto<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.039> hair<00:04:28.340> so<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.090> just<00:04:29.270> held<00:04:29.479> it

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
going onto the hair so I just held it

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.770 
going onto the hair so I just held it
like<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:31.130> then<00:04:32.090> just<00:04:32.150> shampooed<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
like this and then just shampooed and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.279 
like this and then just shampooed and
conditioned<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.530> just<00:04:34.660> moving<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.840> downward

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
conditioned it just moving in a downward

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.080 
conditioned it just moving in a downward
motion<00:04:36.940> but<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.150> looks<00:04:38.419> amazing<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:39.940> would<00:04:40.940> say

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
motion but it looks amazing I would say

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.969 
motion but it looks amazing I would say
about<00:04:41.270> 95%<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.410> knots<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:42.830> been

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
about 95% of the knots have been

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.920 
about 95% of the knots have been
bleached<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.610> still<00:04:43.970> like<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.300> few<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.750> them<00:04:44.900> that

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
bleached I still like a few of them that

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
bleached I still like a few of them that

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
it looks amazing and one way to do is

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.270 
it looks amazing and one way to do is
just<00:04:59.270> put<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.510> little<00:04:59.780> bit<00:05:00.080> well<00:05:00.560> once<00:05:00.800> I<00:05:00.919> sew<00:05:01.130> it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
little bit of foundation onto the lace

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.179 
little bit of foundation onto the lace
part<00:05:07.610> to<00:05:08.030> make<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.300> match<00:05:08.479> my<00:05:08.720> skin<00:05:09.020> tone

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:16.929 
trick I use with my closure to keep it

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:19.109 
trick I use with my closure to keep it
from<00:05:17.110> shedding<00:05:17.409> up<00:05:18.219> I<00:05:18.369> use<00:05:18.520> its<00:05:18.699> acrylic

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:19.119 
from shedding up I use its acrylic

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:24.089 
from shedding up I use its acrylic
cellar<00:05:19.419> here<00:05:19.809> I<00:05:20.020> got<00:05:20.319> this<00:05:20.409> from<00:05:20.589> eBay<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:23.099> it

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
cellar here I got this from eBay and it

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.529 
cellar here I got this from eBay and it
helps<00:05:24.339> with<00:05:24.519> keeping<00:05:25.029> the<00:05:25.149> hair<00:05:25.330> from

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
helps with keeping the hair from

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.600 
helps with keeping the hair from
shedding<00:05:25.809> like<00:05:26.619> sometimes<00:05:27.009> with<00:05:27.129> closures

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
shedding like sometimes with closures

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.689 
shedding like sometimes with closures
the<00:05:27.939> hair<00:05:28.209> can<00:05:28.449> slip<00:05:28.719> out<00:05:28.899> of<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.589> lace<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.309> it

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
the hair can slip out of the lace and it

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.089 
the hair can slip out of the lace and it
can<00:05:30.819> cause<00:05:30.999> bald<00:05:31.389> spots<00:05:31.779> which<00:05:32.649> sucks<00:05:32.949> because

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
can cause bald spots which sucks because

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.499 
can cause bald spots which sucks because
at<00:05:33.459> that<00:05:33.610> point<00:05:33.819> you<00:05:33.969> have<00:05:34.059> to<00:05:34.149> buy<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.330> new

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
at that point you have to buy a new

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.959 
at that point you have to buy a new
closure<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.559> of<00:05:36.249> course<00:05:36.519> these<00:05:36.669> things<00:05:36.849> are

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
closure and of course these things are

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.570 
closure and of course these things are
not<00:05:37.179> cheap<00:05:37.929> so<00:05:38.169> you<00:05:38.949> want<00:05:39.129> to<00:05:39.189> maintain<00:05:39.339> your

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
hair to try to keep it really condensed

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.619 
hair to try to keep it really condensed
to<00:06:00.849> this<00:06:00.939> area<00:06:01.209> here<00:06:03.059> let's<00:06:04.059> do<00:06:04.179> like<00:06:04.329> a<00:06:04.419> little

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.640 

so<00:06:15.060> just<00:06:15.240> let<00:06:15.389> it<00:06:15.480> dry<00:06:15.600> for<00:06:15.630> 15<00:06:16.080> minutes<00:06:16.410> and
