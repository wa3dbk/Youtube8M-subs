and you think of an idea creative idea

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.510 
and you think of an idea creative idea
and<00:01:08.630> then<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:08.840> just<00:01:09.050> kind<00:01:09.259> of<00:01:09.380> latch<00:01:10.190> on<00:01:10.490> to

and then you just kind of latch on to
that<00:01:10.850> idea<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.570> sort<00:01:12.289> of<00:01:12.350> takes<00:01:12.560> your

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
gets tricky because when my mind is

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.229 
gets tricky because when my mind is
going<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:45.139> just<00:03:45.440> want<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:46.069> work<00:03:46.579> on<00:03:46.849> stuff<00:03:47.030> I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.039 
and at that moment it's not all on shut
up<00:03:52.370> so<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:52.609> have<00:03:52.910> noticed<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.450> those<00:03:53.690> moments

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
up so I have noticed that those moments

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.960 
up so I have noticed that those moments
where<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.919> you<00:03:55.190> know<00:03:55.310> it's<00:03:55.340> five<00:03:55.790> o'clock

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
where it's you know it's five o'clock

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.640 
where it's you know it's five o'clock
and<00:03:56.389> that's<00:03:56.569> what<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.750> usually<00:03:57.079> like<00:03:57.169> to<00:03:57.230> shut

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
and that's what I usually like to shut

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.580 
and that's what I usually like to shut

act<00:04:49.389> on<00:04:49.599> that<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.020> don't<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.500> think

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
act on that and you don't you think

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.680 
act on that and you don't you think
maybe<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.160> can't<00:04:51.520> do<00:04:51.789> it<00:04:51.819> because<00:04:52.150> someone<00:04:52.599> else

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
maybe I can't do it because someone else

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.990 
maybe I can't do it because someone else
has<00:04:52.840> done<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.169> but<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:54.009> say<00:04:54.460> write<00:04:54.699> it<00:04:54.849> down

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
anyway because then you can go and

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.969 
anyway because then you can go and
research<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:58.900> see<00:04:59.259> well<00:04:59.440> has<00:04:59.650> someone

and it should be and even when you're
not<00:05:21.610> just<00:05:21.849> observing<00:05:22.389> I<00:05:22.479> know<00:05:22.539> for<00:05:22.840> myself<00:05:22.960> I'm

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
not just observing I know for myself I'm

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.140 
not just observing I know for myself I'm
always<00:05:23.470> observing<00:05:24.039> people<00:05:24.699> even<00:05:24.880> when<00:05:25.120> I

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
always observing people even when I

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.610 
always observing people even when I
don't<00:05:25.389> have<00:05:25.569> my<00:05:25.720> pad<00:05:25.990> with<00:05:26.229> me<00:05:26.380> I'm<00:05:26.470> always

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
don't have my pad with me I'm always

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.490 
don't have my pad with me I'm always
looking<00:05:26.919> at<00:05:27.250> at<00:05:27.520> things<00:05:28.150> just<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.810> see<00:05:29.319> how

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
looking at at things just to see how

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.170 
looking at at things just to see how
they<00:05:29.710> work<00:05:29.919> and<00:05:30.099> I<00:05:30.190> think<00:05:30.400> that's<00:05:30.550> important

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
they work and I think that's important

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.240 
they work and I think that's important
too<00:05:31.360> because<00:05:31.599> in<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.560> way<00:05:32.590> you're<00:05:32.919> sort<00:05:33.130> of

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
too because in a way you're sort of

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.219 
too because in a way you're sort of
drawing<00:05:33.610> in<00:05:33.789> your<00:05:33.940> mind<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:34.659> that<00:05:34.840> can<00:05:35.020> really

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229
