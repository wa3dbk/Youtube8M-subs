00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you should have as a category game

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.870 
you should have as a category game
knowledge<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.710> probably<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> most<00:01:32.310> complex

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
knowledge is probably the most complex

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
knowledge is probably the most complex
of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.049> also<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> easiest

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
of the three but it's also the easiest

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.410 
of the three but it's also the easiest
to<00:01:34.979> improve<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.909> ahead<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.210> rank<00:01:36.329> your

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
