most of the big jump and difficulty I
should<00:04:04.640> probably<00:04:04.970> also<00:04:05.300> further<00:04:05.810> clarify

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
that when I say difficulty I really only

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.160 
that when I say difficulty I really only
mean<00:04:09.709> tedium<00:04:10.390> even<00:04:11.390> when<00:04:11.570> I<00:04:11.600> died<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> never
