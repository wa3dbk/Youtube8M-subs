00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:05.529
Speed management.

00:00:05.597 --> 00:00:07.281
G force.

00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:08.883
Let's run it.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.575
(pronouncing exaggeratedly)
my safe word will be whiskey.

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:20.010
Sorry, rod. What was that?

00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:21.662
(pronouncing exaggeratedly)
whiskey.

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:23.130
Don't you mean whiskey?

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:24.681
What?

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.683
You're saying it weird.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.218
Saying what weird?

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.985
All of it.

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:31.621
Where do you get off?

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.340
I just don't get
why you're
saying it that way.

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:35.476
Why I'm saying
what what way?

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:38.329
Forget it.
I will. I will forget it.

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:42.750
Denise.
Would you kindly
clear the wheels?

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:48.389
Okay, here we go.
On three.

00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:50.474
One,

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.293
Two...
Whoa, whiskey!

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:54.829
Whiskey!

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:57.732
Whiskey!

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.433
Whiskey!

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.419
Whiskey!

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.471
Oh, shit!

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.207
(tires screeching)

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:09.376
Rod!

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.028
Are you okay?

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:12.963
The safety word didn't help.

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:14.248
My trailer! What the hell?

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:17.084
One of you is getting
your dick-hole smashed!

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:20.871
(groaning)

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.426
I'm freaking pumped!
I've been drinking
green tea all goddamn day!

00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:28.663
Oh! Man, he hit his ass
with a parking cone. Nice!

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.465
God, I go to church
every goddamn Sunday!

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.900
You gonna bring
the demons out of me!

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.434
All right, rico.
You got him.
Denise: Rico.

00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:37.238
Not with
the trash can, buddy.
No, no, come on.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.505
Trash!

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:39.907
All right,
let's get him off of him.

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:41.075
Dave: Okay, okay, okay.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.143
Rico: No, no. No!

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.279
This is my hat, now.

00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:47.848
This is totally my hat.
