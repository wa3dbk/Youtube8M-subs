00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
armor ability so it makes sense now in

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.419 
armor ability so it makes sense now in
and<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.439> its<00:02:07.619> basically<00:02:08.190> its

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and it's back to its basically its

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.330 
and it's back to its basically its
classic<00:02:08.910> form<00:02:09.209> which<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
classic form which I really like so that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.700 
classic form which I really like so that

want to bring your game to the next
level<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.580> unfortunately<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.780> most<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.500> these

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
level now unfortunately on most of these

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.890 
level now unfortunately on most of these
loadouts<00:02:47.250> they've<00:02:47.580> switched<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.330> Crouch<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
loadouts they've switched the Crouch to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.050 
loadouts they've switched the Crouch to
be<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.500> basically<00:02:50.130> makes<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.640> Gandhi

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
be which basically makes the Gandhi

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.550 
be which basically makes the Gandhi
hopping<00:02:51.420> impossible<00:02:51.990> unless<00:02:52.200> you're

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
hopping impossible unless you're

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.040 
hopping impossible unless you're
climbing<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> would<00:02:53.640> highly<00:02:54.120> recommend<00:02:54.150> for

climbing so I would highly recommend for

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.800 
climbing so I would highly recommend for

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
if you have to get used to that layout

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.930 
if you have to get used to that layout
and<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.560> takes<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:43.980> while<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.460> worth<00:03:44.730> it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
in the long run trust me but anyways

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280 
in the long run trust me but anyways
that's<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.240> do<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.540> for<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.750> video<00:03:48.930> if

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.700 
of this mosaic out picture that looks
like<00:04:12.150> you're<00:04:12.360> in<00:04:12.450> some<00:04:12.480> sort<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.990> Canyon<00:04:13.530> and

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
like you're in some sort of Canyon and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.430 
like you're in some sort of Canyon and
maybe<00:04:13.890> there's<00:04:14.190> some<00:04:14.490> crazy<00:04:14.910> smoking<00:04:15.690> volcano

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
maybe there's some crazy smoking volcano

maybe there's some crazy smoking volcano
in<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.040> background<00:04:17.580> also<00:04:17.790> in<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> foreground

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
in the background also in the foreground

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.180 
in the background also in the foreground
it<00:04:18.810> looks<00:04:18.960> like<00:04:19.109> maybe<00:04:19.380> there's<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.680> warthog

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
I'm guessing this is some sort of

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.170 
I'm guessing this is some sort of
multiplayer<00:04:22.530> map<00:04:22.830> we'll<00:04:23.070> probably<00:04:23.370> see<00:04:23.850> more
