00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
trick is once you're at center stick on

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.670 
trick is once you're at center stick on
both<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> left<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.600> stay<00:02:45.110> perfect

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
both the left and right stay perfect

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.280 
both the left and right stay perfect

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
Center with a flat pitch curve you want

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.180 
Center with a flat pitch curve you want
to<00:02:51.440> make<00:02:51.560> sure<00:02:51.740> both<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.430> aileron<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.190> your

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
to make sure both the aileron and your

close<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.880> zero<00:03:02.120> they<00:03:02.270> should<00:03:02.480> be<00:03:02.660> pretty<00:03:03.350> much

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
close to zero they should be pretty much

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.160 
close to zero they should be pretty much
at<00:03:03.770> zero<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:06.320> right<00:03:09.190> now<00:03:10.780> what<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.930> want<00:03:12.080> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
at zero all right now what you want to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.440 
at zero all right now what you want to
do<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.220> want<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.489> use<00:03:13.700> your<00:03:13.880> endpoint

alright<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.239> go<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.480> collective<00:03:36.020> pitch

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
alright so if I go to collective pitch

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.680 
alright so if I go to collective pitch
on<00:03:36.380> mines<00:03:36.650> mines<00:03:37.610> goes<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.360> hundred

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.570 
direction as well you see the directions
aren't<00:03:44.600> right<00:03:44.959> then<00:03:45.920> you're<00:03:46.220> gonna<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:46.550> to

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
aren't right then you're gonna have to

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.660 
aren't right then you're gonna have to
reverse<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.209> channel<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.980> radio<00:03:49.310> all

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.290 
radio this is a disclaimer right once
you<00:05:00.560> have<00:05:00.740> that<00:05:00.980> down<00:05:01.280> pack<00:05:01.550> then<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:01.910> see<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
you have that down pack then you see the

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.900 
you have that down pack then you see the
movements<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.870> everything<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:04.130> indicates

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
movements and everything that indicates

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.050 
movements and everything that indicates
that<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.540> gyro<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.820> communicating<00:05:07.820> correctly

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
that the gyro is communicating correctly

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.150 
that the gyro is communicating correctly
what<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.840> receiver<00:05:09.290> is<00:05:09.560> receiving<00:05:09.740> the

what the receiver is receiving the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.910 
what the receiver is receiving the
correct<00:05:10.490> signals<00:05:10.910> from<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.990> transmitter<00:05:12.590> all

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
correct signals from the transmitter all
