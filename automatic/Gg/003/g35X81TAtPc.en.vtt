it's it's a reminder the football

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.889 
it's it's a reminder the football
players<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.829> managers<00:02:01.310> etc<00:02:01.539> there<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.570> name

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
players and managers etc there a name

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.760 
players and managers etc there a name
and<00:02:03.200> an<00:02:03.289> icon<00:02:03.679> to<00:02:03.920> many<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.310> us<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.530> you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
and an icon to many of us but the you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.200 
and an icon to many of us but the you
know<00:02:06.859> some<00:02:07.070> people<00:02:07.100> treated<00:02:07.759> like<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> piece<00:02:08.149> of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
know some people treated like a piece of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.840 
know some people treated like a piece of
meat<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.380> think<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:09.979> some<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.610> need<00:02:10.729> to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
meat and I think that some we need to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.460 
meat and I think that some we need to
remember<00:02:11.030> these<00:02:11.330> people<00:02:11.720> are<00:02:11.810> human<00:02:11.990> as<00:02:12.260> well

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
remember these people are human as well

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.930 
remember these people are human as well
just<00:02:12.710> because<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.130> pair<00:02:13.280> vast<00:02:13.550> amounts<00:02:13.940> of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
just because the pair vast amounts of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.360 
just because the pair vast amounts of
money<00:02:14.840> doesn't<00:02:15.650> mean<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.890> people<00:02:15.950> should

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
money doesn't mean that people should

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.310 
money doesn't mean that people should
present<00:02:16.700> them<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.900> they<00:02:17.990> don't<00:02:18.200> have

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
present them and that they don't have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.450 
present them and that they don't have
any<00:02:18.500> feeling<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.070> should<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.370> be

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
any feeling that they should just be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.220 
any feeling that they should just be
fucking<00:02:19.670> happy<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> millionaires

that's not very pretty and then the

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.729 
that's not very pretty and then the
committal<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.150> know<00:03:35.239> going<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> work<00:03:35.810> or<00:03:36.049> a

now your turn out for our club or
whatever<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:40.549> know<00:03:40.640> maybe<00:03:40.880> not<00:03:41.000> all

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
whatever and you know maybe not all

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.420 
whatever and you know maybe not all
there<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.690> since<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.470> think<00:03:42.650> that's<00:03:42.860> when

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
there and since so I think that's when

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.810 
there and since so I think that's when
it<00:03:43.519> becomes<00:03:43.820> when<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.540> affects<00:03:44.780> their<00:03:44.959> job<00:03:45.820> you

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
it becomes when it affects their job you

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.250 
it becomes when it affects their job you
know<00:03:46.910> if<00:03:47.030> Brendan<00:03:47.390> Rodgers<00:03:47.750> was<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.140> know

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260

doing what not with some chick or
whatever<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.690> people<00:03:51.260> might<00:03:51.530> think<00:03:51.560> that

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
whatever and people might think that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.990 
whatever and people might think that
