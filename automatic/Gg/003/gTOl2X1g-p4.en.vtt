the<00:00:37.170> camera<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.590> actually<00:00:37.770> worn<00:00:38.220> on<00:00:38.400> a

I<00:00:42.629> thought<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> design<00:00:43.500> would<00:00:43.830> be<00:00:44.010> really

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
I thought the design would be really

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.670 
I thought the design would be really
uncomfortable<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.449> surprisingly<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.320> didn't

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
uncomfortable but surprisingly I didn't

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 
uncomfortable but surprisingly I didn't
mind<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> headpiece

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
mind it much the back of the headpiece

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.689 
mind it much the back of the headpiece
is<00:00:48.900> adjustable<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> camera<00:00:50.220> sits<00:00:50.460> right

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
of view angle is really nice the color

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.390 
of view angle is really nice the color
looked<00:02:54.060> good<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.540> images<00:02:55.140> staged<00:02:55.409> sharp<00:02:55.859> even

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
looked good and images staged sharp even

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.459 
looked good and images staged sharp even
when<00:02:56.790> driving<00:02:56.969> pretty<00:02:57.420> fast<00:02:57.510> on<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.079> highway

when driving pretty fast on the highway

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.160 
when driving pretty fast on the highway
I<00:02:58.680> was<00:02:59.250> not<00:02:59.459> quite<00:02:59.969> as<00:03:00.180> impressed<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:01.019> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
I was not quite as impressed with the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.020 
I was not quite as impressed with the
low-light<00:03:01.590> video<00:03:01.889> as<00:03:02.069> I'd<00:03:02.219> hoped<00:03:02.459> but

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
low-light video as I'd hoped but

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.550 
low-light video as I'd hoped but
depending<00:03:03.389> on<00:03:03.480> how<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.719> plan<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.049> use<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
depending on how you plan to use the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.220 
depending on how you plan to use the
footage<00:03:04.799> I'd<00:03:05.400> say<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.819> passable<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:07.079> are

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
footage I'd say it's passable there are

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.300 
footage I'd say it's passable there are
three<00:03:07.530> angles<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.129> view<00:03:08.310> wide<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.269> 160<00:03:10.079> degrees

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
three angles of view wide at 160 degrees

standard at 117 degrees with the image
stabilization<00:03:14.519> off<00:03:15.150> or<00:03:15.659> you<00:03:16.379> could<00:03:16.620> choose<00:03:16.889> to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
use the cameras built-in image

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.420 
use the cameras built-in image
stabilization<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.769> angle<00:03:20.069> will<00:03:20.099> change

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
stabilization and the angle will change

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.629

to 104 degrees a mono aural microphone
is<00:03:23.790> built-in<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:24.599> it<00:03:24.719> picks<00:03:25.049> up<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.349> lot<00:03:25.530> of

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
is built-in but it picks up a lot of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.559 
is built-in but it picks up a lot of
wind<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.219> because<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.909> camera<00:03:27.060> literally

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
wind and because the camera literally

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.629 
wind and because the camera literally
sits<00:03:27.930> right<00:03:28.169> against<00:03:28.680> your<00:03:28.739> cheek<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.310> they

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
sits right against your cheek and they

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.159 
sits right against your cheek and they
brush<00:03:29.879> your<00:03:30.060> face<00:03:30.359> or<00:03:30.780> pick<00:03:31.019> up<00:03:31.109> your

brush your face or pick up your
breathing<00:03:31.650> as<00:03:31.769> well<00:03:31.799> ah<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:33.180> thing<00:03:33.450> that

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
breathing as well ah one thing that

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.539 
breathing as well ah one thing that
bothers<00:03:34.109> me<00:03:34.139> about<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.739> camera<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
bothers me about this camera is that

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.119 
bothers me about this camera is that
there's<00:03:35.849> no<00:03:36.120> removable<00:03:36.840> battery<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.889> you<00:03:37.980> can

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
there's no removable battery so you can

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.459 
there's no removable battery so you can
shoot<00:03:38.310> for<00:03:38.669> roughly<00:03:39.060> three<00:03:39.450> hours<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:40.319> then

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:40.469 
shoot for roughly three hours but then

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:41.839 
shoot for roughly three hours but then
the<00:03:40.560> camera<00:03:40.859> will<00:03:40.889> need<00:03:41.189> to<00:03:41.280> be<00:03:41.370> connected<00:03:41.639> to

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
the camera will need to be connected to

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.379 
the camera will need to be connected to
a<00:03:42.000> USB<00:03:42.359> port<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:43.019> recharge<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.400> HX<00:03:44.729> a<00:03:44.879> 100
