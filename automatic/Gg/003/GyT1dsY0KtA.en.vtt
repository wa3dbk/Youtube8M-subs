it's<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.760> process<00:00:09.030> called<00:00:09.450> sonoluminescence

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
it's a process called sonoluminescence

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.379 
it's a process called sonoluminescence
the<00:00:12.809> first<00:00:13.080> time<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> saw<00:00:13.740> sonoluminescence

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
the first time I saw sonoluminescence

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.050 
the first time I saw sonoluminescence
was<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.599> darkened<00:00:16.049> room<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:18.949> was<00:00:20.060> transfixed

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
was in a darkened room I was transfixed

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
was in a darkened room I was transfixed
to<00:00:21.510> look<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.289> Sun<00:00:23.240> spherical<00:00:24.590> flask<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.050 
to look at the Sun spherical flask of
fluid<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> you'd<00:00:29.010> look<00:00:29.130> into<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> center<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
fluid and you'd look into the center and

fluid and you'd look into the center and
in<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> center<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.480> glowing<00:00:33.480> blue<00:00:34.290> purple

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
in the center see a glowing blue purple

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
in the center see a glowing blue purple
light<00:00:35.690> which<00:00:36.690> could<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.960> seen<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
light which could be seen with the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.010 
light which could be seen with the
unaided<00:00:37.649> eye

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:51.720 

it<00:00:42.350> looked<00:00:42.740> like<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.190> star<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.790> heavens

Seth<00:00:52.540> Putterman<00:00:52.930> called<00:00:53.380> it<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:54.160> star<00:00:54.520> in<00:00:54.820> a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
Seth Putterman called it the star in a

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.600 
Seth Putterman called it the star in a
jar<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.540> tiny<00:00:56.500> spot<00:00:56.890> of<00:00:57.100> bright<00:00:57.340> light

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
wave is passed through a small bubble

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.910

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.190 
inside a flask of liquid and this sound
wave<00:01:15.190> makes<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.150> bubble<00:01:16.479> do<00:01:16.750> something

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
wave makes the bubble do something

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.640 
wave makes the bubble do something
remarkable<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:19.150> it<00:01:19.450> expands

remarkable first it expands

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.000 
remarkable first it expands
then<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.730> collapses<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:24.650> collapse

then it collapses and this collapse

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.550 
then it collapses and this collapse
happened<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:25.820> violently<00:01:26.480> that<00:01:27.320> vapor

if so this would be something truly

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.860 
if so this would be something truly
amazing<00:03:02.599> I<00:03:03.340> simply<00:03:04.340> bombard<00:03:04.879> in<00:03:05.060> tiny<00:03:05.420> bubbles
