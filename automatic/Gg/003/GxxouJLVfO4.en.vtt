00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.600
 animals as therapists there is something 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.639
 it is an older person alone 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 it better that he is with a dog 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 go for a walk or a guinea pig 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.040
 caresses something really shines there 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 to be on it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.119
 That's why animals are welcome in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.699
 old people's homes and for some time 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 also in geriatric clinics where one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.470
 deals with gerontology in the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 upper bavarian geriatric center neuburg 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.699
 At the Danube, animals will be in the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.740
 used ergotherapy 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.710
 They divert the patients from theirs 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.070
 hurt and motivate them to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.070
 move 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.359
 Therapy animals are friends 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.159
 playmates and conversation partners 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.589
 they give comfort to boost the 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.239
 Joie de vivre you just have fun 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.659
 the blood pressure and the heart rate 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.429
 be reduced this demonstrably prevents 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.159
 Cardiovascular diseases before 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.320
 because the animals are supplied and contact 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.890
 the patients need to move 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.659
 which in turn is healthy 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.610
 Add to that the fact that 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.289
 especially in the elderly 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 feeling still needed 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.909
 plays a particularly important role 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.490
 you can feel that animal 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.159
 mediate here in the geriatric center 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.740
 neuburg an der donau in upper bavaria 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.229
 animals have been used for several years now 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.590
 therapy in old and sick patients 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 used 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:42.100
 the animal therapy gave birth as such 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.759
 success or results that you do not 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.640
 expected 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.850
 animal and human can be for each other in the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.689
 games develop a relationship 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.549
 the outside rational relationship 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.439
 so develop this pure you are the 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.179
 Feeding the hand I do not know that 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.520
 certainly plays a role but that is 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.020
 not alone but I believe that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.990
 they also feel something for each other 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.060
 can and you have this impression in 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.280
 the therapies very much as well as the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.019
 Animals behave like not at all 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 they are anxious but they are facing 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.819
 are a dog that can be brought 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.650
 that for example at one half 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.269
 the paralyzed people no longer 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.890
 In the situation is a stroke movement 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.799
 to carry out yourself 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.290
 which provokes that he at the 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.959
 Hanging hand under this hand 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.540
 go downstairs and walk slowly 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.579
 that the hand strokes in 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.430
 quotes and thus this 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:40.140
 paralyzed arm an information gives you 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.140
 can not get more by itself 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.640
 Left 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.640
 there 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.350
 At our patients then arrive 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.400
 Let's take it on the next day 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.050
 a founding arch 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.870
 there is then queried what the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.810
 animal-assisted therapy affects whether they 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.340
 Animals like what the animals like 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.020
 you may be afraid of animals 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.300
 and before which ones do you yourself 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.980
 have had pet and good fortune 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.800
 is quite good if you yourself the hand 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.360
 or have a cat then 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.220
 are naturally suitable and allergies 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.720
 Of course we also ask if 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.170
 somehow allergies persist 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 animal hair 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.370
 Animals and carers are special 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.170
 trained the goals and desired 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.680
 successes alternation in everyday life 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.310
 awaken memories and emotions 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.050
 allow feelings and live out 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.500
 self esteem attention and 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.820
 Strengthen concentration and fine motor skills 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.820
 promote skills 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.930
 Yes 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.959
 most of them are down in the 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.850
 past and therefore have insane 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.370
 fear to come again to come again 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.889
 to start running the first one 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.780
 steps and this fear of this stress 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.639
 He can talk about the animals over these 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.919
 Positive distraction taken very well 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.910
 and be characterized are the yes 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.990
 Achieve therapy success faster 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.180
 and just faster a good one 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:51.479
 relationship of trust with the therapist 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:54.030
 and is just getting older 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.580
 the less and less the communication 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.620
 they often hear people worse 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.810
 also language problems as a result of one 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.750
 stroke and all the communication 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.900
 and interaction simply leaves after 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.550
 old and everyone knows here has knows it 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.340
 one talks about constantly 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.220
 with his animals what you tell him 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.260
 his worries his grief it does not matter 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.510
 you can also talk nonsense that it is the 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.880
 animal does not matter it just stops 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.949
 the speech melody and I notice that 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.750
 even with our patients that they completely 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.349
 come quickly into the story that's it 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.349
 also good 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.970
 nurses the other employees of the 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.710
 house the patients of the patients 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.610
 react positively by the bank 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.080
 this type of therapy 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.810
 it also turned out that 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.790
 all ideas or in the man 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.480
 For example, this animal had some kind of animal 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.010
 could transmit the type of infection 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.080
 that the dogs can bite or 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.150
 Guinea pigs could bite 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.340
 So that's about injury in this one 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.870
 could come together 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.580
 that just did not come true 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.260
 that with the miracle is always dangerous 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.540
 but sometimes it really seems like one 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.300
 little wonder if the dog in the room 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.580
 enters and yes the patient's face 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.240
 they laugh they rejoice they radiate 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.040
 one on 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.480
 and that's why I think so 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.060
 often in the media that it's like that 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.650
 It is not really a miracle 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.669
 but it just has a very fast 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.669
 positive effect 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.860
 it is not primarily about that 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.100
 live years but years of life too 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.100
 give
