00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 There the aiea lera hayashi here and today is day 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 the first video here of the channel line of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 background must have seen my 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 main channel the video talking about 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.449
 this new channel my new project right 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.039
 my secondary channel and as I explained 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.390
 on the video that is on the main channel 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 game channel 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.480
 this channel here will be focused 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 exclusively in certain football is not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.910
 about fifa about the fifa match is that it's a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.250
 soccer videogame game is not about 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 That is you will see that in some 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.450
 videos like this for example the people 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.579
 will have background but fifa gameplay 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.930
 certain symbolism to illustrate not 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.129
 stay only my voice 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.450
 while you also did not buy currency in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.430
 field that I intend to acquire soon 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.559
 suddenly I might change the format of the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 channel for blog but every once in a while 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 You see, it was fifa game. 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.430
 to the bottom right like I said I want 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 talk about football real football then 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.229
 If you follow me on twitter, you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.909
 It's on instagram, I do not know. 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.229
 you must have realized that I like 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.479
 so much on my channel 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.159
 main of games is I always brought 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.229
 some soccer videos I've done video 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.030
 for example to comment the draw for 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.009
 world cup draw the draw of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 round of the champions league is 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.740
 when he had the World Cup final between 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.780
 chelsea corinthians I made a video 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.460
 also to comment before the game 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.960
 finally this should already have 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.030
 perceived and noticed that I quite like 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.140
 mainly football 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 International 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 and when I posted soccer videos on the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.070
 main channel is never the one that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 She saw that I imagined and did not want 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 will give more saw but simply I 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 I think I 've created a separate couple just 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.759
 for me to be able to talk about it a channel 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.649
 that I'm sure that whoever 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.270
 subscribe here to see content about the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.250
 football looks better and they managed to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 better distribute and bring content 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.119
 more interesting that I have 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.380
 series ideas that I'm going to bring to 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.270
 this channel that I could not bring 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.939
 to the other channel because taking a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 little the channel's focus know then I'll 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.210
 do everything here in this channel the name of the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.710
 channel is bottom line as you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.000
 could see then I thought that with the name 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.310
 a nice guy 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.799
 the design of the canal was even made 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170
 by victor rigoni of part company 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.430
 sure he did along the canal and rule 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 what we want today 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.329
 using here right I do not know if I will keep 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.519
 but at least for now I 'm going 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.140
 continue to use it over there and the logo 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.730
 I really liked it, it was also made by him. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.810
 I will leave here in the description the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.079
 information for those who want to take a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.870
 conferred on his work, and finally 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.879
 what will have on the frequency channel of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.500
 life let's start talking about it 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.969
 my main channel games channel you 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.980
 know that I have a frequency of one 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.510
 video a day more or less here will not 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.709
 So here is the video frequency will 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.329
 be much smaller 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.909
 not being how much but I believe 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.430
 two or three videos per week 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.019
 right as the channel grew and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.790
 All of a sudden it worked out, I can 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.560
 start to expand this a bit 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.569
 professionalize a little more but the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 principle the channel is nothing more than a 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.650
 channel is secondary even where I go 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.959
 pass the same opinion on some topic 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.400
 that interests me about soccer knows 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.169
 can be a controversial subject can be a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.579
 champions league draw and also the 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.319
 world cup this year has the 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.669
 and it is very likely that in the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.219
 world cup has a frequency of 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.409
 videos greater certain but the frequency 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.030
 will not be very large and already 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.230
 has series projects for the channel 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.359
 also a series that I'm sure 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.760
 that I'm going to do a series of top 10 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.370
 things about football is for example the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.489
 top 10 of the highest paid players in the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.319
 world knows type top 10 is downloads 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.479
 most expensive in the world knows top 10 in 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.180
 General football has only two examples 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.769
 here but will have several top 10 if you guys 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.340
 suggestions even you can 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.379
 leave the comments and but it 's a series 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.419
 I intend to be weekly right 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.120
 another idea that I had in mind 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.040
 creation of a podcast a podcast already for 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.470
 discuss matters with other people 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.299
 controversial about football is this is a 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.609
 a little more project that requires a little 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.220
 more calm a little more than of 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.959
 working out right and I would need to 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.489
 two more people to comment 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.870
 with me one of them i think i already have 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.199
 I would have to pack up yet another 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.849
 person is let's see if it was 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.790
 uncoiling I see I can 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.560
 bring is and no more expensive has no 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.389
 so another planned venue is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.099
 simply a soccer channel for me 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.139
 in my opinion and discuss with you I 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.370
 I really like talking about soccer, do not you? 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.500
 I know that there are many who accompany me and 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.669
 Like it too so I guess it will not be 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.969
 the ideal place for people is able 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.560
 discussing this is about approaches 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.670
 I'm going to approach the national football 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.160
 international football 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.660
 the guy is going to have both teams go 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.340
 make it clear that it will be much more 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.650
 international soccer football 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.360
 national if you also accompany me 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.040
 The video you know that I accompany a lot 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.990
 more international football than 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.630
 national football for a few years now. 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.280
 I've been doing this, national soccer is me. 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.220
 disappoints in many ways the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.050
 a series of factors that make the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.150
 national soccer for me is not so 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.010
 attractive as international football 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.930
 This can suddenly become a subject. 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.240
 for a video for a podcast who knows 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.680
 in the future but will have both know 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.450
 When you have a nice subject for the ball. 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.250
 to approach national football, I'm going 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.500
 approach but the vast majority will be 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.310
 focused I believe in international football 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.780
 right including a video that was me 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.300
 asking a lot in the text on Twitter 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.590
 I am and do what it is about the 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.090
 quarterfinals of champions league will 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.070
 going out on this channel will most likely 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.420
 be the first video channel after 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.490
 this is not the channel's second video 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.010
 should come out very soon be connected 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.420
 the right and i do not think so but that's okay 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.070
 this video that presentation shadow 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.930
 to give you a parameter of how 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.850
 is it going to work that bottom line 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.760
 ok for now it's just me for now 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.110
 no, it's not focused on type blog by 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.910
 encounter you should see some gameplay 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.440
 fifa at the bottom but as time went on 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.820
 passing the channel was growing 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.560
 suddenly I can not professionalize 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.140
 better devote myself a little more this 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.820
 right channel is just one channel 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.770
 secondary that I do for hobby by 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.510
 like to talk about football and power 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.730
 serve on the knee to separate slightly 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.920
 things on my right game channel 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.330
 so that's it if you liked this 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.160
 video is watching and interested 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.080
 by design do not forget to sign up 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.700
 on the channel click the subscribe button 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.010
 so you do not miss the next videos 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.220
 Video should be out tomorrow, maybe tomorrow.

 Many thanks to whoever saw the 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
 video so far many thanks to everyone 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.890
 that has been supporting the project since 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.350
 when I announced on twitter a while ago 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.580
 back in instagram too and hopefully 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.800
 be all right and also has the support 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.750
 in the videos with the laity in the 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.340
 disclosure and everything else then I go 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.200
 staying here if you liked I left the 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.360
 his favorite laxism is inscribed in the 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.130
 channel and more is that then with hugs 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.900
 Everyone is going to expand this a bit 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.880
 professionalize a little more but the 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.120
 principle the channel is nothing more than a 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.120
 channel
