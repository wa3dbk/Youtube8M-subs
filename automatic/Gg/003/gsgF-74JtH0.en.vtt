something that's specific to clubs

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.959 
something that's specific to clubs
because<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> players<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.850> bit

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
because the players are a little bit

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.369 
because the players are a little bit
weird<00:00:51.180> than<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> game<00:00:51.570> promote<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> little

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
weird than the game promote is a little

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.389 
weird than the game promote is a little
bit<00:00:52.469> different<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> these<00:00:53.219> ones

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bit different so all of these ones

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.380 
bit different so all of these ones

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
because I can't decide if this is

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.910 
because I can't decide if this is
actually<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> proper<00:00:57.329> kick-off<00:00:57.629> glitch<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.199> if
