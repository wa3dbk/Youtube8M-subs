six<00:00:25.710> there's<00:00:25.920> some<00:00:26.189> other<00:00:26.340> options<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
six there's some other options but this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.429 
six there's some other options but this
is<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> quick<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.250> easy<00:00:29.840> or<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> way

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
is going to be a quick and easy or a way

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.010 
is going to be a quick and easy or a way
that<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.710> used<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:35.390> as<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.719> hear<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that I used to do it as you can hear it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.000 
that I used to do it as you can hear it
it's<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.510> little<00:00:39.510> reverse<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.710> every

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it's this a little reverse on every

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.770 
it's this a little reverse on every
other<00:00:41.190> clap<00:00:43.940> I'm<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.120> show<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.390> how<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> do

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
other clap I'm gonna show you how to do

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
other clap I'm gonna show you how to do
that<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:48.200> basically<00:00:49.670> I'm<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.789> move<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
that so basically I'm gonna move out of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.709 
that so basically I'm gonna move out of
the<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> now

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
the way so we don't have it now

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.760 
the way so we don't have it now
basically<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:55.350> want<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> do

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
basically what you're gonna want to do

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.939 
basically what you're gonna want to do
is<00:00:56.039> you're<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> go<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> redraw<00:00:57.890> find<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is you're going to go to redraw find a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
is you're going to go to redraw find a
clap<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:00:59.879> gonna<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.300> rid<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
clap that you like I'm gonna get rid of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.219 
clap that you like I'm gonna get rid of
this<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:02.370> sample<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.480> already<00:01:03.719> had<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this this sample that I already had and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.660 
this this sample that I already had and
because<00:01:04.650> we're<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
because we're gonna get to that in a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.570 
because we're gonna get to that in a
second<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.409> get<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> clap<00:01:07.770> sample<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.340> whatever

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
second so get a clap sample or whatever

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.570 
second so get a clap sample or whatever
sampler<00:01:08.939> couldn't<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> with

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
sampler couldn't want to do this with

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.289 
sampler couldn't want to do this with
and<00:01:12.710> you're<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> also<00:01:14.580> open<00:01:15.150> up

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and you're gonna want to also open up

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.630 
and you're gonna want to also open up
that<00:01:15.570> same<00:01:15.960> sample<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:19.009> sample<00:01:20.009> window

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that same sample in the sample window

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.830 
that same sample in the sample window
right<00:01:20.850> next<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.159> we're<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.720> find<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
right next to it so we're gonna find the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
right next to it so we're gonna find the
same<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:26.509> see<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> same<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.310> I'm<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.610> to

same one see it same one I'm gonna go to
edit<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.900> reverse<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:34.650> might

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
edit I'm gonna reverse and you might

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.910 
edit I'm gonna reverse and you might
think<00:01:34.829> well<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:36.210> easy<00:01:36.650> but<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
think well that's it that's easy but a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.249 
think well that's it that's easy but a
lot<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> thing<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.790> fairly<00:01:39.270> important

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
lot of thing that's fairly important

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
lot of thing that's fairly important
that<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> sound<00:01:41.220> good<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> sort

that to make it sound good and it sort
of<00:01:42.590> differs<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.979> type<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> sample<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
of differs on the type of sample that

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
of differs on the type of sample that
you're<00:01:44.700> using<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.420> want<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.869> rid<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> this

you're using we want to get rid of this
main<00:01:47.009> sort<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.399> meat<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> sample<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.659> just

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
main sort of meat of the sample we just

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.100 
main sort of meat of the sample we just
want<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.740> tail<00:01:49.979> part<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.509> I'm

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
want the the tail part of it so I'm

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.039 
want the the tail part of it so I'm
going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> cut<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.299> drop

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
going to cut from right here on and drop

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.649 
going to cut from right here on and drop
that<00:01:55.399> getting<00:01:56.399> rid<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> whole<00:01:57.149> front<00:01:57.479> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that getting rid of the whole front of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.560 
that getting rid of the whole front of
that<00:01:57.780> clap<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.189> had<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.490> sound<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
that clap so we just had this sound and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.940 
that clap so we just had this sound and
that's<00:02:03.570> really<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
that's really what we want for this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.560 
that's really what we want for this
effect

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
effect

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.650 
effect
so<00:02:06.900> I'm<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.890> ahead<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.420> also<00:02:09.420> name

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so I'm going to go ahead and also name

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.170 
so I'm going to go ahead and also name
this<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.110> rev<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:13.350> doesn't<00:02:13.940> entirely<00:02:14.940> matter

this as rev it doesn't entirely matter
at<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.450> point<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.380> will<00:02:16.710> want<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.070> rename

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
at this point but we will want to rename

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
at this point but we will want to rename
it<00:02:17.730> eventually<00:02:18.950> I'll<00:02:19.950> show<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.480> can

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
it eventually I'll show you you can

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.660 
it eventually I'll show you you can
explain<00:02:21.870> why<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.200> second<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.280> when<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.550> do

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
explain why in a second so when you do

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.990 
explain why in a second so when you do
that<00:02:23.880> you'll<00:02:24.540> notice<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.320> okay<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.730> good

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that you'll notice that okay that's good

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300 
that you'll notice that okay that's good
but<00:02:27.630> also<00:02:28.080> our<00:02:28.410> original<00:02:28.680> sample<00:02:29.010> will<00:02:29.100> cut

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
but also our original sample will cut

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.170 
but also our original sample will cut
change<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.730> clap

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
change to clap

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.310 
change to clap
Oh<00:02:30.210> 6/rev<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:32.100> not<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.490> want<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
Oh 6/rev it's not what we want and so

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.370 
Oh 6/rev it's not what we want and so
instead<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.410> now<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.270> didn't<00:02:39.810> rename<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
instead so now if we didn't rename it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.320 
instead so now if we didn't rename it
then<00:02:40.740> we'd<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.250> them<00:02:41.430> both<00:02:41.610> clapping<00:02:42.090> six

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
then we'd have them both clapping six

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.140 
then we'd have them both clapping six
and<00:02:42.570> it'd<00:02:43.050> be<00:02:43.080> really<00:02:43.230> confusing<00:02:43.890> because

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and it'd be really confusing because

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.250 
and it'd be really confusing because
even<00:02:45.150> though<00:02:45.240> we<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> reversed<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.050> it's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
even though we have a reversed one it's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.430 
even though we have a reversed one it's
still<00:02:46.530> named<00:02:46.770> original<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:48.780> since<00:02:49.200> we

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
still named original but since we

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.700 
still named original but since we
remember<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.460> rename<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.410> all<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.560> to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
remember to rename this all you have to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.400 
remember to rename this all you have to
do<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.070> select<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.120> choose<00:02:54.870> our<00:02:55.080> original

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
do is select this choose our original

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.449 
do is select this choose our original
sample<00:02:55.770> again<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.300> then<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.280> our

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
sample again and then we have our

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.160 
sample again and then we have our
forward<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.690> Reverse<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.520> now<00:03:02.880> I'm<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.170> go

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
forward in Reverse so now I'm gonna go

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.980 
forward in Reverse so now I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.530> put<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.990> sequencing

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
ahead and put this in the sequencing

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.100 
ahead and put this in the sequencing
window<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:09.560> for<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.600> example<00:03:12.600> you're

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
window over here for this example you're

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.720 
window over here for this example you're
gonna<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:13.950> sequencing<00:03:14.430> window

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
gonna have to use this sequencing window

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.510 
gonna have to use this sequencing window
you<00:03:15.150> can't<00:03:15.420> really<00:03:15.630> use<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.310> not

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
you can't really use this because not

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.990 
you can't really use this because not
accurate<00:03:17.970> enough<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.410> I'll<00:03:19.830> often<00:03:20.130> program

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
accurate enough but I'll often program

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.250 
accurate enough but I'll often program
my<00:03:21.209> beats<00:03:21.510> initially<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.630> redrump<00:03:24.959> so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
my beats initially in in the redrump so

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.740 
my beats initially in in the redrump so
I'll<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.370> right<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.570> gonna

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I'll just do that right now so I'm gonna

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.940 
I'll just do that right now so I'm gonna
have<00:03:27.959> my<00:03:28.370> clap<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.700> 5<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.030> 13<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.890> I'm

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
have my clap on the 5 and 13 and I'm

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.920 
have my clap on the 5 and 13 and I'm
gonna<00:03:32.100> go<00:03:32.430> ahead<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.700> right-click<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.720> click

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
gonna go ahead and right-click and click

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.130 
gonna go ahead and right-click and click
copy<00:03:34.440> pen<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.890> track<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.540> gonna<00:03:36.690> bring

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
copy pen to track that it's gonna bring

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.570 
copy pen to track that it's gonna bring
that<00:03:38.209> 5<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.239> 13<00:03:39.720> into<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.350> signature<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.459> now

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
that 5 and 13 into this signature so now

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.759 
that 5 and 13 into this signature so now
I<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.910> my<00:03:45.450> normal<00:03:45.780> sample<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.290> now<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.440> want

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
I have my normal sample and now I want

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.360 
I have my normal sample and now I want
to<00:03:46.830> add<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.130> my<00:03:47.280> reverse<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:49.110> here's<00:03:49.320> my<00:03:49.500> normal

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
to add in my reverse so here's my normal

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.180 
to add in my reverse so here's my normal
stamp<00:03:50.580> normal<00:03:51.209> clap<00:03:51.420> lane<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:53.040> above

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
stamp normal clap lane and right above

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.810 
stamp normal clap lane and right above
it<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.970> my<00:03:54.150> reverse<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:55.769> I'm<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.670> gonna

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
it is my reverse so I'm just gonna

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.229 
it is my reverse so I'm just gonna
eyeball<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.890> throw<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> reverse<00:03:59.670> in<00:04:00.060> there

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
eyeball it and throw a reverse in there

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.640 
eyeball it and throw a reverse in there
see<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.080> sounds<00:04:01.320> like<00:04:03.230> it's<00:04:04.230> not<00:04:04.410> quite

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
see what it sounds like it's not quite

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.900 
see what it sounds like it's not quite
lined<00:04:04.830> up<00:04:05.010> right<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.489> I'm<00:04:05.580> going<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.760> adjust

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
lined up right so I'm going to adjust

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.250 
lined up right so I'm going to adjust
the<00:04:06.239> position<00:04:08.120> that's<00:04:09.120> pretty<00:04:09.330> close<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:10.080> can

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
the position that's pretty close you can

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.250 
the position that's pretty close you can
count<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:11.550> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
count it in with the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.070 
count it in with the
as<00:04:12.500> dragging<00:04:13.489> up<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.700> down<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.239> this<00:04:14.599> sort

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
as dragging up and down on the this sort

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.009 
as dragging up and down on the this sort
of<00:04:15.230> sent<00:04:15.530> value<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:17.510> really<00:04:17.750> close

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
of sent value to get it really close

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.710 
of sent value to get it really close
that<00:04:20.979> sounds<00:04:21.979> pretty<00:04:22.100> good<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:23.210> now<00:04:23.389> I'm<00:04:23.510> just

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
that sounds pretty good and now I'm just

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.170 
that sounds pretty good and now I'm just
gonna<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:24.110> ahead<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.470> drag<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.520> each<00:04:25.940> of

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
gonna go ahead and drag it to each of

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.570 
gonna go ahead and drag it to each of
the<00:04:26.419> other<00:04:27.320> claps<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.949> I<00:04:27.979> want<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.340> play<00:04:28.520> so

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
the other claps that I want to play so

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:41.469 
the other claps that I want to play so
now<00:04:28.880> all<00:04:29.060> we<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.699> actually<00:04:41.060> want

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
now all we have this and I actually want

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.600 
now all we have this and I actually want
to<00:04:41.539> just<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.960> slightly<00:04:42.260> back<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:42.889> little<00:04:43.250> bit<00:04:43.430> so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
to just a slightly back a little bit so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.730 
to just a slightly back a little bit so
