powered via the USB of the computer it's
attached<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.149> unfortunately<00:01:52.149> an<00:01:52.299> iPad

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
attached to and unfortunately an iPad

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.539 
attached to and unfortunately an iPad
just<00:01:52.869> doesn't<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.320> enough<00:01:53.530> power<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:54.070> run<00:01:54.369> it

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
just doesn't have enough power to run it

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.139 
just doesn't have enough power to run it
so<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.299> use<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.689> balcony<00:01:56.109> our<00:01:56.619> USB<00:01:57.159> hub<00:01:57.670> to

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
so I use a balcony our USB hub to

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.380 
so I use a balcony our USB hub to
provide<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.630> power<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.289> fast-track<00:01:59.619> pro

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
provide the power to the fast-track pro

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.539 
provide the power to the fast-track pro
the<00:02:01.390> USB<00:02:01.840> signal<00:02:02.289> passes<00:02:02.740> through<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.130> hub<00:02:03.280> on

the USB signal passes through the hub on
its<00:02:03.759> way<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.359> my<00:02:04.509> iPad<00:02:04.960> where<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.799> use<00:02:06.100> some
