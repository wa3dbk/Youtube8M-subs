00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:10.340
 Yes Dorchester Honchi is the town Kaedeke this time impressed not informed Mars 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:13.550
 I think I want to do part 2 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.400
 How forward I leaned forward 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.600
 Nde the i Well story was chucking's gonna be cleared 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:27.760
 It looks like there are four abilities 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 Hey Are you okay? I'd got to know the other all 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.350
 This time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.380
 Even though I'm part 2 I've got all the clunks, but I hope to introduce the sound 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:44.470
 It is the second ability It is a sound of the second ability 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:47.860
 Yes Well say what kind of ability and and Well too much smoke 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.790
 It does n't change so much now, but it is this one 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 Well the color of this when it flies etc 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.940
 In this way the movement becomes smooth in the garden 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.170
 A few afterimage remains 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.509
 It is that this with smoke and different Toko is would climb the wall when grade 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.509
 Movement is fast , even in the ability 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.760
 Very fast 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.270
 eh 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 Well how to attack does not change well 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.380
 Police attack is a little chain 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.210
 Stand and write a little 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 I 'm supposed to live in Tonfa 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.180
 It doesn't change so well, but the speed also doesn't change 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:39.470
 Well, long-range attacks are under the jurisdiction of the laser . 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:43.940
 What is different from march mourning is that it is a bit slow that the continuous drama is somewhat 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.310
 8 And those who are missiles 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.880
 It is a feeling and Khan 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.070
 I am a Dokan 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 Well this time there is no special move but I will come in Yes 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.340
 Well, especially, don't you? 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.740
 Even though we introduce 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.110
 Because it is not only to fight with the enemy 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.750
 Well then if you fight with it, you may be able to do it on your own. 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.940
 It Can I mean 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.580
 If you can learn Japanese 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.580
 So posting of this enemy conquered Well 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.450
 Let's get along 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.450
 Introduction to Ann Shokai 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.250
 There are many enemies 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.870
 Then I feel like going to break that alley 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.870
 Go 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.310
 I can do it 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.060
 No 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.740
 I'm talking about a story but I don't know English 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.690
 I have no choice but to guess 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:07.890
 It's about this kind of thing 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.890
 It is okay to not understand English anymore what without it anymore if we grab 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.870
 I think that I will buy Japanese version 6 hook already 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.670
 May 22nd 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.830
 Be angry 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.170
 This is fine now and next time 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.220
 I bought this time because I wanted to enjoy the street 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:36.910
 It's not a story Action decline just because I just wanted to do it 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.910
 I want to enjoy the story 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.560
 Masu trick to easily 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.320
 Dirt does 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.010
 Well then I see this 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.200
 I wo n't run away 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.200
 I will run away if I do it 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.910
 Good 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.310
 I like it that I have left after attacking I like this 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.549
 Follow 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.299
 While wearing a coat while raising the touch pad on this 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.120
 With the shooting button 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.120
 Mostly back and Khan 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.930
 I think this base is probably overkilled by this 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.850
 I love Hamada. 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.850
 I think this is no longer a base 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.770
 There is no array of Yabe Neon 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.770
 A little bit first 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.750
 When 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.080
 Yeah Well se from, such as billboards that use this kind of fluorescent lamp 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.990
 About conversion of ability 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:14.889
 I mean taking the absorption of that we want to use ability 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.150
 If you want to use wood, from this smoke 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.110
 I have no choice but to convert 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.300
 It'd already impossible to say freely convert 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.310
 Yes 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.310
 And if you want to put on it again 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.690
 Story: It is already almost ready to use this 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.560
 It is a well-balanced arrangement 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:46.220
 Yes So this time around here 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.220
 Thank you for watching you want to end introduction of neon
