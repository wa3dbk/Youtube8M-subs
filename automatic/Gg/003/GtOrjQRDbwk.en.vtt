00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
times what it cost to make them on my

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
times what it cost to make them on my
server<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> an<00:00:45.809> insane<00:00:46.110> profit<00:00:46.469> margin

and we'll look at huge citrine's which
are<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.740> cheap<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.640> server<00:01:21.470> like<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
are really cheap on my server like a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.760 
are really cheap on my server like a
gold<00:01:22.890> /<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.549> dark<00:01:24.299> jade<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
gold / and dark jade which i think is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.999 
gold / and dark jade which i think is
even<00:01:26.009> cheaper<00:01:26.549> let's<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.829> okay<00:01:28.829> they're

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
even cheaper let's see here okay they're

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
even cheaper let's see here okay they're
less<00:01:29.159> than<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> gold<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.810> average<00:01:31.200> maybe

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
less than a gold so it on average maybe

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
less than a gold so it on average maybe
like<00:01:31.710> 10<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> 15<00:01:32.340> gold<00:01:32.490> per<00:01:32.820> se<00:01:33.119> diamond<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> if

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
like 10 to 15 gold per se diamond and if

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780 
like 10 to 15 gold per se diamond and if
you<00:01:33.869> proc<00:01:34.140> more<00:01:34.409> you're<00:01:34.920> essentially<00:01:35.400> like

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you proc more you're essentially like

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.780 
you proc more you're essentially like
doubling<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.799> profit<00:01:38.430> rate<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> pretty

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
doubling it so the profit rate is pretty

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
doubling it so the profit rate is pretty
insane<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.900> I'll<00:01:39.990> show<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> prove

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
insane and I'll show you just to prove

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.639 
insane and I'll show you just to prove
like<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.670> much<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:42.000> actually<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.390> for

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
like how much they actually go for

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
like how much they actually go for

now so what you do is you you buy one of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.490 
now so what you do is you you buy one of

sell them on the age and you make

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.780 
sell them on the age and you make
ridiculous<00:02:45.120> profit<00:02:45.840> off<00:02:45.960> them<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.670> know

ridiculous profit off them and you know

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.610 
ridiculous profit off them and you know
it's<00:02:48.000> pretty<00:02:48.180> foolproof<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.470> worst

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it's pretty foolproof you know the worst

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.410 
it's pretty foolproof you know the worst
the<00:02:49.920> worst<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.340> would<00:02:50.490> do<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.090> I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the worst that you would do is like I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.030 
the worst that you would do is like I
don't<00:02:51.960> know<00:02:52.110> probably<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.530> triple

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
don't know probably like triple

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.730 
don't know probably like triple
quadruple<00:02:53.880> like<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:55.200> pretty<00:02:55.440> foolproof

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
quadruple like it it's pretty foolproof

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.400 
quadruple like it it's pretty foolproof
so<00:02:56.610> give<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.210> shot<00:02:57.390> I'm<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:57.780> server<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
so give it a shot I'm your server and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.060 
so give it a shot I'm your server and
see<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.800> works<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:01.070> basically
