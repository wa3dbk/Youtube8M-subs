00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hey guys that's the third video and I

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.420 
hey guys that's the third video and I
just<00:00:04.080> want<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.319> demonstrate<00:00:04.500> how<00:00:05.370> the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
just want to demonstrate how the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.670 
just want to demonstrate how the
helicopter<00:00:06.390> behaves<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.170> bench<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.620> just

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
helicopter behaves in the bench and just

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.580 
helicopter behaves in the bench and just
like<00:00:07.980> basically<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.900> test<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.050> model<00:00:10.349> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
like basically how to test the model and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.379 
like basically how to test the model and
make<00:00:11.070> sure<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.429> it's<00:00:11.670> doing<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.240> right

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
make sure that it's doing the right

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.410 
make sure that it's doing the right
thing<00:00:12.950> so<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.219> I'm<00:00:14.280> gonna<00:00:14.400> show<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.940> how

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
thing so what I'm gonna show is how

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.220 
thing so what I'm gonna show is how
bail-out<00:00:15.780> works<00:00:16.430> how<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> arm<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.930> then

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
bail-out works how I arm it and then

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.859 
bail-out works how I arm it and then
also<00:00:19.920> how<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> set<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.029> Idol<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.480> bailout

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
also how to set up this Idol on bailout

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.529 
also how to set up this Idol on bailout
so<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:22.859> low<00:00:23.340> RPM<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> head

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so you have a really low RPM on the head

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900 
so you have a really low RPM on the head
and<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.740> make<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.039> bailouts<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> bit

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
and you can make your bailouts a bit

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.000 
and you can make your bailouts a bit
smoother<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.529> gonna<00:00:28.650> go<00:00:28.769> ahead<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
smoother so first I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.640 
smoother so first I'm gonna go ahead and
spool<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.779> gonna<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:31.560> ahead

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
spool up here so I'm just gonna go ahead

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.250 
spool up here so I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:00:31.920> flick<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> hold<00:00:32.870> now<00:00:33.870> remember

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and flick out a hold now remember

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.229 
and flick out a hold now remember
there's<00:00:34.860> no<00:00:34.980> load<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> head<00:00:35.579> right<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:35.880> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
there's no load on the head right now so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
there's no load on the head right now so
the<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> governor's<00:00:37.620> work<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.190> no<00:00:38.340> load

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the way a governor's work with no load

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
the way a governor's work with no load
they<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.899> funky<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.320> bench

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
they can be kind of funky on the bench

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.850 
they can be kind of funky on the bench
where<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.270> more<00:00:42.270> over-speeding<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:43.469> they

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
where you see more over-speeding or they

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.260 
where you see more over-speeding or they
can<00:00:44.010> act<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.250> they're<00:00:44.520> very<00:00:44.760> slow<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
can act like they're very slow and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
can act like they're very slow and
unresponsive<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:47.129> normal

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
unresponsive this is actually normal

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.569 
unresponsive this is actually normal
without<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.660> loading<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.070> they

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
without the the loading they don't they

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
without the the loading they don't they
don't<00:00:50.610> quite<00:00:50.910> work<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.320> bench<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
don't quite work right on the bench so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.619 
don't quite work right on the bench so
sometimes<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> play<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> little

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
sometimes you got to play with a little

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.229 
sometimes you got to play with a little
to<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.020> behave<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> expect<00:00:55.949> so

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
to get to behave the way you expect so

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.610 
to get to behave the way you expect so
it'll<00:00:57.239> probably<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.930> speed<00:00:58.170> quite<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> bit

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it'll probably over speed quite a bit

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
it'll probably over speed quite a bit
here<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> pull<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.699> let's<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.390> what

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
here when I pull up let's see what

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.310 
here when I pull up let's see what
happens

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.870 

so<00:01:09.740> we're<00:01:09.920> shooting<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.250> bit

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.389 

okay<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.689> goes<00:01:15.899> stops<00:01:16.770> letting<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> settle

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
okay there goes stops letting it settle

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.660 
okay there goes stops letting it settle
into<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.789> rpm<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.869> 2200<00:01:21.869> rpm

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
into this rpm here so this is a 2200 rpm

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.819 
into this rpm here so this is a 2200 rpm
okay<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.780> I'll<00:01:24.899> do<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.200> I'll<00:01:25.500> arm

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
okay and then what I'll do is I'll arm

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.399 
okay and then what I'll do is I'll arm
my<00:01:26.039> bail<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> pull<00:01:27.110> pull<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> switch

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
my bail out so I pull pull the switch

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
my bail out so I pull pull the switch
down<00:01:28.850> okay<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.200> hit<00:01:31.320> old<00:01:32.179> okay<00:01:33.179> so<00:01:34.079> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
down okay and then I hit old okay so you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.760 
down okay and then I hit old okay so you
see<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:35.569> you<00:01:36.569> know<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.869> didn't<00:01:37.170> cut<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.500> right

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
see how you know it didn't cut off right

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
see how you know it didn't cut off right
away<00:01:37.939> or<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.149> kind<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.390> slowly<00:01:39.750> turning<00:01:40.350> off

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
away or just kind of slowly turning off

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.719 
away or just kind of slowly turning off
this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.429> we<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.700> have

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
this is actually because we don't have

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.340 
this is actually because we don't have
loaded<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.600> head<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.110> don't

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
loaded on the head right now we don't

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.740 
loaded on the head right now we don't
have<00:01:43.439> blades<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.819> it<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:44.970> very<00:01:45.149> slow<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have blades and so it was very slow so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:56.730 
have blades and so it was very slow so
let<00:01:45.840> me<00:01:45.899> pull<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.110> again

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.469 

you'll<00:01:57.340> review<00:01:57.759> nurse

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.969 

here<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.789> pastry<00:02:02.789> compensation<00:02:03.479> here

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
here the pastry compensation here

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.380 
here the pastry compensation here
abnormal

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.600 

okay<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.660> hit<00:02:09.899> holding<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:11.400> he

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
okay so I just hit holding in this he

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.370 
okay so I just hit holding in this he
was<00:02:11.640> slow<00:02:11.970> again<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.110> gonna<00:02:13.200> do

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
was slow again because what I'm gonna do

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.810 
was slow again because what I'm gonna do
this<00:02:13.530> time<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.770> I'm<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.070> gonna<00:02:14.250> flick<00:02:14.640> out

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
this time is I'm just gonna flick out

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.560 
this time is I'm just gonna flick out
and<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.900> gonna<00:02:16.050> spool<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:17.240> see<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.420> know

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
and it's gonna spool up see if you know

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.210 
and it's gonna spool up see if you know
it's<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.080> bailout<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.740> wasn't<00:02:20.010> fast

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
it's in bailout but it wasn't fast

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:31.240 
it's in bailout but it wasn't fast
that's<00:02:20.520> because<00:02:21.140> it's<00:02:22.140> not<00:02:22.260> behaving<00:02:22.530> right

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.680 

okay<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.090> actually<00:02:35.210> bailed

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
okay so now you see it actually bailed

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.900 
okay so now you see it actually bailed
out<00:02:35.930> correctly<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.160> don't<00:02:37.370> worry<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.610> mean

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
out correctly and don't worry I mean

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.280 
out correctly and don't worry I mean
this<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.150> kind<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.420> funky<00:02:38.720> behavior<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
this is kind of funky behavior and the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.430 
this is kind of funky behavior and the
bench<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.680> normal<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.080> look<00:02:42.110> at<00:02:42.350> my

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
bench is normal so now if you look at my

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.090 
bench is normal so now if you look at my
radio<00:02:43.210> I'm<00:02:44.210> in<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.450> mix<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.800> adjust

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
radio I'm in the mix and I can adjust

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.950 
radio I'm in the mix and I can adjust
this<00:02:46.870> rate<00:02:47.870> mix<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:49.490> adjust<00:02:50.390> my<00:02:50.540> idle<00:02:50.870> on

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
this rate mix to adjust my idle on

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.530 
this rate mix to adjust my idle on
bailout<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:52.210> here's<00:02:53.210> -<00:02:53.600> 19<00:02:54.070> -<00:02:55.070> 20<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.420> can

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
bailout so here's - 19 - 20 so I can

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.300 
bailout so here's - 19 - 20 so I can
kind<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.750> pick<00:02:56.960> what<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.410> want<00:02:57.470> my<00:02:57.710> aisle<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.130> be

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
kind of pick what I want my aisle to be

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.050 
kind of pick what I want my aisle to be
60<00:02:59.180> right<00:02:59.270> here<00:02:59.390> it's<00:02:59.480> been<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.870> faster

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
60 right here it's been a little faster

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.300 
60 right here it's been a little faster
so<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.270> keep<00:03:02.390> going<00:03:02.420> faster<00:03:03.020> or<00:03:03.050> slower

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
so I can keep going faster or slower

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.660 
so I can keep going faster or slower
this<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.940> about<00:03:05.230> 22<00:03:06.230> percent<00:03:06.440> -<00:03:07.310> 22

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
this is this is about 22 percent - 22

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.210 
this is this is about 22 percent - 22
percent<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.530> about<00:03:09.740> what<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.950> like

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
percent and this is about what I like

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.880 
percent and this is about what I like
for<00:03:10.370> my<00:03:10.430> idle<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.850> bailout<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.650> it's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
for my idle on bailout so I see it's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.190 
for my idle on bailout so I see it's
just<00:03:12.920> spinning<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.400> little<00:03:13.520> bit<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.810> now<00:03:15.020> watch

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
just spinning a little bit and now watch

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.020 
just spinning a little bit and now watch
when<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.470> bail<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.280> quickly<00:03:16.730> go<00:03:16.850> up

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
when I bail out you see it quickly go up

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.310 
when I bail out you see it quickly go up
a<00:03:18.820> little<00:03:19.820> over<00:03:19.970> speeding<00:03:20.300> on<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.570> excuse

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
a little over speeding on that excuse

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.850 
a little over speeding on that excuse
there's<00:03:21.500> no<00:03:21.590> load<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:24.170> then<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.410> can<00:03:24.530> flick<00:03:24.740> out

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
there's no load and then I can flick out

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.330 
there's no load and then I can flick out
again<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:26.480> now<00:03:26.660> I'm<00:03:27.080> back<00:03:27.230> into<00:03:27.470> bailout

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
again and now I'm back into bailout

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.880 
again and now I'm back into bailout
bailout<00:03:28.459> mode<00:03:30.760> flick<00:03:31.760> out<00:03:31.910> again<00:03:32.830> okay

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
bailout mode flick out again okay

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.100 
bailout mode flick out again okay
now<00:03:35.400> when<00:03:35.550> I'm<00:03:35.670> done<00:03:35.820> with<00:03:36.330> bailout<00:03:36.720> mode<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
now when I'm done with bailout mode I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.780 
now when I'm done with bailout mode I
can<00:03:37.260> flick<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.710> back<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.250> white<00:03:38.430> setup

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
can flick this back in this white setup

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.750 
can flick this back in this white setup
one<00:03:39.140> kill<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:43.350> see<00:03:43.560> he<00:03:43.620> died<00:03:43.830> okay<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.430> now

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
one kill it you see he died okay so now

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.730 
one kill it you see he died okay so now
it's<00:03:45.210> safe<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.630> go<00:03:45.750> back<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:46.230> normal<00:03:46.530> soft

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
it's safe to go back into normal soft

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.490 
it's safe to go back into normal soft
start<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.630> know<00:03:48.720> there's<00:03:48.960> a<00:03:49.020> full<00:03:49.200> soft

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
start so you know there's a full soft

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.040 
start so you know there's a full soft
start<00:03:50.870> okay

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
start okay

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.110 
start okay
now<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> talked<00:03:53.250> about<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.670> previous<00:03:53.880> video

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
now I talked about in the previous video

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.350 
now I talked about in the previous video
one<00:03:55.020> warning<00:03:55.440> about<00:03:55.640> how<00:03:56.640> this<00:03:56.940> secondary

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
one warning about how this secondary

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.630 
one warning about how this secondary
switch<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.930> cause<00:03:58.080> it<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.290> spool<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.950> when

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
switch can cause it to spool up and when

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.190 
switch can cause it to spool up and when
you<00:04:00.060> flick<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.300> switch<00:04:00.690> what<00:04:00.900> it's<00:04:01.020> going<00:04:01.140> to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
you flick the switch what it's going to

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.140 
you flick the switch what it's going to
do<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> go<00:04:01.800> up<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.130> slow<00:04:02.580> rpm<00:04:02.790> we

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
do is and to go up to that slow rpm we

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.699 
do is and to go up to that slow rpm we
just<00:04:03.360> set<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:03.810> gonna<00:04:03.959> fully<00:04:04.200> spool<00:04:04.530> up

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
just set it's not gonna fully spool up

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.190 
just set it's not gonna fully spool up
but<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.430> just<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.730> note<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.150> caution<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.600> here

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
but it's just a note of caution so here

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.470 
but it's just a note of caution so here
we<00:04:07.290> go<00:04:07.380> I'll<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.650> flip<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.270> okay<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.330> see

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
we go I'll just flip that okay you see

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.150 
we go I'll just flip that okay you see
that<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.200> didn't<00:04:10.440> hit<00:04:10.560> my<00:04:10.590> throttle<00:04:11.010> hold

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
that so I didn't hit my throttle hold

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.910 
that so I didn't hit my throttle hold
I'm<00:04:11.340> still<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.700> throttle<00:04:12.060> hold<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.320> turn<00:04:13.800> on

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
I'm still in throttle hold and I turn on

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.009 
I'm still in throttle hold and I turn on
the<00:04:14.040> mix<00:04:14.250> now<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.330> art<00:04:15.450> p.m.<00:04:15.690> went<00:04:15.900> on

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
the mix now you see the art p.m. went on

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.740 
the mix now you see the art p.m. went on
so<00:04:16.620> if<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.890> happen<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> bump<00:04:17.370> your<00:04:17.519> radio<00:04:17.850> we

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
so if you happen to bump your radio we

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.840 
so if you happen to bump your radio we
hit<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.049> switch<00:04:19.519> right<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.609> don't<00:04:20.700> hit<00:04:20.820> your

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
hit this switch right you don't hit your

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.880 
hit this switch right you don't hit your
whole<00:04:21.060> switch<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.989> could<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.410> could<00:04:22.500> split<00:04:22.740> up

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
whole switch it could it could split up

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.670 
whole switch it could it could split up
like<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> way<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.290> like<00:04:25.530> to

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
like that so this is the way I like to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.440 
like that so this is the way I like to
set<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.860> up<00:04:26.040> because<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.760> like<00:04:27.120> having<00:04:27.390> this

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
set it up because I like having this

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.940 
set it up because I like having this
eidolon<00:04:27.870> bail<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.169> if<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.470> don't<00:04:28.620> want<00:04:28.770> that

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
eidolon bail out if you don't want that

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.740 
eidolon bail out if you don't want that
and<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.730> don't<00:04:29.820> want<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.090> use<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> soft<00:04:30.419> start

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
and you don't want to use a soft start

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.800 
and you don't want to use a soft start
in<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.960> ESC<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:32.220> can<00:04:32.340> go<00:04:32.460> ahead<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.910> do<00:04:33.720> it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
in the ESC you can go ahead and do it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.480 
in the ESC you can go ahead and do it
another<00:04:33.960> way<00:04:34.200> but<00:04:34.230> this<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.430> way

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
another way but this is this is the way

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.900 
another way but this is this is the way
I'm<00:04:35.610> doing<00:04:35.760> it<00:04:36.950> so<00:04:37.950> that's<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.190> problem<00:04:38.400> but

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
I'm doing it so that's a problem but

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.270 
I'm doing it so that's a problem but
just<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.410> need<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.650> be<00:04:40.770> careful<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:41.160> don't

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
just you need to be careful you don't

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.650 
just you need to be careful you don't
hit<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.550> switch<00:04:41.729> accidentally<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.479> like

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
hit that switch accidentally just like

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.760 
hit that switch accidentally just like
the<00:04:42.750> throttle<00:04:43.050> hold<00:04:43.200> switch<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.680> you're

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the throttle hold switch and you're

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.300 
the throttle hold switch and you're
you'll<00:04:44.310> be<00:04:44.430> okay<00:04:45.350> okay<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:46.530> one<00:04:46.919> other<00:04:47.070> thing

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
you'll be okay okay so one other thing

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.010 
you'll be okay okay so one other thing
while<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.880> got<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.090> on<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.270> bench<00:04:48.419> I<00:04:48.690> always

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
while you got it on the bench I always

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.170 
while you got it on the bench I always
test<00:04:49.260> fail-safe<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.979> way<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:50.100> do<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.669> I

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
test fail-safe the way I do that is I

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.060 
test fail-safe the way I do that is I
just<00:04:51.360> shut<00:04:51.479> off<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.780> radio<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.710> here's<00:04:52.919> the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
just shut off the radio so here's the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.180 
just shut off the radio so here's the
radio<00:04:53.340> I'm<00:04:53.610> gonna<00:04:53.790> shut<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.030> off<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.040> want

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
radio I'm gonna shut it off and I want

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.250 
radio I'm gonna shut it off and I want
to<00:04:56.250> make<00:04:56.370> sure<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.810> model<00:04:58.110> doesn't

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
to make sure that the model doesn't

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.130 
to make sure that the model doesn't
spool<00:04:58.560> up<00:04:58.740> okay<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.550> radio<00:04:59.820> is<00:04:59.910> off<00:05:00.140> model

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
spool up okay so the radio is off model

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.230 
spool up okay so the radio is off model
didn't<00:05:01.440> pull<00:05:01.650> up<00:05:01.830> okay<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.640> confirmed<00:05:03.120> that

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
didn't pull up okay so I confirmed that

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.630 
didn't pull up okay so I confirmed that
my<00:05:03.419> failsafe<00:05:03.660> is<00:05:03.990> correct<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.950> I'm<00:05:05.310> ready<00:05:05.550> to

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
my failsafe is correct so I'm ready to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.909 
my failsafe is correct so I'm ready to
go<00:05:05.790> fly<00:05:05.970> that's<00:05:06.240> pretty<00:05:06.450> much<00:05:06.540> it<00:05:06.830> turn<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
go fly that's pretty much it turn the

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.090 
go fly that's pretty much it turn the
radio<00:05:08.010> back<00:05:08.280> on<00:05:11.180> here<00:05:12.180> we<00:05:12.240> go<00:05:12.390> okay<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
radio back on here we go okay so the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.650 
radio back on here we go okay so the
helicopter<00:05:14.700> didn't<00:05:14.940> start<00:05:15.150> up<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.510> my

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
helicopter didn't start up so my

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.600 
helicopter didn't start up so my
failsafe<00:05:15.870> is<00:05:16.200> good<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.440> go<00:05:17.030> okay<00:05:18.060> thanks<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.540> lot
