00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.700 

I<00:01:43.850> think<00:01:44.300> that<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.570> boys<00:01:44.780> came<00:01:45.080> out<00:01:45.320> they<00:01:45.500> knew

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
I think that the boys came out they knew

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.520 
I think that the boys came out they knew
that<00:01:45.950> we<00:01:46.340> had<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.660> come<00:01:47.660> out<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.080> block<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
that we had to come out and block the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.170 
that we had to come out and block the
tackle<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:48.920> always<00:01:49.220> tell<00:01:49.430> them<00:01:49.460> football<00:01:50.150> is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
tackle I always tell them football is

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.910 
tackle I always tell them football is
about<00:01:50.480> blocking<00:01:50.870> attacker<00:01:51.260> who<00:01:51.500> ever<00:01:51.650> blocked

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
about blocking attacker who ever blocked

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.470 
about blocking attacker who ever blocked
the<00:01:52.040> best<00:01:52.220> will<00:01:52.460> talk<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.940> best<00:01:53.120> wins<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.080 
the best will talk to the best wins the
game<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.900> i<00:01:54.440> will<00:01:54.920> say<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.220> these<00:01:55.550> guys<00:01:55.790> came

about<00:01:59.870> winning<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.710> championship
