affected I only had maybe two to three

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
affected I only had maybe two to three
inches<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.980> flooding<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.940> only<00:00:33.120> on

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
inches of flooding down here only on

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.870 
inches of flooding down here only on
this<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.600> side<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> basement<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.880> really

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
this one side of the basement and really

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.790 
this one side of the basement and really
what<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> result<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.530> under

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
what the result of that is the under

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.840 
what the result of that is the under
mounting<00:00:38.100> there<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.399> obviously<00:00:38.730> just

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
mounting there is obviously just

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
mounting there is obviously just
completely<00:00:39.390> ruins<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.050> carpet<00:00:40.410> itself<00:00:40.710> is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
completely ruins the carpet itself is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
completely ruins the carpet itself is
soaked<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.640> through<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.390> has<00:00:42.629> been<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
soaked all the way through it has been a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.660 
soaked all the way through it has been a
few<00:00:43.260> days<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.399> getting

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
few days and it's really not getting

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
few days and it's really not getting
better<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.090> did<00:00:45.989> put<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> dehumidifier<00:00:46.739> down

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
better I did put a dehumidifier down

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.720 
better I did put a dehumidifier down
here

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
here

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360 
here
I<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.600> using<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> few<00:00:49.620> fans<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.219> well

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
I actually was using a few fans as well

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.799 
I actually was using a few fans as well
and<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.030> trying<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> use<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> heater

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and I was really trying to use a heater

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
and I was really trying to use a heater
to<00:00:52.050> try<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.350> soak<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.460> try

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to try and soak up all the water and try

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.860 
to try and soak up all the water and try
and<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.690> made

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and get it out of here but it's made

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
and get it out of here but it's made
almost<00:00:55.379> zero<00:00:55.710> progress<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
almost zero progress because it is a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
almost zero progress because it is a
damp<00:00:57.120> basement<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.750> even<00:00:58.230> opened<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
damp basement I even opened up the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.360 
damp basement I even opened up the
little<00:00:58.949> windows<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.640> have<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
little windows that I do have so in the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
little windows that I do have so in the
result<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> take<00:01:03.809> two

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
result of this is really to take two

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
result of this is really to take two
steps<00:01:04.290> backwards<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.220> take<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.549> step<00:01:05.670> forward

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
steps backwards to take one step forward

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
steps backwards to take one step forward
I<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.900> trim<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> fat<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> cut<00:01:08.460> out

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
I have to trim the fat I have to cut out

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
I have to trim the fat I have to cut out
what's<00:01:08.850> bad<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> cut<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.500> could

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
what's bad I have to cut out what could

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
what's bad I have to cut out what could
eventually<00:01:11.040> cause<00:01:11.490> mold<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.630> don't

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
eventually cause mold because I don't

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.570 
eventually cause mold because I don't
see<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.290> getting<00:01:13.470> any<00:01:13.650> better<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.130> what's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
see this getting any better so what's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.399 
see this getting any better so what's
gonna<00:01:14.700> happen<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.930> room

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
gonna happen I think is this room

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
gonna happen I think is this room
basically<00:01:17.100> I'm<00:01:17.490> taking<00:01:17.640> half<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> carpet<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
basically I'm taking half the carpet and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
basically I'm taking half the carpet and
I'm<00:01:18.720> cutting<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> only

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I'm cutting it out that's the only

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
I'm cutting it out that's the only
answer<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.450> cut<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.930> carpet

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
answer for it is to cut out the carpet

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.260 
answer for it is to cut out the carpet
and<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.560> remove<00:01:22.860> what's<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.340> bad<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
