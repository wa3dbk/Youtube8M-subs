00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.040
 to make our chicken with the little bird 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.880
 What we need of course is a good 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.160
 chicken with salt pepper and look let's go 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.529
 talk then the following chicken 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.579
 normal chicken the choices to pieces 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.470
 you prefer 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.759
 to use I do not normally 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.640
 using the chest to make was a 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.590
 passage because it dries it a bit 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.329
 more than usual what I would say 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.730
 Our business is to make heartburn only from 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.620
 chicken thigh and chicken thigh 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.019
 cut whole bird as it was 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.390
 in the past it was not sold chicken separate 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.350
 so here's the chicken first thing 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.410
 who has to leave the chicken that occurs 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.829
 when you look at the chicken in the pan that the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.440
 good nanÃ¡ where you will temper can not 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.749
 have liquids in the bottom if you have 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.129
 judging the then the chicken has to give 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.890
 a chicken goods and kico 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.720
 according to the size of the cut normally 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.060
 people only make the cut in the middle of the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.119
 frank in the middle of the piece 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.700
 let the chile have half whole reason 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.110
 chest or half of a thigh is not 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.320
 that chicken with the little bird 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:23.259
 I cut two so I see I cut 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.329
 hip here in O O 4 and the thigh that 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.610
 cut into three pieces 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.829
 There are people who cut is smaller but 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.969
 It's bird talking because the chicken 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:38.729
 cut in sizes to pass then 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.729
 or rather small dollar here 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.909
 and that seasoned use salt 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:54.969
 this is the focus will stay long enough 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:58.750
 so you can caprichar in the salt will exaggerate 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:04.170
 can caprichar in the salt otherwise he loses 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.170
 all high fat and pepper 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.330
 only that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.700
 sounds good, marina this chicken 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.950
 no use frank marina it will 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.530
 work and in the pan then the quantity 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.120
 a little salt the pepper is what it is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.430
 important it is at the temperature 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.600
 environment that happens here now we 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.569
 Let's have two frying processes 1 in the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.140
 medium fire removes a chicken leaving the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.420
 fire and other hot on fire then 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.340
 we start by this one the globe 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.489
 here now does not matter if you are okay 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.800
 hot or not whats the first choice 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.590
 then it's going to be a lower game or 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.280
 here is some oil in the pan or 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.330
 for afterwards I complete with oil until 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.250
 cover a future by immersion not 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.830
 good to be a lot of face oil 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.280
 and get very eyes habitats and for a 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:13.620
 little and the guard 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:17.750
 I'll put the chicken in the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.000
 volume of garbage has grown then or now 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:29.160
 for more than one 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.320
 it really gets immersed in fat and 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.530
 there is medium fire 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 This is going to be here 15 minutes. 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.400
 in those ten minutes that happened here 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.450
 frying on the chicken but on very low heat 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.730
 OK 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.610
 ie it is already cooked and oil 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 penetrated into it it succulent that the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.579
 People do take off from the fire. 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.670
 We take it all away and then we'll leave 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.989
 of fire that separates the is and now are 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.930
 seeing the liquids he left here 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.030
 It's going to happen, I'm going to raise the fire. 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.160
 these liquids will evaporate and the fire will 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.010
 team and then I was not all at once was 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.190
 with half then plus one half a 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.200
 the fire will be very hot or the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.570
 fat already stopped swindling ie 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.430
 evaporated all the books have already evaporated 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.560
 the books that are there 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.320
 hot is who does what we will return 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.509
 the focus is the fringe of now go here Ã³ 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.530
 not much that can not exclude the 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.590
 fat 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.509
 although it is already at a temperature 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.139
 difference does not account for half of 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:43.740
 people did the first one and then another 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.509
 half five minutes too and there 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:54.330
 When he gives the point you think he's 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:56.820
 Nice goes out and puts it on paper and he 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.580
 always brings a little fat is 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.160
 putting our little chicken in the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:07.370
 cool now from the side 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:11.789
 our little garlic sauce with your brother 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.780
 very cool combination a dish 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:21.090
 extremely cheap delicious very much 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.099
 99.9 percent of the 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.310
 people because what we want is that 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:30.470
