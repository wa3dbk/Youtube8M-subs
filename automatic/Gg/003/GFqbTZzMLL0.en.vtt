00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.660
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.610
 your house welcome giving color no 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.500
 this second I saw calm the three 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.179
 drunk not for nothing are we for the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.429
 Two girls that we met the year 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.810
 passed in this same stand of zte no 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.970
 we wanted to pass the opportunity to 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.609
 go back to say hello and we are going to present 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.369
 I'm the one who was memo 2 a tablet from 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.410
 Chinese manufacturer 6 inches a paragraph 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.439
 of outstanding cameras let's see what 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.439
 such 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.640
 we started the 12 ld analysis is without a doubt 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.230
 one of the most interesting terminals 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.720
 the star terminal of zte for this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.430
 year like it's a really big terminal 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.440
 or a 6-inch full-blown fablet 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.300
 we will arrive at the screen but as 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.830
 You see, it's really generous, let's go 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.150
 even to take it with the hand so that 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.160
 you see a little the dimensions that it has 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.590
 and do you a little bit the idea of ​​how much 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.200
 with top or occupy the measures 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.290
 concrete are 16 cm high of 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.140
 high 8.3 wide and we find 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.820
 a thickness of only 7.2 the truth 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.380
 that we really liked the effort 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.180
 what the Chinese manufacturer has done 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.220
 try to make your terminals every time 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.500
 We are going to stick a little repasito 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.080
 as always top logo 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.900
 zte speaker front camera of which 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.610
 we'll talk and in the bottom 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.530
 under a generous on a generous frame 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.690
 we found buttons directly 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.970
 integrated on the screen in this case 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.200
 it is not too important since it is 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.630
 a terminal with a pretty screen 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.610
 great we can understand this this 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.140
 left cant functionality let's go to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.460
 find us a volume control like 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.720
 you can appreciate with a black finish 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.760
 sparkly 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.890
 and on the other side we have a 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.930
 chrome finish the unlock button 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.300
 of two slots one of them for the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.360
 slim card and the other one for our 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.430
 microsd card let's turn it around 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.660
 and we found a surprise as 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.310
 we find an imitation of 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.620
 carbon fiber in the shell as 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.480
 we see even if we rotate it as you see 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.090
 it makes a pretty cool effect in light 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.460
 speaker located on the bottom the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.380
 name of the terminal on top 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.360
 a very good camera of photos of which 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.590
 and I'll talk a flash led us 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.780
 we found a micro for cancellation 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.070
 of noise once we 've seen it by 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.570
 outside let's see it inside or know 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.760
 a little bit what is the hardware that 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.260
 incorporates this device in this case 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.060
 scored by qualcomm processors or what 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.060
 which seems to me a success in this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.730
 case is a snapdragon 400 is a quad 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.080
 core accompanied by two gigas of ram for 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.510
 the storage section we are going to 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.950
 count on 16 gigabytes we do again 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.709
 mention what we have in a 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.330
 side for microsd cards the battery 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.890
 it is also quite generous logically 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.500
 a terminal of these dimensions 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.950
 requires a pretty large battery 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.960
 specifically 3200 milliamps in this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.940
 Case is fixed unibody chassis 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.930
 we will be able to remove the details 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.360
 Interesting things you should know 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.440
 logically we have gps we have support 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 cloned 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.280
 we also have infrared to be able 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 give it some use as always 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.460
 functionalities with television 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.930
 mainly and a very detail 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.510
 important that the emphasis is 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.020
 people of zte is that you are prepared to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.460
 connections and networks lte a magnificent 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.200
 news as you are seeing is the 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.720
 versions that I have of operating that 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.580
 incorporates the very same canopy they have taken 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.440
 seriously the people of zte and they give us 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.110
 the possibility of having the last 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.490
 version of the android operating system the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.810
 true that a great news as 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.880
 we are saying let's paste a 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.470
 little review that we should say that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.480
 little bit of pure android left 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.830
 forgetting the typical interface that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.110
 we are used as sum two 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.690
 the manufacturers often customize and 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.670
 this case with a theme as you see that no 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.320
 we find it too attractive 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.060
 I hope that good at least moves 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.790
 pretty good we're going to move the bar 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.170
 of notifications in this case / 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.810
 notifications and by switch control 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.530
 from here we will be able to access a 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.860
 series of controls as always wifi 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.870
 plus quick access to settings 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.000
 which are divided in this case 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.569
 I have the account terminal of the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.700
 system we have a section dedicated to 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.680
 gestures since we will be able to perform 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.480
 different functions we are also going to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.330
 to be able to select when we want 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.430
 turn the device on and off a 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.100
 section for the brightness contrast is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.040
 wallpapers is of more functions and the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.060
 last intended for connectivity 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.280
 we go to the main screen and if 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.079
 we perform a long press 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.669
 we find different options for 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.460
 a part the page do in the part 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.400
 bottom and / widgets available 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.590
 many of them personalized by the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.600
 mark a section for the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.880
 applications and some section for 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.560
 issues from here is to say that we like 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.080
 much this functionality can download 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.880
 different the brief icons and a 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.520
 set aside for the effects that we will 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.710
 allow to modify the transitions 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.750
 between the desk that better than 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.430
 use a sample video to focus 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.320
 to tell you a little about the screen 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.420
 in this case a screen of 6 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.370
 very big we have already said that we are 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.500
 in front of a tablet that does 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.240
 we found with a small handicap 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.960
 in quotation marks and that is only 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.370
 resolution hd to 720 p and in addition to this 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.090
 we have a pixel density by 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.710
 inch 245 logically is not the most 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.510
 high of the market nor much less but 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.880
 good will have to understand the final price 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.770
 of this device a detail that yes 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.810
 that we liked is the protection this 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.610
 device we can count on the 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.700
 standard of standards as is 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.200
 gorilla glass in its version number 3 on 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.000
 section of the cameras of this great 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.010
 modes is one of the most prominent in 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.030
 this case we have a camera of 3 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.220
 megapixel 2.2 focal and a sensor bs and 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.200
 made by sounds the elements 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.230
 It also has auto spotlights the function of 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.760
 record at full hd resolution we are going to 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.990
 switch to the front camera and in this 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.630
 case terms we find by a camera 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.700
 pretty good as you can see in 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.150
 this case is a 5 megapixel camera 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.500
 also with the 2.2 focal sensor that we 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.170
 will also allow you to perform 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.710
 recordings in hd the truth that as 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.650
 we see one 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.150
 pretty good multimedia you have already 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.280
 seen this has been the review that 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.320
 we have given the great mendoza a finished 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.640
 really big 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.740
 we have beautiful images that can 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.500
 accompany a relatively low finish 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.730
 cost as always here there are two things that 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.050
 we have to always ask the audience 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.540
 what do they have to do, for example? 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.850
 such like and share the video 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.100
 I can already die, we see ourselves very 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.480
 soon especially stick a lot of attention 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.310
 to the channel that 'no forum are we 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.310
 uploading many videos with translations 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.060
 nothing 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.039
 well this has been the review we have 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:35.150
 given has noticed the attentive has to be 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.840
 in tension 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.680
 of person 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.270
 Benedict 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.520
 good you are and I promise 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.240
 so being is delaying me and so 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.240
 I can not work 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.050
 not do what you want others 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.050
 the world
