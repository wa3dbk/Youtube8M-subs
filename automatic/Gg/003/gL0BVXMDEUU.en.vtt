00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi my name is val do sul 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.630
 electrician 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.679
 I'm doing the experiment here a mini 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.970
 generator I am using 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:21.180
 the engine here is two printer 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.390
 printers such a panel lamp 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 motorcycle is 12 volts 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.650
 the crimping fan motor is 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 for the refrigerator to be able to make 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 how general become wine here 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.200
 This generator is the source of this printer motor. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.020
 that I know how the generator goes 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.039
 generate power and through these cables that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.430
 positive you will have access to a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.980
 also 12 volts here and I go 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 connect the motor to electrical power 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.900
 to be able to do what we have here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.010
 an attraction in the most 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.320
 the generator to work to make it 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.300
 an experiment on how it worked and 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.190
 let's do a test for you to 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.470
 Observe how the error is working 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.710
 call here ménage now fight here 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.540
 Turned and our note comes here is already 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.210
 I'm going by the parade ground, I'm going 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.470
 now test that the will of what is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.320
 generating 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 I have this energy here in the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.680
 range of 20 and continuous gauge 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.030
 I put it at the wrong time because the sale 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.740
 occurs continuously 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.860
 so let's see how it works 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:49.240
 what we think it is generating 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:51.460
 in ten points and 65 volts 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.710
 so that's why she's a little reddish 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.650
 at that time it is 12 volts 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.440
 then it is from stock exchange generating 10 then 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.170
 she's thinking energy that is 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 arriving at it is low is more sufficient 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.810
 for clarity the luminosity of it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.140
 clear one hundred 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 this energy generator which is a 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.840
 printer motor that I took 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.290
 of the old printer that I had that 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.800
 motor here is the fan motor 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.010
 freeze role of making the attraction just for 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.690
 you will work it up 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.670
 So what do I want to do in the future? 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.860
 I want to do the future, I already made the request 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.239
 some magnets in the free market does not 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.459
 to be able to make this zygene generator 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.530
 it will rotate automatically without the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.890
 need to turn on the power 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.590
 I'm going to do a process here that I do not 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.930
 rotate continuously without stopping 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.930
 work through magnetic emission 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.930
 he will run magnetic medical I will do 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.730
 this operation will not use this ok button 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.909
 so this is the first video 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.010
 it and if you like it that in the video there 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:13.629
 for me it 's me I'll be posting a video 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 after you have made one with the other 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.909
 other traction system that will be 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.430
 through magnetic sound , right? 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.250
 josé through but when I do I will 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.879
 show you there we you see it 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.400
 as you 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.290
 in the beginning, my name is fake 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.459
 maintenance electrician installations 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.530
 electrical 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.629
 I am currently working with 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.370
 employee but at the moment the gap is 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.370
 An experiment for you, thank you.
