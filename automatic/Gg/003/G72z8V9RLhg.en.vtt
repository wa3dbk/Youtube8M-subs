00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.440
 Hello dear friends with you urgently 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.440
 that all these blue will tell and show you how 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.950
 do a cycle call on minecraft without mods 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 and the plugins went so guys like you 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.430
 know in early versions of minecraft but 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 as the earliest such recent who came out 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.489
 just before the maycroft version 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.290
 appeared chipped new mob his name is 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.980
 the guard here and so he looks with one 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.510
 Eyes look like a very little there 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.760
 a bit like a cyclops yes this is part 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 of our soon today I will show you how 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.879
 make one year full cyclops from here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.309
 such a fish guardian so we take 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.929
 command block we put it 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.789
 and enter such a command link to 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.410
 which I will leave in the description necessarily 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.699
 guys put the likes so now 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.859
 activate the command block and we 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.810
 I called myself like this so I forgot 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:13.350
 write a night time site so that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.290
 we could not burn so here and so here 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.780
 he looks like this is either cycles yes 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 I understand he doesn’t even look like a bit 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.090
 on cyclops but something in it is cyclops 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 I do not know how it can be called but 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.690
 a bit like a Cyclops so let's 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 probably see what I am taking now 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.810
 faker kim if at least so you 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.939
 have seen at all what it looks like because 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.930
 probably you are too dark like this 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.500
 Looks like this cycle is about the peak 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.490
 cool zombie with the head of the same guard 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.700
 which I showed you so of course 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.970
 he could be unkind, that is, he is very 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:04.759
 angry and let's try to beat him 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 so he causes and not so little hp and 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.650
 especially because they attack together 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.170
 that is , the guard himself attacks with some kind of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.440
 some sort of electricity haze from 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.500
 eye up telling you honestly real 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.090
 electrically out of my eyes or I don't know 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.510
 can you correct me in the comments well 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 I don't know how else to call 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 also zombies can remove us near 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 so if we are water we will approach it 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.980
 too close then of the zombies from guardian us 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 then we will definitely not embroider 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:45.410
 okay let's space game from 0 so 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.019
 the module is on, let's probably 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.420
 game ru see here this 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.209
 lightning i'm not knowing how else i could like her 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.530
 can still be called but it seems very 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.790
 even at the zipper pancake he beats a month 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.790
 let's probably gamers turn on 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.660
 field so everything is fine so guys now 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.790
 let's go there again by the way 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.820
 worse again we have it beats and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.010
 it even guys are good weapons for the guard 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.080
 it may have come from far to kick its own 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.480
 enemies so we are now in Dima 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.880
 Yes, you see how they set it up like a suluk 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.050
 really how he lives how strange well 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:33.060
 okay let's try to kill and see 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.190
 worse will take place and usually with his head 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.290
 he will run away from us and still us 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.420
 would kill by the way left under this crystal 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.630
 prismarine shard called on but it 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.800
 already with a separate with a separate guard 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.320
 falls to 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.620
 and so it's just two mobs that are merged 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.070
 together and very winch then got 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.590
 two authors of this mechanism and how about 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.610
 even the mechanism but here are just commands 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.120
 need to go all 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.510
 yes mother try to take again 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:11.070
 command block in which I can not enter and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.070
 not for why un in the cage so part of kunu 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.530
 so we enter use the command again 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.450
 and activate the theater love you 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.410
 a map appears and it looks like this 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.540
 take it again show it 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.330
 zombies and with the head of the guard very much 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.070
 guys like a cyclops guys write 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.070
 please in the comments as you do 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.680
 such a cycle whether you like it or not 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.200
 and does it even look like a cycle by for you 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.750
 for me a little bit like 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.700
 Cyclops if his head is spinning 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.890
 and will be direct so forward look a 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.200
 so it becomes real for shelter not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.360
 similar to any cyclops so give 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:02.280
 again try with him square himself on 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:05.340
 light and so game from 0 and so unfair so 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.760
 unfair dude he's good about go go 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.880
 go it's a te amo noticed we eat it 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.310
 finished off in full iron site of 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.870
 anointed with the sword well I don’t know if we will 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.690
 beat him with wood or stone with something 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.180
 we will beat these two for a very long time 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.050
 pounds so guys have to either take a bow 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.740
 either snowballs yes even snowballs up 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.419
 to win them far away what 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.520
 foals such a mechanism 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.790
 not even a mechanism as I said 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.210
 just commands with which you can 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.650
 drain 2 mobs is a zombie from the guards and dreams 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.280

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:52.860
