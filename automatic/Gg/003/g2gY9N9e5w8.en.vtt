00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.779 
say what is you can guess in the
comments<00:01:22.570> but<00:01:22.930> it's<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.409> modern<00:01:23.829> main<00:01:24.340> battle

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789

as<00:02:48.700> nothing<00:02:49.530> Lego<00:02:50.530> things<00:02:51.010> I've<00:02:51.189> been

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
as nothing Lego things I've been

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.679 
as nothing Lego things I've been
building<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:52.150> said<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.970> need<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.120> do<00:02:55.269> review

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
building that said I need to do review

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
building that said I need to do review
this<00:02:56.019> over<00:02:56.379> here<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.340> hang<00:02:57.939> lung<00:02:58.709> tiger

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
this over here it's the hang lung tiger

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.819 
this over here it's the hang lung tiger
one<00:02:59.919> RC<00:03:00.519> tank<00:03:01.230> massive<00:03:02.230> as<00:03:02.349> you<00:03:02.439> can<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.709> it's

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
one RC tank massive as you can see it's

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.940 
one RC tank massive as you can see it's
116<00:03:03.370> scale<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.359> turret<00:03:04.810> rotates<00:03:05.169> gun<00:03:05.500> moves<00:03:05.769> up

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
116 scale so turret rotates gun moves up

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.699 
116 scale so turret rotates gun moves up
and<00:03:06.040> down<00:03:06.299> obviously<00:03:07.299> it<00:03:07.359> can<00:03:07.540> drive<00:03:07.959> forward

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
and down obviously it can drive forward

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.089 
and down obviously it can drive forward
and<00:03:09.220> backwards<00:03:10.180> inside<00:03:10.480> side<00:03:10.689> of<00:03:10.840> course<00:03:11.099> so

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
and backwards inside side of course so

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.770 
and backwards inside side of course so
it's<00:03:12.220> really<00:03:12.340> awesome<00:03:12.519> fires<00:03:13.060> bb's<00:03:13.450> as<00:03:13.629> well

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
it's really awesome fires bb's as well

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.030 
it's really awesome fires bb's as well
the<00:03:14.049> gun<00:03:14.790> that's<00:03:15.790> controller<00:03:16.209> in<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.450> battery

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040

instruction a video for some some other
tank<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.690> don't<00:04:37.870> know<00:04:37.960> I've<00:04:38.170> dug<00:04:38.640> really<00:04:39.640> needs

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
tank I don't know I've dug really needs

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.340 
tank I don't know I've dug really needs
to<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.060> want<00:04:40.210> for<00:04:40.510> simple<00:04:40.810> tanks<00:04:41.110> cuz<00:04:41.230> it's

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
to you want for simple tanks cuz it's

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.630 
to you want for simple tanks cuz it's
actually<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.620> lot<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.830> effort<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.190> take<00:04:42.400> all<00:04:42.550> the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
actually a lot of effort to take all the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.830 
actually a lot of effort to take all the
photos<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.030> then<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.390> get<00:04:43.450> my<00:04:43.570> friends

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
photos and then you get my friends

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.060 
photos and then you get my friends
redditor<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.900> it's<00:04:47.530> going<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.740> be<00:04:47.860> another

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
redditor so it it's going to be another

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.070 
redditor so it it's going to be another
small<00:04:48.490> simple<00:04:48.940> tank<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:49.420> I<00:04:49.510> do<00:04:49.570> another<00:04:49.960> one

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
small simple tank if I do another one

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.160 
small simple tank if I do another one
which<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.530> probably<00:04:50.770> will<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.540> expect<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.080> be

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
which I probably will so expect it to be

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.200 
which I probably will so expect it to be
similar<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.740> MAA<00:04:54.100> 10<00:04:54.490> pounds<00:04:54.880> once<00:04:55.060> your

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
similar to the MAA 10 pounds once your

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.230 
similar to the MAA 10 pounds once your
previously<00:04:55.630> done<00:04:55.870> because<00:04:56.230> it's<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:56.500> easy

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
previously done because it's just easy

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.400 
previously done because it's just easy
and<00:04:58.240> also<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:58.690> easier<00:04:58.930> for<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.200> build

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
and also that is easier for you to build

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
and also that is easier for you to build
because<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.770> requires<00:05:00.160> less<00:05:00.400> part<00:05:02.280> so<00:05:03.280> yeah

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
because it requires less part so yeah

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.730 
because it requires less part so yeah
expect<00:05:04.420> some<00:05:04.810> sort<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.080> instruction<00:05:05.530> video

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
expect some sort of instruction video

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.570 
expect some sort of instruction video
plus<00:05:06.010> reviews<00:05:06.730> videos<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.390> these<00:05:07.480> tanks<00:05:08.580> soon

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
plus reviews videos of these tanks soon

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.320 
plus reviews videos of these tanks soon
and<00:05:10.860> that's<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.700> I<00:05:12.940> think<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.720> other<00:05:14.230> than<00:05:14.410> that

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
and that's it I think so other than that

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.730 
and that's it I think so other than that
