00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.160
 the smart watch of our dreams 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.440
 he is a little know-it-all who lives 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.810
 our doll and sooner rather than later 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.880
 makes it essential in our life 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.260
 when the project in web network seemed 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.270
 that we were very close to that product 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.310
 but showing it is one thing to get 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.890
 balloons as was clear with the energy 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.200
 works the engine presents its new and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.849
 we hope better try that finally 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.619
 arrived in Colombia for long months of his 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.300
 debut in the global market was the 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.399
 most ambitious product of all the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.020
 technological industry at the time its 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.579
 round screen your design and your 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.680
 materials bet you to overcome the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.570
 geek world makes a luxury watch in 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.820
 half of the bunch of ugly gadgets of so 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.920
 solid of its proposal manages to be so 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.050
 human as we pretend dollar let's see 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.940
 engine now designed it built very well 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.519
 he chose the right materials and 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.559
 gave the proper shape on the wrist the 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.210
 Your pulse leather is soft and common and the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.680
 lightweight and durable aluminum box 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.320
 never assured 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.610
 there is only one problem your box can be 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.680
 too big for some users 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.180
 the distinction between clocks of 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.340
 addresses is a woman's hateful 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680
 inaccurate but we can say that the engine 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.540
 of 60 is among the first so it remains 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.560
 out of preference for many already 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.420
 on does not have large 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.590
 inconveniences the screen is fine 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.610
 although its brightness may be insufficient 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.740
 outdoors 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.770
 his tactile response is quite successful 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.140
 includes the xxxii battery delays 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.030
 It lasts between 24 and 36 hours depending on the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.340
 use and recharge more or less two hours 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.840
 The wireless charger is much more 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.360
 nice and easy to use than the other two 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 similar products the only problem is 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.810
 that go overheating a bit later 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.520
 of each recharge 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.680
 about its operation we should say 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.330
 carl edwards is still very clumsy not 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.340
 all applications are well polished 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.440
 and well integrated many do not offer 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.240
 some advantage do not use the watch their 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.890
 measurements are not accurate or do not achieve 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.899
 understand what information relevant to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.450
 the user at every moment others like 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.009
 Several of Opel do it much better 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.380
 google law improved a lot after the arrival 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.640
 of the graphic information Bogota and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.890
 sure that the instruction is better 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.030
 achieved problems that do not stop using 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.250
 the tools that I have all the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 days to have 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.370
 the recognition of boston how 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.230
 works well especially outdoors 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.690
 in addition some of the commands in 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.039
 Spanish are little human another problem 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.120
 is that it gives knowledge of the smartphone of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.190
 the unpresentable 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.260
 sometimes the fault was the signal of the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.570
 light of my cell phone and other connection 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.280
 of the phone and the clock when the app 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.870
 they require information and location 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.820
 slowness is constant and falls are 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 frequent the transversal problem with 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.550
 this product is that it still does not allow 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.740
 interact with the information that 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.300
 interrupt too much to wait for life 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.850
 to give orders and to be aware 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.560
 of more things than ever this defeats the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.209
 sense of the tool instead of 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.760
 simplifying life makes it more complex 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.230
 anyway the 60 motor makes many 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.940
 things well is an advance in the category 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.739
 smart mud all over her 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.350
 design the wall 360 does many things 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.660
 well it is a breakthrough however it follows 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.800
 being a device for geeks can 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.720
 work for those who know 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.310
 can be configured and the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.840
 they understand pretty well but who 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.400
 they seek to consume transparent with a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.400
 Pulse Wristwatch Managers
