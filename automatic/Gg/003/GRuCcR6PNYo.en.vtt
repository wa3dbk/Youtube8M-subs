00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:13.180
 the ball we are going to occupy a base can 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.850
 be any kind of ball or some 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.820
 stone 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.010
 our rag and cinnamon ribbon for 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.800
 start the ball 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.000
 let's go grabbing our rag 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.080
 we will go wrapping up to cover 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.080
 the whole ball 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.430
 and so we're going to go with all the rag and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.770
 when we have it more advanced 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.129
 leaving our ball so we 're going to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.129
 follow 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.950
 joining 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.230
 rag until more or less we close 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.820
 our hand like that when we finish the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.040
 thickness of our ball we can with 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.079
 cinnamon ribbon 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.300
 we are going to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.450
 to cover all the spaces until 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.180
 It is completely full our 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.920
 our ball since we have already made 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.920
 our ball we are going to grab 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.480
 our tie 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.170
 to start we are going to 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.940
 to leave a guide 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.720
 let's grab a flat part of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.540
 our ball 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.860
 with our big toe we are going to hold 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 we are going to leave a small guide 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.070
 let's move on 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.150
 we tighten well we went down 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.150
 we treat each other well 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.800
 let's go down 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.800
 we treat each other well 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.520
 go down already when we have 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.260
 our 8 segments we are going to press very 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.540
 well the ball 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.540
 our guide with our area needle 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.930
 we're going to brown it 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.180
 since it is well stuck we will see that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.780
 our our asterisk is very 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.780
 well done 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.849
 since it is well done 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.200
 and let's tighten the last part well 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.660
 of the tie 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.860
 let's move on to any segment 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.050
 with the needle area we will pull let 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.569
 to make a u we're going to go down 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.710
 of our ball 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.590
 and we tighten well 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.760
 so we went to the next one under 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.110
 we went down 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.110
 we make a u again 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.720
 and let's learn like that let's continue with 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.240
 our ball 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.440
 here we have a good ball here we go 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.350
 starting 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.850
 it is becoming a fabric and we continue 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.530
 same 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.530
 again down 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.220
 we press very well we go to the next 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.660
 down 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.660
 we do not have the area needle 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.959
 again a 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.250
 here we go more or less in a start here 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.500
 let's go to the middle 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.950
 when we are going to finish our ball 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.630
 follows the same fabric is giving us a 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.090
 net 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.650
 here we are going for the last round here 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.580
 what I am going to teach you is how 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.470
 hide our last piece 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.090
 we continue doing the same process 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.090
 we put with our needle the area 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.099
 we speak very well 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.099
 usually below the ball 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.190
 again we do the same process here 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.790
 as we already have our short tie 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.700
 if you want anything else we squeeze well 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.060
 we leave the gap and we pass it by now 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.049
 pass the ball down 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.049
 we go back to 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.190
 when going to the next 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.380
 we go back to swim 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.270
 down below 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.270
 we finished our ball 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:49.169
 again we passed 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.169
 since we have finished we are going to cut 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.449
 our relationship is cool 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.809
 and now this piece that is left we're going to 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.809
 to lose 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.900
 we tighten it well to make it more something 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.900
 a little easier 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.720
 let's go out 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.130
 why 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.130
 they put it back in another 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.280
 also good and here we already have our 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.280
 ball ends
