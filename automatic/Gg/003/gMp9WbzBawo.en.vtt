00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.809 
you don't have that kind of time you
could<00:02:31.590> probably<00:02:31.769> pop<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.430> into<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
could probably pop this into the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.660 
could probably pop this into the
microwave<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.600> whole<00:02:33.840> shebang<00:02:34.670> really

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
microwave the whole shebang really

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
microwave the whole shebang really
quickly<00:02:35.970> maybe<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> minute<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.049> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
quickly maybe for like a minute and it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.199 
quickly maybe for like a minute and it
would<00:02:37.290> ball<00:02:37.500> itself<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> really

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
would ball itself but it is a really

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.970 
would ball itself but it is a really
really<00:02:39.510> delicious<00:02:39.780> breakfast<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:40.769> nice

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
really delicious breakfast and it's nice

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.670 
really delicious breakfast and it's nice
and<00:02:41.190> cold<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> summer<00:02:41.910> day<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:46.080> last<00:02:46.380> meal

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and cold on a summer day this last meal

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.949 
and cold on a summer day this last meal
is<00:02:46.709> probably<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.700> fastest<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.420> maybe<00:02:48.720> even

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
is probably the fastest and maybe even

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.270 
is probably the fastest and maybe even
the<00:02:49.140> most<00:02:49.290> filling<00:02:49.709> because<00:02:49.860> there's<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.220> lot

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the most filling because there's a lot

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.400 
the most filling because there's a lot
of<00:02:50.519> protein<00:02:51.090> you'll<00:02:51.540> want<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.959> get<00:02:52.110> whole
