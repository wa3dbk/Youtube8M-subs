jagged edges or pointed corners because

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
jagged edges or pointed corners because

when this shrinks down it gets thicker

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
when this shrinks down it gets thicker
as<00:01:40.860> well<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.060> means<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> sharp<00:01:42.780> edges

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
as well and that means that sharp edges

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
as well and that means that sharp edges
get<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.890> sharp<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.759> pointy<00:01:45.240> and

get really sharp and really pointy and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
get really sharp and really pointy and
they<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.720> hurt<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.229> they<00:01:46.439> stab<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.950> while

they will hurt if they stab you while
you're<00:01:47.340> wearing<00:01:47.549> them<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.450> you'll<00:01:48.600> probably

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you're wearing them so you'll probably

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
you're wearing them so you'll probably
