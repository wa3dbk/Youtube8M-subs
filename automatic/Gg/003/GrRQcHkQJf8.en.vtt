00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.700
 after more than a year of rumors 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 finally the first clock 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.560
 smart apple has hit the market 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.109
 in just one month of sales in the states 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.140

 otis EPO units than all 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.240
 martin whyte added in 2014 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 will it be worth investing in your 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.510
 money on apple's newest bet 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.730
 find out now in this analysis edward is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.650
 compatible only with the iphone more 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.740
 precisely the models released to 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.260
 from the iphone 5 there are three lines 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:54.030
 the sport line has ten 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.290
 models priced between 349 and 399 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.380
 dollars 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:03.990
 the apple to ti line has 20 variations with 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:06.380
 between $ 549 and $ 1099 and the 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.689
 editing features eight luxurious models 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.030
 which cost between 10 thousand and 17 thousand dollars 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:18.179
 there are two variations in the size of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.149
 watch the 38 mm model with 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:24.210
 34-inch comma screen and one 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.810
 model of 42 mm with a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.999
 comma 54 inches 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.429
 the cases can be aluminum steel 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.390
 stainless or gold-plated 18 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.670
 carats 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.999
 bracelets are also available in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.679
 various materials such as rubber curu the 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:45.749
 metal with rectangular display the apple has opted 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.869
 for maintaining a standard that refers to the 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.409
 look of the iphone 6 on the right side of the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.020
 case 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.090
 there are two physical buttons one of them works 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.499
 as a direct shortcut to your 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.439
 favorite contacts 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:01.540
 and the other is the so-called crown to control 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.890
 specific software functions 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.010
 extremely light the model stands out 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.649
 by its design is undeniably one of the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.840
 Most beautiful watches on the market 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.030
 bracelets are removable and in the future 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.500
 will be possible to buy other 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.540
 variations directly at the apple store 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.730
 the idea is that the eco office make each 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.400
 design accessory on your computer. 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.780
 it is worth remembering that the watch 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.300
 waterproof 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.850
 the rectangular display may not be the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.230
 usual in watches but it works a lot 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.000
 well for the optimal apple proposal 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.510
 model we tested is one with larger screen 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.459
 of a 54-inch comma and its 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.760
 touch sensitivity is shown 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.950
 enough precise fabric is more 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.709
 than enough to display all the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.989
 functions of the device you can control 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.300
 the brightness and functions 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.800
 automatic activation of the screen from the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.050
 wrist movement 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.300
 even in the sunlight it is possible 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.380
 check notifications on the screen with 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.870
 tranquility 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.900
 in terms of performance, at least in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.760
 our tests the EPCOT did very well 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.590
 but it's worth remembering that it works a lot 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.680
 more as a mirror of what is 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.360
 installed on your phone as a shortcut to 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.580
 the most diverse functions 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.860
 it works fine without delays in the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.049
 response time to commands and with a 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.450
 called a force touch feature that allows 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.370
 recognize the intensity of the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.420
 screen is the operating system of the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.580
 great apple 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.549
 it is quite similar to the west of 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.209
 iphones and press for a rather 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.730
 intuitive 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.580
 the main addition to the world of pouches 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.799
 is the crown-shaped side knob 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.200
 smart zoom solution 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.370
 zoom out on the interface or even 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.890
 how to scroll some - sliding the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.380
 Fingers up, you can check the hits. 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.230
 system you have access to the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.510
 notifications by pressing the crown button 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.120
 the user is directed to the interface 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.209
 principal order in which they are listed 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.370
 all installed applications 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.950
 the solutions found by the company are 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.019
 and usability is one of the 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.609
 device strengths 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.130
 According to Apple's battery life 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.710
 device can reach 18 hours 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.630
 in our moderate use tests 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.760
 we have come to exceed this time in 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.510
 several occasions keeping only 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.940
 notifications, but if you choose 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.370
 for using the applications via 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.080
 ismael tiote the battery life drops from 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.510
 significantly 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.050
 just over 12 hours are sufficient for 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.100
 charge is completely exhausted 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.230
 comparing the apple model with 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.300
 watches from other manufacturers 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.940
 results are very similar 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.060
 epcot is no stranger on the bizarre 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.460
 but also does not disappoint but one thing 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.169
 You're sure to have to carry the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.820
 every day 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.070
 The good news is that the time for 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.070
 full recharge does not exceed one hour 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.759
 still unavailable in the Brazilian market 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.949
 ecowas is already the main product of 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.990
 category in number of sales 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.999
 this does not mean that it is a 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.249
 ideal smart watch 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.709
 in fact all mark waters 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.229
 available on the market are still very 

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:28.129
 dependent on cell phones, which makes them 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.749
 a kind of smartphone mirror 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.789
 allows functions such as sending and receiving 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:35.639
 receiving notifications in several 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.139
 apps, text messages and links 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.330
 to serve as a personal assistant 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.879
 to measure data such as distance 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.879
 burned calories burned 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.340
 integration with Syria is another 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:51.010
 positive that deserves attention 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.290
 these simpler models or even 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.780
 in some of the intermediate versions 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.669
 Epcot is undoubtedly a good choice for 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.520
 purchase for those who use a 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.430
 iphone but at least for now 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.889
 pay more than $ 600 on a smart 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.530
 office does not seem to be a good idea 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.650
 that its use does not yet justify the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.650
 investment 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.130
 it is worth remembering that in the second 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.230
 apple great many of your problems 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.870
 must be resolved 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.330
 apple has already confirmed that apple ipad 2 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.070
 will be more independent and will have the 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.290
 more open 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.420
