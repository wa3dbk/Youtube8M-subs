00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.146
 No Wii pony, no paper windmill, no explosion 

00:00:03.146 --> 00:00:05.011
 Ah~ I am so bored. 

00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:06.158
 Shut up 

00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:07.676
 Some of us just like to stay in the kitchen like this. 

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:10.551
 Wow, there is a large green onion, it is called "green onion" (he puts the words green and onion together, but this is the name of a fish) 

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:13.089
 Green onions? What? Do you mean this guy? (This is onion onion) 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.692
 Oh no! He is back! He is back! 

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:18.971
 He returned to the kitchen! No!! 

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:24.641
 Hey! Large green onions! Hey! Big ~ green onions 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.322
 I am not a big green onion! I am a leek!! (leak) 

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.870
 Really? I don't know if it's raining yet (leak 韭 ​​音 sound with leak leaking, pun) 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.920
 You know that I don't mean this! 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.875
 Hey! You will be annoying (drip) (drip has an annoying meaning with water droplets, pun) 

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:37.949
 It’s a pity, if you have a few more, it’s fine. 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.074
 This way you can have a small puddle (Liu Ding insists that he is leaking water, so he will become a puddle) 

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.855
 Sorry, is this funny? 

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:45.582
 What's wrong? Someone kicked the bucket of rainwater? (kick the bucket literally kicks the bucket, but there is death) 

00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:50.314
 I am a leek, ok? Leek is... um... 

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:51.484
 Big green onions? 

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.816
 Ok, forget it, even if it’s a big green onion, please close it now... 

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:56.131
 Hey! Listen to my rap! 

00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.968
 Hey! Leek! What's going on with your head? 

00:00:57.968 --> 00:00:59.514
 Your stem is like a frightening white 

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.853
 It has always been like this! It is the stem! 

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:06.409
 Don't talk to him! This will only make things worse!! 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.010
 Hey! Weird leeks! Hey! Weird leeks! 嘿 (Freekey Zekey is an American rapper, Liu Ding is deliberately called homophonic) 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.173
 I can’t hear~ I’m not listening~ 

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.227
 That's it? Have you heard it now? 

00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:17.076
 Nothing like that? 

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.105
 Can you hear this? Can't hear!! 

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.819
 Weeds! Weeds! Weeds! I am here!! 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.582
 I don't want to listen!!!!!!! 

00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:26.314
 No! Look here!! 

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:29.495
 It’s me who takes the loudspeaker!! It sounds like this!! 

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:34.610
 Stop! Who will help stop him!! 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.117
 Okay! I saw it, I heard it, we can hear you! 

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:41.817
 What do you want now? 喔.. 

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:43.379
 I forgot what I am going to do. 

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.043
 Do you remember? 

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:46.632
 Hey! Leek! Do you want to sip (gleek)? (gleek is similar to leek) 

00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:48.391
 Ok, actually I don’t even know what you are saying. 

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.432
 What about the small leeks? (Onions are shorter than leeks, so Liu Ding calls him small leeks.) Will he spit? 

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:51.911
 Don't pull me in 

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.082
 Leek spit! Leek spit! Leek spit... 

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:56.198
 Oh! I must leave this kitchen. 

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.359
 Oh, well, then I have to start! Spit! 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.012
 Oh! This is really super evil. 

00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:04.825
 No, this is spit! Do you understand? (Not "super evil", it is "spit") 

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.344
 Stop! Stop now! 

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:09.733
 Come on, green onions! Let's have fun together (he combines fun and onion onion as funion) 

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.192
 It’s not fun at all! Stop! Stop! I’m true! 

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:18.258
 Sprayed into my eyes! Oh, sorry, everyone. 

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:20.980
 I must have set it to repeat the spit mode. 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.739
 Um.. I think it’s already like this, it shouldn’t be worse. 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.552
 No! Don't crow mouth.... Hey! 

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.608
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Weird! 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:28.938
 No! Don't come again. 

00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:32.663
 Don't spit! Don't swear through the pun! Don't be stupid rhymes! 

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.563
 Can you do it? Please? 

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:37.673
 It should be OK, you can do it best! Have you heard it clearly? 

00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:40.425
 very good!!! 

00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:43.168
 Um....I have something important to say. 

00:02:43.168 --> 00:02:45.689
 Ok! What do you want to say now? 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.752
 Knife! What are you talking about? 

00:02:52.052 --> 00:02:54.962
 Wow! Poor guy! 

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:58.162
 He has to shorten his scallion (the end of the leek end onion and the weekend end homonym) 

00:02:58.162 --> 00:03:01.364
 It’s terrible, don’t worry, little leek 

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.132
 I know how to help you cheer up? 

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:05.945
 Of course! What you need now is.... saliva! 

00:03:08.424 --> 00:03:11.539
 I really should pay some other friends. 

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:14.776
 Hey! Why are you still using that haunted TV? 

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:17.710
 He just said.... Haunted? 

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:27.048
 Not fair! We are all on TV! 

00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:29.556
 Knife! (polujony subtitle production)
