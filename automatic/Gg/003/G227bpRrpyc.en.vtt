00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.499
 Yeah I think 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.439
 It is finally 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.050
 Then I mean that so much in-house development 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.650
 From the customer 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 Kim: I'm not actively working, but I have a lot of work at work 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.650
 According to the team power 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.269
 Morinaga Seika 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.800
 I have been flying from Helsinki since October but coming in at number 9 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.900
 Though 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.350
 It is meaning with a little expectation recently 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.410
 Momoko Ueda, who started in Kanazawa, is going to make a mistake 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.370
 It was out, but this time 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 This name 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.499
 This time is 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.370
 It feels like it is included 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.400
 It looks like ghee 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.590
 Then you 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 That judge person complains of headache 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.540
 Canceled on a flight so much that it was a failure 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.719
 38-42 yen 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:02.720
 There is no design power 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.400
 I do not understand the story well 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.310
 The cheap feeling is dominant and it's about 920,000 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.890
 It seems like people are coming out and it's booming 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.790
 It was that kind of feeling but 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
 I'm calling glamorous from around 80 pages 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.040
 The book- 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.760
 It is 15 o'clock when it seems that it was amazing in the middle of a while in teleport saying 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.370
 The old story of Mr. suddenly begins 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.880
 Even those who have no time to start talking are shown 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 To take 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.259
 First of all, the girl from December joined 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.280
 Yes that one year late 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010
 I talked about old tale and mythology 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.660
 There is rice mess 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.050
 Called Shira Nita appointed by the grandfather from the audition 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.700
 No, this is certainly interesting according to reputation 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910
 I thought like 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.910
 Let's do especially that white thing 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.950
 I have miserable eyes praying for new health, but with the button on the 7th 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.370
 I'm not a good girl for my god 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.740
 It's a very good practice, but I'm pretty much up front 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.460
 The city's first boyhood great survival 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.160
 Organize 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.680
 I'm going early 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.680
 It is such a high because I have already had a hard time 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.199
 What is the reason from the source code of the store is what the age is saying 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.359
 After all people 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.269
 When it's small 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.569
 Peace 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.379
 Sino-Japanese War Fight 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.049
 As a soldier

 Being recruited 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.749

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.909

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.879
 I have a hard time living in the school and I have a talk 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.799
 Though 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.089
 Well, I would like to expect such an objection 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.279
 Yeah 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.279
 Very rival from 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.729
 I was in bullying 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.619
 It is British Central Bank but I will survive there 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.639
 The story is very responsible 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.249
 Ishikawa's 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:52.699
 First of all thanks 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.209
 I'm very very sorry 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.819
 Because it is perspective 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.989
 Nuclear plan to attend magic school 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.219
 It is the beauty to talk to Misora ​​Hibarikan 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.409
 I want to make the most of it 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.339
 Join eca 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.309
 Food feature 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.069
 Ando, ​​now with biosensors 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.999
 In this case why live alone in Chrysler 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.540
 College students who must do it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.469
 I can really study 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.599
 Yes there is no banned personnel aspect and it will not do anything 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.909
 I think that I will stop for the previous role search 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.819
 That is not all 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.989
 Picasso's meat was separated and I was more than me 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:29.870
 Like 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.679
 And I confirmed 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.419
 Many friends too 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.309
 Last month love 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.789
 How to deal with general strikes 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.619
 It is not as a sound 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.949
 Is it a type that can be empathic and read 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.479
 I think it's a story 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.399
 In the world of those everyday life 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.399
 A very large background to the coming story 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.299
 Everyone is like that 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.189
 Also about the formation of the society of the country of March 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.709
 At this time, or after this 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.469
 In terms of the emachines killer chronicle 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.819
 I've been waiting for you, but I'm going to kill Mr. Makishima 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.380
 Well expected and this work too 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.400
 It is said that it will be a thing at all 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.050
 While discussing what will happen in the future 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.429
 If a popular youth story is written, it will be a good current story 

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:27.830
 Come in the tracker language also overseas 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.340
 It is the second day the third day after this 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.240
 I would like to put on the way to go down, which will be added 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.370
 I think 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.110
 I think that's a story like that 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.590
 At least 80 pages of server spycumen available 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.150
 Until 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.120
 Yeah 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.809
 Read while doing my work 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.710
 The outing is that 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.479
 House 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.370
 This is the first time 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.479
 Start with people 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.669
 Ugly and sad 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.099
 I wish I could read it while I was thrilled with school 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.789
 It is said that 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.289
 Anyway, in the wording of the party exec 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.919
 Toyama already has more fans 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.199
 Yeah yes indeed 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.259
 I'm sorry that I can not keep up 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.449
 And again I think this time 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.469
 You may have argued a little more but 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.559
 It is a make-drama, but specified as the solution 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:14.690
 While I want to keep it 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.879
 However, even those who are considered to be preferred stocks today 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.110
 Mano There is a long time ago that I read the previous period green label 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.240
 Search for about 20 years by yourself 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.319
 People like 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.430
 Well such a person is surely that before this is that 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.490
 I recommend it because I think it looks interesting
