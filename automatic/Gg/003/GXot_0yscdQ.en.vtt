00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
I was very skeptical I really didn't

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.470 
I was very skeptical I really didn't
think<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:14.099> will<00:00:14.219> work<00:00:14.280> whatsoever<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
think it will work whatsoever and I

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.269 
think it will work whatsoever and I
thought<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.870> more<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.830> fun<00:00:17.130> or

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
thought it was more of just a for fun or

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.189 
thought it was more of just a for fun or
maybe<00:00:17.430> troll<00:00:17.850> build<00:00:18.150> rather<00:00:18.480> than<00:00:18.690> actually

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
maybe troll build rather than actually

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540 
maybe troll build rather than actually
being<00:00:19.230> something<00:00:19.650> serious<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.430> potentially

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
being something serious and potentially

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.790 
being something serious and potentially
good<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.480> did<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.810> me<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.990> while<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> finally

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
good it did take me a while to finally

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.590 
good it did take me a while to finally
get<00:00:22.949> convinced<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.670> barely<00:00:23.910> played<00:00:24.330> myself

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
get convinced I barely played myself

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.390

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
damage with a hint of AD so it's a very

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
damage with a hint of AD so it's a very
quick<00:01:23.790> summary<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.299> beauty<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.990> teef<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
quick summary the beauty of a teef is is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
quick summary the beauty of a teef is is
you<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.580> hit<00:01:26.930> affecting<00:01:27.930> our

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you have a lot of on hit affecting our

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.230 
you have a lot of on hit affecting our
your<00:01:28.259> w<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.979> shin<00:01:29.280> effect<00:01:29.549> from<00:01:29.670> Triforce

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
your w your shin effect from Triforce

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760 
your w your shin effect from Triforce
your<00:01:30.450> blade<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> ruined<00:01:30.930> King<00:01:31.259> maybe<00:01:31.560> even

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
your blade of the ruined King maybe even

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
your blade of the ruined King maybe even
a<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.189> send<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> fact<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.119> getting

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
a would send and the fact that getting

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 
a would send and the fact that getting
the<00:01:33.509> forty<00:01:33.840> percent<00:01:34.140> cooldown<00:01:34.530> reduction<00:01:34.650> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the forty percent cooldown reduction is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
the forty percent cooldown reduction is
quite<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> necessity<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> final<00:01:36.689> thing<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
quite a necessity and the final thing is

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
quite a necessity and the final thing is
you<00:01:37.259> will<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.590> building<00:01:37.890> tank<00:01:38.189> items<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.729> not

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
you will be building tank items so not

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.190 
you will be building tank items so not
only<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> annoying<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> deal<00:01:39.900> with

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
only are you annoying to deal with

because you're so slippery with the

forty percent of CDR you're actually

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
forty percent of CDR you're actually
very<00:01:43.290> tanky<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.369> damage<00:01:44.670> output<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
very tanky and your damage output is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.700 
very tanky and your damage output is
still<00:01:45.329> nothing<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.780> laugh<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.110> before<00:01:46.619> we

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
still nothing to laugh at before we

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.260 
still nothing to laugh at before we
actually<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.159> into<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> positives<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
actually go into the positives of a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
actually go into the positives of a
thief<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.810> want<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> quickly<00:01:49.200> mention<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
thief is I want to quickly mention that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.130 
thief is I want to quickly mention that
you<00:01:49.829> want<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> max<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.700> W<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.479> followed<00:01:52.110> by

you want to max your W first followed by

you want to max your W first followed by
you<00:01:52.290> eat<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.220> finally<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.909> Q<00:01:54.180> ability

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you eat and then finally your Q ability

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.569 
you eat and then finally your Q ability
the<00:01:54.930> reason<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.829> W<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> your

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the reason is because your W is your

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
the reason is because your W is your
main<00:01:56.759> source<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.149> damage<00:01:57.570> while<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.960> just

main source of damage while you're just

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410 
main source of damage while you're just
so<00:01:58.890> important<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.549> terms<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.880> having<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.270> lower

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so important in terms of having a lower

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.780 
so important in terms of having a lower
cool

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
cool

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.910 
cool
you<00:02:01.150> really<00:02:01.390> need<00:02:01.510> to<00:02:01.570> max<00:02:01.900> it<00:02:02.110> second<00:02:02.560> so

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
you really need to max it second so

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.440 
you really need to max it second so
let's<00:02:03.100> quickly<00:02:03.280> go<00:02:03.580> through<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.910> positives

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
let's quickly go through the positives

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.420 
let's quickly go through the positives
of<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.140> thief<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.830> first<00:02:06.160> thing<00:02:06.280> like

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
i said is that it probably is more

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.020 
i said is that it probably is more
annoying<00:02:08.440> than<00:02:08.710> a<00:02:08.890> thief<00:02:09.100> is<00:02:09.369> because<00:02:09.729> again

consistent damage coming out and you're

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.130 
consistent damage coming out and you're
just<00:02:15.250> very<00:02:15.700> annoying<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.300> deal<00:02:16.330> with<00:02:16.660> now<00:02:16.960> this

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
just very annoying to deal with now this

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.410 
just very annoying to deal with now this
next<00:02:17.380> positive<00:02:17.650> isn't<00:02:18.190> really<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> positive<00:02:19.300> is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
next positive isn't really a positive is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.120 
next positive isn't really a positive is
just<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.750> different<00:02:20.140> type<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.320> play<00:02:20.650> style<00:02:20.980> for

just a different type of play style for

immense<00:02:23.530> burst<00:02:23.920> while<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.610> teef<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:25.060> doesn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
immense burst while a teef is doesn't

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.940 
immense burst while a teef is doesn't
really<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:25.900> same<00:02:26.320> burst<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
really have that same burst but the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.490 
really have that same burst but the
damage<00:02:27.340> output<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.940> very<00:02:28.390> very<00:02:28.690> consistent

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
damage output is very very consistent

damage output is very very consistent
which<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:29.980> why<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.190> see<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> teef<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
which is why you see a teef is in the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.120 
which is why you see a teef is in the
top<00:02:31.510> lane<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.900> maybe<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.230> jungle<00:02:32.620> more<00:02:32.890> often

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
top lane and maybe the jungle more often

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.650 
top lane and maybe the jungle more often
than<00:02:33.280> you'll<00:02:33.430> see<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:33.790> mint<00:02:34.090> because<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.510> just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
than you'll see if mint because it just

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.690 
than you'll see if mint because it just

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
positive now the next point is probably

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.540 
positive now the next point is probably
the<00:02:43.300> main<00:02:43.630> reason<00:02:43.660> as<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.230> why<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.770> teef<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.130> even

why I always look down upon a teef is

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.160 
why I always look down upon a teef is
it's<00:03:42.040> because<00:03:42.340> he<00:03:42.489> doesn't<00:03:42.730> provide<00:03:43.269> any<00:03:43.450> CC

again<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.019> want<00:04:04.260> those<00:04:04.499> lanes<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.920> bring<00:04:05.129> CC

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
again you want those lanes to bring CC

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.369 
again you want those lanes to bring CC
so<00:04:05.969> my<00:04:06.120> opinion<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:06.599> is<00:04:06.659> probably<00:04:07.049> one<00:04:07.349> of

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
so my opinion this is probably one of

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.410 
so my opinion this is probably one of
the<00:04:07.499> biggest<00:04:07.769> drawbacks<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.700> because<00:04:08.999> of<00:04:09.030> that

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
the biggest drawbacks it because of that

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.539 
the biggest drawbacks it because of that
my<00:04:09.659> second<00:04:10.019> point<00:04:10.170> if<00:04:10.439> he<00:04:10.560> falls<00:04:10.829> behind<00:04:10.950> he's

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
my second point if he falls behind he's

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.039 
my second point if he falls behind he's
very<00:04:11.819> useless<00:04:12.090> because<00:04:12.359> usually<00:04:12.629> if<00:04:12.930> you're

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
very useless because usually if you're

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.989 
very useless because usually if you're
playing<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.439> vibe<00:04:13.680> jungle<00:04:14.159> or<00:04:14.280> am<00:04:14.370> alki<00:04:14.730> top

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:14.999 
playing a vibe jungle or am alki top

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.550 
playing a vibe jungle or am alki top
even<00:04:15.420> if<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.599> fall<00:04:15.810> behind<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.320> mean<00:04:16.440> you're

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
even if you fall behind I mean you're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.930 
even if you fall behind I mean you're
still<00:04:16.799> pretty<00:04:17.009> useful<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.519> still<00:04:17.729> bring<00:04:17.910> the

still pretty useful you still bring the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.879 
still pretty useful you still bring the

Malachi snare Malachi's ultimate

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.060 
Malachi snare Malachi's ultimate
reducing<00:04:22.049> damage<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.530> overall<00:04:22.889> they're

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
reducing damage and overall they're

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.860 
reducing damage and overall they're
still<00:04:23.400> very<00:04:23.699> useful<00:04:24.210> thanks<00:04:24.509> to<00:04:24.750> their

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
not gonna really bring a whole lot at

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.499 
not gonna really bring a whole lot at
the<00:04:31.919> team<00:04:32.190> especially<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:33.000> your<00:04:33.120> mid<00:04:33.300> laner

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
the team especially if your mid laner

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.600 
the team especially if your mid laner
doesn't<00:04:33.900> already<00:04:34.050> bring<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.650> lot<00:04:34.800> of<00:04:34.919> CC<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.580> a

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
doesn't already bring a lot of CC so a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.550 
doesn't already bring a lot of CC so a
very<00:04:35.910> risky<00:04:36.419> pick<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.840> mean<00:04:36.990> if<00:04:37.110> he<00:04:37.199> gets<00:04:37.380> ahead

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
very risky pick I mean if he gets ahead

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.260 
very risky pick I mean if he gets ahead
yeah<00:04:38.039> he's<00:04:38.250> very<00:04:38.340> strong<00:04:38.849> and<00:04:39.090> he<00:04:39.150> can

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
yeah he's very strong and he can

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.909 
yeah he's very strong and he can
probably<00:04:39.479> solo<00:04:39.960> carry<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:40.590> if<00:04:40.680> he<00:04:40.770> gets

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
probably solo carry but if he gets

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.860 
probably solo carry but if he gets
behind<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.699> mean<00:04:41.849> good<00:04:42.030> luck<00:04:42.180> winning<00:04:42.419> another

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
behind I mean good luck winning another

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.510 
behind I mean good luck winning another
thing<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.320> fact<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.680> his<00:04:43.860> Q<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> only

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
thing is the fact that his Q is the only

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.879 
thing is the fact that his Q is the only
ability<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.360> does<00:04:45.599> have<00:04:45.810> 80<00:04:46.050> ratios<00:04:46.620> but

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
ability that does have 80 ratios but

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.560 
ability that does have 80 ratios but
again<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.340> does<00:04:47.550> make<00:04:47.759> up<00:04:47.910> for<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> fact<00:04:48.180> that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
again it does make up for the fact that

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.240 
again it does make up for the fact that
his<00:04:48.840> ultimate<00:04:49.259> gives<00:04:49.410> him<00:04:49.560> twenty<00:04:49.949> percent

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
his ultimate gives him twenty percent

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.189 
his ultimate gives him twenty percent
damage<00:04:50.460> increase<00:04:51.000> which<00:04:51.360> really<00:04:51.599> is<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.020> only

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
damage increase which really is the only

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.650 
damage increase which really is the only
reason<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.830> teef<00:04:53.009> is<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.520> even<00:04:53.820> viable<00:04:54.090> in<00:04:54.479> the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
reason a teef is is even viable in the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.600 
reason a teef is is even viable in the
final<00:04:54.990> thing<00:04:55.139> he<00:04:55.380> has<00:04:55.560> no<00:04:55.770> burst<00:04:56.039> damage<00:04:56.250> it's

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
final thing he has no burst damage it's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.790 
final thing he has no burst damage it's
very<00:04:56.849> consistent<00:04:57.750> which<00:04:57.990> again<00:04:58.320> for<00:04:58.590> top

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
very consistent which again for top

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.740 
very consistent which again for top
laners<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.310> jungles<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.849> fine<00:05:00.150> with<00:05:00.509> the<00:05:00.570> play

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
laners and jungles is fine with the play

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.120 
laners and jungles is fine with the play
style<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.199> just<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.530> little<00:05:01.680> different

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
style is just a little different

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.159 
style is just a little different
compressive<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.699> pieces<00:05:03.120> alright<00:05:03.720> guys<00:05:03.900> let's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
compressive a pieces alright guys let's

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.900 
compressive a pieces alright guys let's
go<00:05:04.320> into<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.620> juiciest<00:05:05.160> part<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.610> video

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
go into the juiciest part of the video

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.850 
go into the juiciest part of the video
the<00:05:06.300> items<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.110> can<00:05:07.289> start<00:05:07.530> off<00:05:07.680> with

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
the items so you can start off with

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.680 
the items so you can start off with
either<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.159> flask<00:05:08.520> adorns<00:05:09.240> or<00:05:09.360> even<00:05:09.599> a

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
either a flask adorns or even a

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.899 
either a flask adorns or even a
longsword<00:05:10.259> just<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.889> be<00:05:11.009> safe<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.340> recommend<00:05:11.820> a

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
longsword just to be safe I recommend a

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.279 
longsword just to be safe I recommend a
flask<00:05:12.180> but<00:05:12.449> if<00:05:12.570> you<00:05:12.630> feel<00:05:12.810> like<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:13.020> can<00:05:13.169> be

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
flask but if you feel like you can be

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.899 
flask but if you feel like you can be
super<00:05:13.650> aggressive<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.370> laning<00:05:14.610> phase

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
super aggressive in the laning phase

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.520 
super aggressive in the laning phase
you're<00:05:15.120> not<00:05:15.240> really<00:05:15.449> scared<00:05:15.599> of<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.169> opponent

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
you're not really scared of the opponent

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.320 
you're not really scared of the opponent
then<00:05:16.919> go<00:05:17.070> for<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.280> door<00:05:17.520> ends<00:05:17.669> or<00:05:17.820> long<00:05:18.030> story

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
then go for the door ends or long story

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.089 
then go for the door ends or long story
now<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.570> very<00:05:18.840> first<00:05:19.139> item<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.560> want<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.770> rush

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
now the very first item you want to rush

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.219 
now the very first item you want to rush
almost<00:05:20.550> without<00:05:20.729> any<00:05:21.060> exceptions<00:05:21.720> is<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
almost without any exceptions is the

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.230 
almost without any exceptions is the
Triforce<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:23.009> you<00:05:23.159> can<00:05:23.340> get<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.580> sheen<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.030> one

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
Triforce if you can get the sheen in one

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.060 
Triforce if you can get the sheen in one
by<00:05:24.509> I<00:05:24.539> recommend<00:05:25.139> picking<00:05:25.259> that<00:05:25.500> up<00:05:25.560> if<00:05:25.860> you

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070

Triforce is your most essential items so
make<00:05:32.250> sure<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.520> get<00:05:32.699> that<00:05:32.849> first<00:05:33.150> before

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389

start<00:05:35.520> getting<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:35.909> CDR<00:05:36.360> because<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.900> teef<00:05:37.080> is

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
start getting the CDR because a teef is

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.040 
start getting the CDR because a teef is
is<00:05:37.500> just<00:05:37.770> super<00:05:38.190> reliant<00:05:38.669> on<00:05:38.759> CDR<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.630> boots<00:05:39.900> of
