kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.059> common<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
kind of have one thing in common and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.090 
kind of have one thing in common and
that<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.789> mobile<00:00:53.789> quarterback<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.100> that's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that was a mobile quarterback so that's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
that was a mobile quarterback so that's
pretty<00:00:56.370> important<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.329> guess<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
pretty important and I guess the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
pretty important and I guess the
question<00:00:57.899> remains<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.739> why<00:00:59.309> why<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
question remains is why why is that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.090 
question remains is why why is that
important<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.620> take<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> look<00:01:01.920> at

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
important well if you take a look at

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
important well if you take a look at
just<00:01:02.430> something<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.850> simple<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.719> defense

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
just something so simple as the defense

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.000 
just something so simple as the defense
here<00:01:04.320> something<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.159> run<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
here something that we run a lot into is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.500 
here something that we run a lot into is
max<00:01:08.010> coverage<00:01:08.250> defense<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> could

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
max coverage defense and what that could

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
max coverage defense and what that could
be<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.960> basically<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.250> dropping<00:01:11.640> every

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
be is basically it's dropping every

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
be is basically it's dropping every
defender<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:13.409> past<00:01:13.950> coverage<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:15.570> defend

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
defender into past coverage to defend

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.520 
defender into past coverage to defend
against<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> pass<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.280> only<00:01:17.820> rush<00:01:18.030> one

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
against the pass and only rush one

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
against the pass and only rush one
defender<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> something<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.000> we

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
defender so this is something that we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
defender so this is something that we
all<00:01:21.360> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> run<00:01:21.900> run<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.250> some<00:01:23.280> point

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
all kind of run run into at some point

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
all kind of run run into at some point
or<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> other<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:25.049> frustrating

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
or the other and it's pretty frustrating

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
or the other and it's pretty frustrating
especially<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.220> you'll<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> ball

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
especially if you'll have a ball

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
especially if you'll have a ball

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
see here I have a ton of outs I have all

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
see here I have a ton of outs I have all
my<00:01:52.470> concepts<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> can't<00:01:53.880> find<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
my concepts going but I can't find the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
my concepts going but I can't find the
guy<00:01:54.479> open<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.470> forced<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
guy open and then I'm forced out of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.649 
guy open and then I'm forced out of the
pocket<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.270> offensive<00:01:57.630> line

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
pocket a little bit in my offensive line

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
pocket a little bit in my offensive line
they<00:01:58.170> don't<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> good<00:01:58.680> job<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.520> get

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
they don't do a good job and I get

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.539 
they don't do a good job and I get
sacked<00:02:00.180> well<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:01.590> you're<00:02:02.070> using<00:02:02.369> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
sacked well if you're using a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
sacked well if you're using a
quarterback<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.180> isn't<00:02:03.600> mobile<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.890> have

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
quarterback that isn't mobile you have

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
quarterback that isn't mobile you have
to<00:02:05.280> bite<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.090> bullet<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> take

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to bite the bullet and you have to take

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.469 
to bite the bullet and you have to take
the<00:02:07.140> sack<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.129> problem<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> defense

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the sack now the problem for the defense

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.290 
the sack now the problem for the defense
becomes<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> mobile<00:02:10.500> quarterback

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
becomes if you have a mobile quarterback

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.190 
becomes if you have a mobile quarterback
like<00:02:12.300> error

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
like error

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.730 
like error
Rogers<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:14.730> example<00:02:15.209> now<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.530> make<00:02:16.680> your

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
Rogers for example now you can make your

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.860 
Rogers for example now you can make your
opponent<00:02:17.099> pay<00:02:17.489> because<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.420> they<00:02:18.569> drop

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
opponent pay because if they drop

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
opponent pay because if they drop
everyone<00:02:19.349> back<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
everyone back like so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.690 
everyone back like so
now<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.569> rush<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.989> guy<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.650> now<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.010> can

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
now they rush one guy and now you can

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
now they rush one guy and now you can
scramble<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.540> you're<00:02:25.170> picking<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.620> eight

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
scramble and you're picking up eight

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.180 
scramble and you're picking up eight
yard<00:02:26.250> chunks<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.940> time<00:02:27.140> now<00:02:28.140> you're<00:02:28.770> making

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
yard chunks at a time now you're making

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.580 
yard chunks at a time now you're making
them<00:02:29.370> pay<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.450> playing<00:02:30.720> max<00:02:30.959> coverage<00:02:31.200> even

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
them pay for playing max coverage even

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.830 
them pay for playing max coverage even
so<00:02:31.800> now<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> result<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.450> they<00:02:33.630> need<00:02:33.810> to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
so now the result of what they need to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.350 
so now the result of what they need to
worry<00:02:34.200> about<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.770> okay<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:35.940> they<00:02:36.150> need<00:02:36.300> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
worry about is okay now they need to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.259 
worry about is okay now they need to
start<00:02:36.569> quarterback<00:02:37.380> spine<00:02:37.950> at<00:02:38.400> least<00:02:38.730> one

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
start quarterback spine at least one

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.540 
start quarterback spine at least one
that<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:39.989> defender<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.190> spy<00:02:41.400> at

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
that one defender they have to spy at

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.430 
that one defender they have to spy at
least<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:42.060> because<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.019> they<00:02:43.200> know<00:02:43.230> they

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
least one because now they know they

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080 
least one because now they know they
have<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.739> worry<00:02:43.950> about<00:02:44.569> one<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.780> your<00:02:47.090> your

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
have to worry about one of your your

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.820 
have to worry about one of your your
your<00:02:48.150> quarterback<00:02:48.780> scrambling<00:02:49.260> ability<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
your quarterback scrambling ability and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.100 
your quarterback scrambling ability and
that<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.269> creates<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.720> dilemma<00:02:52.019> for

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that now that creates the dilemma for

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.970 
that now that creates the dilemma for
them<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.739> their<00:02:53.610> coverage<00:02:54.090> isn't<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.720> good<00:02:55.470> now

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
them is their coverage isn't as good now

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.350 
them is their coverage isn't as good now
there's<00:02:56.280> holes<00:02:56.549> in<00:02:56.790> their<00:02:56.910> coverage<00:02:57.209> as<00:02:57.299> you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
there's holes in their coverage as you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.330 
there's holes in their coverage as you
can<00:02:57.480> see<00:02:57.690> now<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.930> Cobb<00:02:58.500> brow<00:02:58.739> it's<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.100> open

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
can see now that Cobb brow it's now open

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.009 
can see now that Cobb brow it's now open
because<00:02:59.760> there's<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.420> hook<00:03:00.630> there<00:03:00.900> to

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
because there's not a hook there to

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.140 
because there's not a hook there to
defend<00:03:01.260> against<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.280> now<00:03:02.400> things<00:03:03.030> start

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
defend against it so now things start

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
defend against it so now things start
working<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> little<00:03:03.810> bit<00:03:04.019> better<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
working a little bit better for you and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.140 
working a little bit better for you and
now<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.769> coverage<00:03:05.190> defense<00:03:05.519> isn't<00:03:05.910> so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
now that coverage defense isn't so

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.890 
now that coverage defense isn't so
effective<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.650> once<00:03:07.830> was<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
effective as it once was so in in in the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.330 
effective as it once was so in in in the
beauty<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:11.010> can<00:03:11.160> even

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
beauty of this is that you can even

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.640 
beauty of this is that you can even
attack<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.060> spy<00:03:12.540> with<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> mobile

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
attack that spy with a mobile

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.110 
attack that spy with a mobile
quarterback<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.610> kind<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.850> roll<00:03:15.060> out

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
quarterback you just kind of roll out

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
quarterback you just kind of roll out
this<00:03:15.510> way<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.930> then<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.080> roll<00:03:16.440> back<00:03:16.470> out<00:03:16.980> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this way and then you roll back out and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.729 
this way and then you roll back out and
as<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.609> see<00:03:17.670> now<00:03:18.329> I've<00:03:18.570> passed<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.200> spy<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
as you can see now I've passed a spy and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.770 
as you can see now I've passed a spy and
I'm<00:03:19.799> picking<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.190> awesome<00:03:20.640> yards<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.120> that's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
I'm picking up awesome yards so that's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.599 
I'm picking up awesome yards so that's
what<00:03:21.959> number<00:03:22.170> 14<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.560> all<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.250> to

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
what number 14 is all about is is to

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.319 
what number 14 is all about is is to
have<00:03:24.350> an<00:03:25.350> organized<00:03:25.859> way<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.609> scramble<00:03:27.180> with

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
have an organized way to scramble with

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.509 
have an organized way to scramble with
the<00:03:27.480> quarterback<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:28.079> not<00:03:28.200> about

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
the quarterback it's not about

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.080 
the quarterback it's not about
scrambling<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.609> just<00:03:29.760> having<00:03:29.970> mass

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
scrambling and just having mass

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.460 
scrambling and just having mass
confusion<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.660> having<00:03:30.900> no<00:03:31.019> idea<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.350> you're
