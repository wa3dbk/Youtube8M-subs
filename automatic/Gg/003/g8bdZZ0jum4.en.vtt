elevators<00:00:07.099> so<00:00:08.099> there's<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.300> two<00:00:09.599> three<00:00:09.750> four

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
elevators so there's one two three four

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.379 
elevators so there's one two three four
five<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.090> six<00:00:13.219> so<00:00:14.219> let's<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.580> started<00:00:15.030> each

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
five and six so let's get started each

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.970 
five and six so let's get started each
of<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:16.020> improvements<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
of them have improvements on the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.560 
of them have improvements on the
previous<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.949> this<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.160> right<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
previous and this one right here was the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
previous and this one right here was the
design<00:00:21.960> by<00:00:22.640> JL<00:00:23.689> two<00:00:24.689> five<00:00:24.960> seven<00:00:25.170> nine<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.640> doc

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
design by JL two five seven nine and doc

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.189 
design by JL two five seven nine and doc
M<00:00:26.910> he<00:00:27.539> had<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> video<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.500> tutorial<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.099> I

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
M he had a video on it tutorial and I

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.700 
M he had a video on it tutorial and I
tried<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> copy<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> best<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.009> could

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
tried to copy the best I could

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.170 
tried to copy the best I could
so<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> map<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.000> Y<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.210> our

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
so right here we have a map the Y is our

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
so right here we have a map the Y is our
vertical<00:00:39.230> coordinates<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.890> down<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
vertical coordinates so if I go down it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.270 
vertical coordinates so if I go down it
decreases<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.050> increases<00:00:43.280> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
decreases if I go up it increases and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.500 
decreases if I go up it increases and
that's<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> determine<00:00:45.180> how

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that's how we're going to determine how

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.340 
that's how we're going to determine how
highly<00:00:45.870> skit<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> let's<00:00:47.910> fall<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.270> here

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.600 

we're<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.440> watch<00:00:52.620> her<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.949> why<00:00:53.219> we're<00:00:53.520> at

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
we're gonna watch her and why we're at

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
we're gonna watch her and why we're at
nine<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> twelve<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> their

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
nine and we go up to twelve so their

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
nine and we go up to twelve so their
design<00:00:58.800> did<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.039> work<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> Xbox<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.420> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
design did not work on the Xbox but I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.429 
design did not work on the Xbox but I
thought<00:01:01.500> since<00:01:01.730> t<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.210> easy<00:01:03.719> enough<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.320> if

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
thought since t is easy enough to get if

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
thought since t is easy enough to get if
you<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> efficient<00:01:05.489> mob<00:01:05.640> farm<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.750> lot

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you have a efficient mob farm and a lot

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.969 
you have a efficient mob farm and a lot
of<00:01:06.990> sand<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.580> would<00:01:08.880> work<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.979> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
of sand that I would work on these so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.219 
of sand that I would work on these so
over<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.549> mock<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
over here we have mock to this one I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.810 
over here we have mock to this one I
made<00:01:13.580> more<00:01:14.580> slim<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:16.340> try<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
made more slim and try to see if it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.200 
made more slim and try to see if it
worked

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
worked

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
worked
so<00:01:18.420> there's<00:01:19.380> TNT<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.670> bottom

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
so there's TNT all the way to the bottom

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
so there's TNT all the way to the bottom
over<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.490> let's<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.420> works<00:01:27.439> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
over here and let's see how it works so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.499 
over here and let's see how it works so
at<00:01:28.590> y<00:01:28.710> eleven<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> 14<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.360> even

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
at y eleven and we go to 14 so now even

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
at y eleven and we go to 14 so now even
out<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> chute<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:37.490> over<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.939> Mach<00:01:39.210> 3

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
out of the chute and over here at Mach 3

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.649 
out of the chute and over here at Mach 3
I<00:01:40.189> tried<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> change<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.880> their<00:01:42.150> design

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I tried to change up their design

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.510 
I tried to change up their design
bring<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> base<00:01:43.110> closer<00:01:43.530> maybe<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.310> have

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bring the base closer maybe that have

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.170 
bring the base closer maybe that have
more<00:01:44.700> effect<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.850> got<00:01:48.030> rid<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> any<00:01:48.540> water

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
more effect and I got rid of any water

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.639 
more effect and I got rid of any water
and<00:01:53.600> surprise<00:01:54.600> surprise<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.170> actually<00:01:55.470> can

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and surprise surprise you actually can

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.399 
and surprise surprise you actually can
live<00:01:55.829> without<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.280> water<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.700> Xbox<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> we're

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
live without the water on Xbox so we're

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
live without the water on Xbox so we're
at<00:01:58.469> Y<00:01:58.590> 11<00:01:59.960> let's<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.420> we

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
at Y 11 let's see what we get up to we

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.919 
at Y 11 let's see what we get up to we
go<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.990> Y<00:02:05.659> 94<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
go up to Y 94 and that is a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.470 
go up to Y 94 and that is a
seventy-three<00:02:10.800> block<00:02:11.069> increase

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
seventy-three block increase

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.559 
seventy-three block increase
into<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> sky<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> wasn't<00:02:15.000> happy<00:02:15.480> with

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
into the sky but I wasn't happy with

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.800 
into the sky but I wasn't happy with
that<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.870> get<00:02:16.110> higher<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.590> higher<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.810> made

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that one get higher and higher so I made

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:29.600 
that one get higher and higher so I made
a<00:02:18.840> 2<00:02:19.140> y<00:02:19.290> version<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.400> with

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
a 2 y version and you can do this with

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.449 
a 2 y version and you can do this with
someone<00:02:29.790> else's<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.160> have<00:02:32.280> two

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
someone else's so you can have two

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.729 
someone else's so you can have two
people<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.879> here<00:02:33.030> at<00:02:33.120> once<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.470> little

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
people in here at once and it's a little

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.470 
people in here at once and it's a little
faulty<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> don't<00:02:35.910> recommend<00:02:36.000> actually

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
faulty so I don't recommend actually

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.300 
faulty so I don't recommend actually
building<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.140> because<00:02:37.379> you'll<00:02:38.010> hit<00:02:38.190> each

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
building it because you'll hit each

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.150 
building it because you'll hit each
other<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:38.940> won't<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.239> as<00:02:39.329> high<00:02:40.160> I'm

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
other and then you won't go as high I'm

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.330 
other and then you won't go as high I'm
just<00:02:41.370> gonna<00:02:41.489> stand<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.000> middle<00:02:43.340> activate

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just gonna stand in the middle activate

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.380 
just gonna stand in the middle activate
this<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.970> we're<00:02:45.599> at<00:02:45.690> Y<00:02:45.959> 11<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.519> let's<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.180> we

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this and we're at Y 11 and let's see we

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.860 
this and we're at Y 11 and let's see we
go<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.989> 60<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.879> that's<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> 49<00:02:51.540> block

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
go up to 60 so that's a 49 block

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.920 
go up to 60 so that's a 49 block
increase<00:02:52.349> not<00:02:53.190> as<00:02:53.340> much<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:53.730> Mach<00:02:53.940> 3<00:02:54.299> but<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.780> is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
increase not as much as Mach 3 but it is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.479 
increase not as much as Mach 3 but it is
two-person<00:02:55.890> accessible<00:02:57.769> over<00:02:58.769> here<00:02:59.160> at<00:02:59.250> Mach

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
two-person accessible over here at Mach

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.650 
two-person accessible over here at Mach
5<00:03:00.799> well<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.010> changed<00:03:02.370> was<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.819> made<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.420> that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
5 well I changed was I made this that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:12.860 
5 well I changed was I made this that
you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:04.019> have<00:03:05.450> two<00:03:06.450> layers<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.840> TNT<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:11.870> ok

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you can have two layers of TNT and ok

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.110 
you can have two layers of TNT and ok
more<00:03:13.109> TNT<00:03:13.349> more<00:03:13.709> power<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.700> let's<00:03:14.879> see<00:03:15.030> how

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
more TNT more power so let's see how

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.430 
more TNT more power so let's see how
this<00:03:15.239> works<00:03:15.450> out<00:03:15.629> we<00:03:15.810> are<00:03:15.989> at<00:03:16.170> 11<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:18.260> we<00:03:19.260> will

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
this works out we are at 11 and we will

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.610 
this works out we are at 11 and we will
get<00:03:19.650> up<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:21.079> 96<00:03:23.480> almost<00:03:24.480> hitting<00:03:24.870> our<00:03:25.079> little

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
get up to 96 almost hitting our little

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.849 
get up to 96 almost hitting our little
station<00:03:25.980> there<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.139> actually<00:03:28.530> only<00:03:28.709> went

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
station there so that actually only went

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:38.059 
station there so that actually only went
two<00:03:29.220> blocks<00:03:29.250> farther<00:03:29.750> than<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:33.120> one<00:03:34.109> um<00:03:37.069> yeah

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
two blocks farther than the one um yeah

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.509 
two blocks farther than the one um yeah
the<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.400> deep<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:39.049> then<00:03:40.049> my<00:03:40.169> friend

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
the one deep and then my friend

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.740 
the one deep and then my friend
suggested<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.639> me<00:03:42.889> that<00:03:43.889> he<00:03:44.569> added<00:03:45.569> an

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
suggested to me that he added an

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.460 
suggested to me that he added an
additional<00:03:46.230> row<00:03:46.470> outside<00:03:47.630> now<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.349> was

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
additional row outside now and I was

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.250 
additional row outside now and I was
thinking<00:03:49.639> okay<00:03:50.639> I'll<00:03:51.299> try<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.569> see<00:03:52.079> how<00:03:52.169> it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
thinking okay I'll try that see how it

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.710 
thinking okay I'll try that see how it
works<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.859> this<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.970> best<00:03:54.150> working<00:03:54.389> one

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
works and this is the best working one

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.210 
works and this is the best working one
by<00:03:55.230> far<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.579> if<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:58.440> want<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.680> build<00:03:58.829> this<00:03:59.010> I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
by far and if you want to build this I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.170 
by far and if you want to build this I
recommend<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.700> have<00:03:59.730> this<00:03:59.940> whole<00:04:00.150> area<00:04:00.889> um

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
recommend you have this whole area um

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.940 
recommend you have this whole area um
flat<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.230> build<00:04:04.379> out<00:04:04.560> here

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
flat like this so you can build out here

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.680 
flat like this so you can build out here
but<00:04:05.579> just<00:04:05.760> don't<00:04:05.940> build<00:04:06.980> above<00:04:07.980> here<00:04:08.430> or<00:04:08.849> else

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
but just don't build above here or else

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.140 
but just don't build above here or else
the<00:04:09.959> blast<00:04:10.169> won't<00:04:10.349> be<00:04:10.560> concentrated<00:04:11.340> don't

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
the blast won't be concentrated don't

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.360 
the blast won't be concentrated don't
know<00:04:12.269> why<00:04:12.419> like<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.319> physics<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:13.980> Minecraft

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
know why like the physics and Minecraft

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.490 
know why like the physics and Minecraft
just<00:04:14.549> work<00:04:14.699> that<00:04:14.879> way<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:16.019> if<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.139> just<00:04:16.320> stand

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
just work that way so if you just stand

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.349 
just work that way so if you just stand
in<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.769> center<00:04:17.099> oh<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.880> might<00:04:18.060> want<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.269> see

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
in the center oh you might want to see

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.510 
in the center oh you might want to see
your<00:04:18.449> redstone<00:04:19.789> so<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.909> Redstone<00:04:21.329> goes

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
your redstone so the Redstone goes

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.820 
your redstone so the Redstone goes
into<00:04:23.120> here<00:04:23.419> for<00:04:23.660> this<00:04:23.780> layer<00:04:24.020> with<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:26.830> repeater

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
into here for this layer with a repeater

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.309 
into here for this layer with a repeater
set<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.850> third<00:04:29.090> delay<00:04:30.520> yeah<00:04:31.520> third<00:04:31.789> delay

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
set on the third delay yeah third delay

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.870 
set on the third delay yeah third delay
depends<00:04:33.319> how<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.470> look<00:04:33.620> at<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.550> this

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
depends how you look at it so that this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.200 
depends how you look at it so that this
is<00:04:35.060> all<00:04:35.150> timed<00:04:35.479> almost<00:04:35.990> exactly<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:38.030> goes

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
is all timed almost exactly that goes

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.100 
is all timed almost exactly that goes
down<00:04:38.419> here<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.020> with<00:04:39.710> some<00:04:39.919> redstone<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:41.780> gets

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
down here and with some redstone it gets

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.029 
down here and with some redstone it gets
up<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.740> activates<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:44.000> middle<00:04:44.300> row<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.800> we're

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
up and activates the middle row so we're

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.950 
up and activates the middle row so we're
just<00:04:49.069> gonna<00:04:49.490> get<00:04:49.849> on<00:04:50.060> here<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:50.569> want<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.810> be<00:04:50.870> in

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
just gonna get on here you want to be in

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.589 
just gonna get on here you want to be in
the<00:04:51.050> dead<00:04:51.229> center<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:52.120> then<00:04:53.120> notice<00:04:53.360> we're<00:04:53.479> at

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
the dead center and then notice we're at

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:06.990 
the dead center and then notice we're at
y12<00:04:54.259> well<00:04:55.220> just<00:04:56.289> behold<00:04:57.289> how<00:04:57.500> high<00:04:57.680> we<00:04:57.800> get<00:05:03.039> 256

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.659 

256<00:05:08.000> blocks<00:05:08.210> high<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:08.810> it<00:05:08.900> takes<00:05:09.139> me<00:05:09.349> about<00:05:09.669> 10

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
256 blocks high and it takes me about 10

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.589 
256 blocks high and it takes me about 10
seconds<00:05:11.300> after<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.960> launch<00:05:12.169> to<00:05:12.440> fall<00:05:12.620> back

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
seconds after the launch to fall back

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.659 
seconds after the launch to fall back
you<00:05:14.599> could<00:05:14.780> use<00:05:15.080> this<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.620> get<00:05:15.979> from<00:05:16.250> bedrock

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
you could use this to get from bedrock

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.969 
you could use this to get from bedrock
to<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.120> new<00:05:17.419> height<00:05:17.840> limit<00:05:18.259> in<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.740> next

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
to the new height limit in the next

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.020 
to the new height limit in the next
update<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:23.090> just<00:05:23.300> barely<00:05:23.690> make<00:05:23.960> it

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
update and just barely make it

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.159 
update and just barely make it
essentially<00:05:26.500> how<00:05:27.500> amazing<00:05:28.130> is<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:29.020> all<00:05:30.020> it

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
essentially how amazing is that all it

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.570 
essentially how amazing is that all it
