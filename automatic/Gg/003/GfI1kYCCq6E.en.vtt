00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
though there are tag teams in the game

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.650 
though there are tag teams in the game
it's<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.609> silliest<00:04:18.940> thing<00:04:19.030> I've<00:04:19.120> ever<00:04:19.209> heard<00:04:19.450> of

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
it's a silliest thing I've ever heard of

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
voice will stick bright enough so the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.440 
voice will stick bright enough so the
WAF<00:04:21.820> title<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:29.850> mean<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:30.940> think<00:04:31.000> everyone<00:04:31.300> would

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
WAF title I mean I think everyone would

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.940 
WAF title I mean I think everyone would
have<00:04:31.570> gladly<00:04:31.750> substituted<00:04:32.470> all<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.800> modes

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
have gladly substituted all the modes

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.260 
have gladly substituted all the modes
they<00:04:33.100> left<00:04:33.250> out<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.700> mini<00:04:33.850> movies<00:04:34.150> or

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
they left out for the mini movies or

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.150 
they left out for the mini movies or
sound<00:04:34.479> clips<00:04:34.750> well<00:04:35.500> 20<00:04:35.710> guys<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.950> could<00:04:36.070> have

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
sound clips well 20 guys you could have

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.010 
sound clips well 20 guys you could have
had<00:04:36.250> some<00:04:36.400> epic<00:04:36.669> Royal<00:04:36.910> Rumbles<00:04:37.210> by<00:04:37.870> my

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
had some epic Royal Rumbles by my

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.210 
had some epic Royal Rumbles by my
estimation<00:04:38.350> there<00:04:38.620> are<00:04:38.680> two<00:04:38.830> hundred<00:04:39.070> ten

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
estimation there are two hundred ten

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.370 
estimation there are two hundred ten
possible<00:04:39.610> tag-team<00:04:40.000> combinations<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.080> six

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
possible tag-team combinations and six

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.710 
possible tag-team combinations and six
million<00:04:41.560> Survivor<00:04:41.950> Series<00:04:42.160> teams<00:04:42.600> they<00:04:43.600> had

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
million Survivor Series teams they had

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.790 
million Survivor Series teams they had
left<00:04:43.840> all<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.380> probably<00:04:44.620> had<00:04:44.710> been

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
left all that in and probably had been

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.140 
left all that in and probably had been
the<00:04:44.890> best<00:04:45.070> game<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.370> series<00:04:45.610> but

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
the best game in the series but

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.450 
the best game in the series but
ultimately<00:04:46.510> falls<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.840> bit<00:04:46.870> short<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:47.410> have<00:04:48.340> to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
ultimately falls a bit short you have to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.219 
ultimately falls a bit short you have to
buy<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> Sega<00:04:48.910> CD<00:04:49.210> system<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.600> play<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.020> can't

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
buy a Sega CD system to play it I can't

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.840 
buy a Sega CD system to play it I can't
really<00:04:50.320> recommend<00:04:50.500> hunting<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.040> down<00:04:51.220> unless

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
really recommend hunting it down unless

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.360 
really recommend hunting it down unless
the<00:04:52.060> solo<00:04:52.270> throws<00:04:52.540> in<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.690> copy<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:53.050> sewer<00:04:53.229> shark

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
the solo throws in a copy of sewer shark

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.440 
the solo throws in a copy of sewer shark
better<00:04:54.370> off<00:04:54.520> sticking<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.910> Royal<00:04:55.150> Rumble<00:04:55.390> a
