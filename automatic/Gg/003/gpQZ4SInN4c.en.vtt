 worst year saw doña the truth is not 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.219
 It is necessary for you to take charge 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 publicly with the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.949

 of a difficult year that we continue 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 going through a difficult year and the truth 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.949
 is that my voice broke when 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 I hear this the note of primiciasya me 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.730
 It hurt a lot, I think I did not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.100
 I deserved that Susana already said a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.530
 production meeting that I say what 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.960
 I am affected by amphetamines the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 I really would not want to know 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 and I think you do not do him a favor 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 filtering this kind of thing and that is what 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.970
 he said let alone putting them in his 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.610
 mouth 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.000
 if he did not even say it no no no 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.210
 do not 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.710
 I am without the voice of the screams I swear not 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.230
 you know me and you know that I am a person 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.990
 rather quiet and that rather 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.990
 suppresses the anger that the long 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.960
 with the talk in such a violent way 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.749
 with that squeeze he pulled me out his 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 alienated I recognize him he was screaming 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.570
 I was screaming I was without voice is very 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.600
 unpleasant 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's very violent to feel tight is 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.370
 violent feeling tight all that 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.860
 I said it is strictly true I swear by 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.040
 my daughter for my dad who are the most 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.600
 important that I have I do not want to cry 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.630
 victimize me in doing great pleasure with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.869
 this but 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.990
 The truth is that it hurt me also because of 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.570
 who was coming because he is a person to the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.240
 What I want and I still want is not anger 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.490
 pain what moves me what wants us 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.950
 worried is that we suspect they have 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.720
 tear to puncture so keep with the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.460
 minor of the little sisters calabró because 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.970

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.929
 camera and do that how were your 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.929

 I appreciate what you said already as 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.340
 it's like being in the desert and having 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 severe that I never experienced it 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.750
 not only because of the relationship with Liliana but 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.750
 by the rule crying a month ago 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.740

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.430
 Oh 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.180
 it's as if at some point in this 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.610
 moment if you had to stop it 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.890

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.120

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.310
 they mean I explain what things in that 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.450
 moment it was as if for a while someone 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.800
 I would have taken the backpack out of the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.040
 back the farm one side 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.960

 camera cameras can everything 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.739
 it's also so much interest waiting to go out 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.190
 to air if there is no other way to do 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.190
 journalism 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.129
 dressed as a vedette 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.599

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.550
