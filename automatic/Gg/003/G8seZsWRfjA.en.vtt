00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.970 
these studs are very very flexible
they're<00:03:12.299> very<00:03:12.420> similar<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.170> evo<00:03:13.680> speeds

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
they're very similar to the evo speeds

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.430 
they're very similar to the evo speeds

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
from from puma it kind of gets you a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.509 
from from puma it kind of gets you a
better<00:03:16.680> better<00:03:17.100> look<00:03:17.609> right<00:03:17.820> here<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:20.400> can

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
better better look right here you can

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.449 
better better look right here you can
kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.760> see<00:03:21.350> how<00:03:22.350> flexible<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.950> studies<00:03:23.310> as

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
kind of see how flexible that studies as

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.590 
kind of see how flexible that studies as
you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.700> send<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.150> moving<00:03:24.359> back<00:03:24.480> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
you can send a see it's moving back and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.940 
you can send a see it's moving back and
forth<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:25.620> about<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:27.230> fingernail<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.500> length

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
forth there about a fingernail in length

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.710 
forth there about a fingernail in length
obviously<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.970> depends<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.390> hand<00:03:30.570> but

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
obviously it depends in your hand but

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.539 
obviously it depends in your hand but
they're<00:03:31.109> not<00:03:31.230> very<00:03:31.440> big<00:03:31.530> trying<00:03:32.310> out<00:03:32.400> what

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
they're not very big trying out what

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.860 
they're not very big trying out what
kind<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.090> point<00:03:33.239> we're<00:03:33.480> trying<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.690> prove

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
kind of the point we're trying to prove

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.530 
kind of the point we're trying to prove
on<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.320> they're<00:03:35.310> very<00:03:35.670> very<00:03:35.910> short<00:03:36.299> kind

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
on this is they're very very short kind

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.319 
on this is they're very very short kind
of<00:03:36.600> chop<00:03:36.810> your<00:03:36.989> studs<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.500> don't<00:03:37.890> notice<00:03:38.010> any

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
of chop your studs I don't notice any

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.580 
of chop your studs I don't notice any
uncomfortable<00:03:39.329> stud<00:03:39.780> pressure<00:03:40.049> with<00:03:40.260> these<00:03:40.410> I

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
uncomfortable stud pressure with these I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.190 
uncomfortable stud pressure with these I
found<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.700> 360-degree<00:03:42.480> stud

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
found that the 360-degree stud

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.630 
found that the 360-degree stud
configuration<00:03:43.320> kind<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.160> gives<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> little

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
configuration kind of gives you a little

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.190 
configuration kind of gives you a little
bit<00:03:44.820> better<00:03:44.910> movement<00:03:45.359> as<00:03:45.630> far<00:03:45.840> as<00:03:45.989> as

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
bit better movement as far as as

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.440 
bit better movement as far as as
laterally<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.220> felt<00:03:47.670> like<00:03:47.760> they<00:03:47.850> held<00:03:48.090> my<00:03:48.239> foot

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
laterally I felt like they held my foot

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.360 
laterally I felt like they held my foot
a<00:03:48.480> little<00:03:48.540> bit<00:03:48.810> nicer<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.920> they<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.220> they

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
a little bit nicer and they just they

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.440 
a little bit nicer and they just they
really<00:03:50.579> don't<00:03:50.760> give<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.060> any<00:03:51.180> type<00:03:51.420> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
really don't give you any type of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.150 
really don't give you any type of
negative<00:03:52.109> pressure<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:52.980> that's

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
negative pressure at all so that's

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.460 
negative pressure at all so that's
definite<00:03:54.150> definite<00:03:54.810> advantage<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.320> these

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
definite definite advantage with these

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.229 
definite definite advantage with these
even<00:03:55.950> though<00:03:56.040> they<00:03:56.130> are<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> little<00:03:56.430> bit<00:03:56.609> lower

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
even though they are a little bit lower

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.170 
even though they are a little bit lower
and<00:03:57.569> stud<00:03:57.890> length<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.579> feel<00:03:59.790> like<00:03:59.910> sometimes

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
and stud length so I feel like sometimes

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.840 
and stud length so I feel like sometimes
you're<00:04:00.540> sacrificing<00:04:00.900> traction<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.920> do<00:04:02.549> feel

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
you're sacrificing traction I do feel

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.340 
you're sacrificing traction I do feel
that<00:04:02.880> way<00:04:03.090> with<00:04:03.239> these<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.390> little<00:04:03.750> bit<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.079> as

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
that way with these a little bit but as

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.809 
that way with these a little bit but as
far<00:04:04.620> as<00:04:04.680> comfort<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.250> as<00:04:05.310> far<00:04:05.430> as<00:04:05.549> movement

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
far as comfort and as far as movement

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.960 
far as comfort and as far as movement
there<00:04:06.750> they're<00:04:07.079> definitely<00:04:07.500> top<00:04:07.859> notch<00:04:08.100> as

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
there they're definitely top notch as

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.050 
there they're definitely top notch as
far<00:04:09.150> as<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.329> bottoms<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.840> them<00:04:09.959> some<00:04:11.060> overall

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
these i've owned them for a few months

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.099 
these i've owned them for a few months
now<00:04:17.459> I'm<00:04:18.209> played<00:04:18.510> in<00:04:18.630> them<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.810> pretty<00:04:18.989> bad

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
now I'm played in them in pretty bad

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.110 
now I'm played in them in pretty bad
weather<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.650> played<00:04:19.979> with<00:04:20.070> them<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.459> fair

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
