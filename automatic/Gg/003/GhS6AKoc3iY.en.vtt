is now ready to use and while we do a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.910 
is now ready to use and while we do a
test<00:03:43.180> I'll<00:03:43.450> explain<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.140> mobs<00:03:44.380> take<00:03:44.680> damage

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
test I'll explain the mobs take damage

this means that when we use the crusher

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.600 
this means that when we use the crusher
a<00:03:49.569> very<00:03:49.900> small<00:03:50.170> percentage<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.739> mobs<00:03:50.980> will<00:03:51.190> die
