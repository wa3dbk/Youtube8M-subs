00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.349 
but no bass the fifty-fifth these are a
little<00:04:13.209> sharp<00:04:13.889> but<00:04:14.889> they're<00:04:15.639> really<00:04:15.880> stylish

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
little sharp but they're really stylish

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.099 
little sharp but they're really stylish
and<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.549> really<00:04:18.549> like<00:04:18.729> them<00:04:18.910> but<00:04:19.120> they<00:04:19.959> have

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
and I really like them but they have

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.920 
and I really like them but they have
heavier<00:04:20.560> bass<00:04:20.859> they<00:04:21.220> have<00:04:21.340> heavy<00:04:21.579> bass<00:04:21.930> but

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
heavier bass they have heavy bass but

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.010 
heavier bass they have heavy bass but
little<00:04:23.830> sharp<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:25.050> fixes<00:04:26.050> they<00:04:26.590> are<00:04:28.020> better

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
little sharp the fixes they are better

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.560 
little sharp the fixes they are better
they<00:04:29.590> have<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.889> heaviest<00:04:30.340> pace<00:04:30.789> out<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.389> those

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
they have the heaviest pace out of those

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.670 
they have the heaviest pace out of those
two<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.669> just<00:04:34.630> think<00:04:34.780> they're<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.200> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
two and I just think they're like the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.460 
two and I just think they're like the
best<00:04:35.919> headphones<00:04:36.700> I've<00:04:37.060> ever<00:04:37.180> had<00:04:37.360> but<00:04:38.169> other

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.760 
than that the fixes is 50/50 smoking
pots<00:04:44.770> -<00:04:45.240> they<00:04:46.240> were<00:04:46.300> good<00:04:47.229> they<00:04:47.260> have<00:04:47.530> nice

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.129 
pots - they were good they have nice
style<00:04:48.099> but<00:04:48.340> they<00:04:48.460> sounded<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:49.510> worst<00:04:49.720> that

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
style but they sounded the worst that

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.159

they<00:04:50.919> sound<00:04:51.130> good<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:51.729> they're<00:04:52.419> not<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.780> best

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
they sound good but they're not the best

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.940 
they sound good but they're not the best
they're<00:04:53.560> still<00:04:53.800> worth<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.130> price<00:04:54.310> though

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
they're still worth the price though

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
those were the worst ones

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.300 
those were the worst ones
third<00:04:59.650> place<00:04:59.949> was<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:02.020> 1550s<00:05:02.530> they<00:05:02.949> were<00:05:03.070> kind
