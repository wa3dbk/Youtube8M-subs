experience we can for the playstation 3

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.730 
experience we can for the playstation 3
so<00:01:47.430> we're<00:01:48.119> adding<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.049> again<00:01:49.500> we're

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so we're adding in you know again we're

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.460 
so we're adding in you know again we're
focusing<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.670> tight<00:01:51.140> close<00:01:52.140> quarters

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
focusing on really tight close quarters

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
focusing on really tight close quarters
combat<00:01:52.500> we're<00:01:53.159> also<00:01:53.340> using<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.820> sixaxis

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
combat we're also using the sixaxis

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.080 
combat we're also using the sixaxis
controller<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.079> very<00:01:55.259> unique<00:01:55.530> ways<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.189> using

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
controller and very unique ways so using

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
controller and very unique ways so using
the<00:01:57.180> sixaxis<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.930> sort<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> very

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the sixaxis we sort of have a very

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
the sixaxis we sort of have a very
dynamic<00:01:58.979> cover<00:01:59.610> system<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.360> you're<00:02:00.630> moving

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
dynamic cover system so as you're moving

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
dynamic cover system so as you're moving
through<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.140> level<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:01.890> any<00:02:02.159> object

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
through the level you can use any object

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.249 
through the level you can use any object
in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> level<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.299> cover<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.140> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
in the level as cover you don't have to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.289 
in the level as cover you don't have to
snap<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.210> biting<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
snap to it and just biting the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
snap to it and just biting the
controller<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
controller as you see there on the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.830 
controller as you see there on the
screen<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.550> very<00:02:08.789> dynamically<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.720> then

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
screen you can very dynamically and then

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
screen you can very dynamically and then
in<00:02:09.959> very<00:02:10.170> analog

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
in very analog

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.000 
in very analog
or<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.120> sort<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.510> use<00:02:12.750> anything<00:02:13.110> as<00:02:13.410> cover<00:02:13.710> is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
or just sort of use anything as cover is

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.880 
or just sort of use anything as cover is
very<00:02:14.490> intuitive<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:16.380> don't<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.710> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
very intuitive it's you don't have to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.860 
very intuitive it's you don't have to
pop<00:02:17.100> out<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.340> certain<00:02:17.910> distance<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.600> just

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
pop out to certain distance you can just

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.750 
pop out to certain distance you can just
lean<00:02:19.230> out<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> little<00:02:19.710> bit<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.640> can

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
lean out a little bit or a lot you can

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
lean out a little bit or a lot you can
adjust<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.540> down<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.020> we're<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.350> using

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
adjust up and down so we're really using

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.790 
adjust up and down so we're really using
the<00:02:22.770> sixaxis<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.670> very<00:02:23.820> meaningful<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:24.800> is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the sixaxis and very meaningful way is

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.300 
the sixaxis and very meaningful way is
that<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> only<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.720> big<00:02:27.930> control<00:02:28.440> taco<00:02:28.980> is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that the only the big control taco is

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.730 
that the only the big control taco is
that<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:30.000> more<00:02:30.240> control<00:02:31.140> tweaks<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
that is there more control tweaks we can

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.270 
that is there more control tweaks we can
we<00:02:32.070> can<00:02:32.190> discuss<00:02:32.520> well<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.510> are<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:34.830> switch<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
we can discuss well we are we switch the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.530 
we can discuss well we are we switch the
game<00:02:35.430> over<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.820> sort<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.420> an

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
game over to sort of an

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.940 
game over to sort of an
over-the-shoulder<00:02:37.050> camera<00:02:37.710> perspective

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
over-the-shoulder camera perspective

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.440 
over-the-shoulder camera perspective
from<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.520> previous<00:02:38.880> games<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.300> still

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
from the previous games that we still

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.050 
from the previous games that we still
have<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> old<00:02:39.750> view<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.350> well<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.610> also<00:02:41.790> we

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
have the old view as well but also we

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060 
have the old view as well but also we
are<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.540> tweaked<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.990> we<00:02:43.170> added<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.830> quick

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
are we tweaked it we added in a quick

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.680 
are we tweaked it we added in a quick
grenade<00:02:44.430> throw<00:02:44.700> button<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.300> based<00:02:45.510> on

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
grenade throw button which is based on

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.290 
grenade throw button which is based on
how<00:02:45.870> hard<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.350> throw<00:02:46.380> push<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> button<00:02:47.490> so

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
how hard you throw push on the button so

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.510 
how hard you throw push on the button so
previous<00:02:49.170> games<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.830> come<00:02:50.190> out<00:02:50.370> with

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
previous games you have to come out with

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.220 
previous games you have to come out with
a<00:02:50.550> narc<00:02:50.850> which<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.360> still<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.810> which<00:02:51.990> allows

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
a narc which we still have which allows

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.980 
a narc which we still have which allows
you<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> do<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:53.209> precise<00:02:54.209> grenade<00:02:54.660> throws

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
you to do really precise grenade throws

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.870 
you to do really precise grenade throws
but<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.380> also<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:56.010> hit<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> button<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
but you can also just hit the button and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.780 
but you can also just hit the button and
throw<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.240> quickly<00:02:57.590> but<00:02:58.590> also<00:02:58.950> we're<00:02:59.370> using

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
throw it quickly but also we're using

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.150 
throw it quickly but also we're using
the<00:03:00.180> sixaxis<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:01.230> sort<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.560> determine<00:03:01.800> whether

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the sixaxis to sort of determine whether

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.590 
the sixaxis to sort of determine whether
or<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:02.400> you're<00:03:02.580> going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> do<00:03:02.880> an<00:03:02.970> underhand

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
or not you're going to do an underhand

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.990 
or not you're going to do an underhand
or<00:03:03.780> roll<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> grenade<00:03:04.709> or<00:03:04.920> an<00:03:05.280> overhand<00:03:05.790> so

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
or roll of the grenade or an overhand so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.370 
or roll of the grenade or an overhand so
if<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.180> tilt<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> controller<00:03:06.840> down<00:03:07.050> when<00:03:07.290> you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
if you tilt the controller down when you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.500 
if you tilt the controller down when you
throw<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:08.220> does<00:03:08.430> an<00:03:08.550> underhand<00:03:08.970> roll<00:03:09.240> if

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
throw it it does an underhand roll if

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.360 
throw it it does an underhand roll if
you<00:03:09.930> tilt<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> controller<00:03:10.890> up<00:03:11.100> when<00:03:11.280> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you tilt the controller up when you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.130 
you tilt the controller up when you
throw<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.730> doesn't<00:03:11.880> overhand<00:03:12.330> roll<00:03:12.540> you
