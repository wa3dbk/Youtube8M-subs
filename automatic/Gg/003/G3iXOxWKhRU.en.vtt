00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
wasn't in modern warfare 2 because they

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
onto the battlefield and for me I feel

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
onto the battlefield and for me I feel
like<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.160> strong<00:00:44.460> because

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
like this one is very strong because

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670

say<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.219> assault<00:00:47.520> rifle<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.090> better<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
say in assault rifle it's better to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.209 
say in assault rifle it's better to
actually<00:00:48.570> build<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.079> whole<00:00:49.500> perk<00:00:49.860> system

and your equipment around using the

and your equipment around using the
assault<00:00:53.160> rifle<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.000> confuse<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> with

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
assault rifle if you confuse it with

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.540

another<00:00:54.989> type<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.410> weapon<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> sniper<00:00:56.280> eye

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
for an LMG then you're kind of just not

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
for an LMG then you're kind of just not

good combination in search-and-destroy

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.670

to<00:01:15.240> start<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> sniper<00:01:16.020> rifle<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to start off with a sniper rifle and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
to start off with a sniper rifle and
then<00:01:16.830> maybe<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> submachine<00:01:17.700> gun<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:18.450> the

close quarters engagements happened at
the<00:01:20.490> end<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.150> general<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.720> tend<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> think

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the end but in general I tend to think

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
the end but in general I tend to think
this<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.500> isn't<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:22.920> useful<00:01:23.220> perk

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this just isn't a very useful perk

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.399 
this just isn't a very useful perk
sounds<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.270> paper<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.689> practically

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
sounds good on paper but practically

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.420 
sounds good on paper but practically
just<00:01:25.950> isn't<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.340> great

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.770 

at<00:01:31.430> number<00:01:31.790> four<00:01:31.970> I've<00:01:32.060> decided<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.540> go<00:01:32.750> with

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
at number four I've decided to go with

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.289 
at number four I've decided to go with
hardwired<00:01:33.470> from<00:01:33.710> black<00:01:33.950> ops<00:01:34.159> 2<00:01:34.490> now<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:35.030> perk

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
hardwired from black ops 2 now this perk

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.359 
hardwired from black ops 2 now this perk
allowed<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.930> immunity<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.890> counter<00:01:37.190> UAV

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369

this<00:03:17.019> isn't<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.380> worst<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:17.890> little<00:03:18.160> bit

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
this isn't the worst one little bit

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.130 
this isn't the worst one little bit
confusing<00:03:18.640> but<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.209> general<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:19.810> never

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
confusing but in general it's never

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.199 
confusing but in general it's never

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
outweighed by the fact that the enemy's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.130 
outweighed by the fact that the enemy's
UAV<00:03:26.920> radar<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.519> scrambled<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.300> I've<00:03:28.750> gone<00:03:28.959> for

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
UAV radar is scrambled so I've gone for

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.250 
UAV radar is scrambled so I've gone for
number<00:03:29.380> three<00:03:29.620> scrambler<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:33.870> number<00:03:34.870> two<00:03:35.049> I've

number three scrambler a number two I've

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.140 
number three scrambler a number two I've
decided<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.739> go<00:03:35.890> with<00:03:35.920> shades<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:36.970> was<00:03:37.120> a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
decided to go with shades now this was a

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.210 
decided to go with shades now this was a
perk<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.720> call<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:38.079> duty<00:03:38.380> world<00:03:38.560> at<00:03:38.739> war<00:03:38.799> and

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
perk in call of duty world at war and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.470 
perk in call of duty world at war and
the<00:03:39.310> reason<00:03:39.519> this<00:03:39.579> perk<00:03:39.820> was<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.299> is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
the reason this perk was in it is

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.270 
the reason this perk was in it is
because<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.079> had<00:03:41.260> signal<00:03:41.739> flares<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.130> that

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
because you had signal flares in that

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.590 
because you had signal flares in that
game<00:03:42.489> which<00:03:42.730> were<00:03:42.910> these<00:03:43.060> flares<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.510> you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
game which were these flares that you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.270 
game which were these flares that you
threw<00:03:43.840> out<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.410> they<00:03:44.470> had<00:03:44.680> like<00:03:44.829> a<00:03:44.860> bright

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
threw out and they had like a bright

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.860 
threw out and they had like a bright
light<00:03:45.310> surrounding<00:03:46.209> them<00:03:46.360> made<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.630> difficult

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
light surrounding them made it difficult

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.410 
light surrounding them made it difficult
to<00:03:47.230> see<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:48.040> again<00:03:48.250> on<00:03:48.640> paper<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.180> poke

doesn't<00:03:49.660> sound<00:03:49.840> too<00:03:50.019> bad<00:03:50.049> that's<00:03:50.470> not<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> bad

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890

similarly to the last perk 99 times out
of<00:03:58.930> 100<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.829> game<00:04:00.040> you're<00:04:00.250> not<00:04:00.400> really<00:04:00.640> going

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
of 100 in a game you're not really going

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.970 
of 100 in a game you're not really going
to<00:04:00.820> be<00:04:00.970> affected<00:04:01.450> by<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.660> signal<00:04:02.170> flare<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.799> it's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
to be affected by a signal flare so it's

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.130 
to be affected by a signal flare so it's
much<00:04:03.310> more<00:04:03.640> kind<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.090> desirable<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.930> take<00:04:05.109> a

much more kind of desirable to take a

perk that's gonna be working for you a

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.729 
perk that's gonna be working for you a
lot<00:04:07.299> more<00:04:07.570> of<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.870> time<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.260> know<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.470> actual

usage<00:04:08.950> of<00:04:09.250> this<00:04:09.400> perk<00:04:09.609> isn't<00:04:09.940> terrible<00:04:10.359> but<00:04:10.570> in

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
usage of this perk isn't terrible but in

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.960 
usage of this perk isn't terrible but in
practical<00:04:11.530> senses<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.160> kind<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.670> because

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
practical senses it kind of is because

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.789 
practical senses it kind of is because
if<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.299> only<00:04:13.450> had<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.810> shades<00:04:14.140> perk<00:04:14.530> setup

to the previous perks its abilities and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.170 
to the previous perks its abilities and
actually<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.860> bad<00:04:42.130> it's<00:04:42.430> just<00:04:42.490> not<00:04:42.730> useful

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
actually that bad it's just not useful

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.660 
actually that bad it's just not useful
at<00:04:43.570> all<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.470> gave<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.100> ability<00:04:45.220> to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
at all so this gave you the ability to

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.450 
at all so this gave you the ability to
hear<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.330> other<00:04:46.540> team's<00:04:47.460> communications

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
via voice if you were close to them now

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.560 
via voice if you were close to them now
obviously<00:04:51.820> when<00:04:51.970> they<00:04:52.090> were<00:04:52.180> kind<00:04:52.510> of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
obviously when they were kind of

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.940 
obviously when they were kind of
conjuring<00:04:52.930> this<00:04:53.080> up<00:04:53.260> they<00:04:53.440> thought<00:04:53.620> they<00:04:53.830> had

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
the same perk slot of this so you would

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.470 
the same perk slot of this so you would
never<00:05:24.220> really<00:05:24.550> want<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.820> use<00:05:25.030> this<00:05:25.180> again

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
never really want to use this again

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.360

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
maybe even insert and destroy you might

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.650 
maybe even insert and destroy you might
try<00:05:27.640> it<00:05:27.760> out<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.060> that's<00:05:28.180> used<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.420> be<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:28.510> bit
