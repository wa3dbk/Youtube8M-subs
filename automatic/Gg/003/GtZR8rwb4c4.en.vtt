00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 and start the issue with news that 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.250
 Today they say absolutely in all 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
 corners of the country 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.540
 National Bank of Kazakhstan unexpectedly spent 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.480
 devaluation of tenge for dollar 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.049
 in all exchangers of the country instead of 150 5 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.270
 tenge now asking 185 imitated 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.730
 other euro currencies are worth more 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 two hundred and fifty a Russian ruble 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.330
 five and a half tenge explain why 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 there was a devaluation of the national 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.710
 currency today tried to head personally 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.199
 National Bank Kairat Kelimbetov called immediately 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.510
 five reasons alexey angler attentively 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.290
 listened and tried to understand what 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.130
 Now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.130
 keep money 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 and you can not buy the euro dollar 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.329
 buy no dollars and euros closed 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.170
 lack of currency exchangers and bouncing 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.820
 numbers on the scoreboard 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 this picture was observed today 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 in almost all regions of the country 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.540
 currency rates began to fever itself 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 am for 1 dollar instead of the usual 155 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.000
 tenge first asked for 160 then 180 a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.519
 some places and all 200 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 I thought that there is a timer lying or something 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 or that tonic hoof failure occurred 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.700
 just a few minutes ago that's all 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.280
 it was extinct as if now we 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.080
 Already come such good courses 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 closer to dinner with official 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.020
 an explanation appeared chapter 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.820
 National Bank Kairat Kelimbetov 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 told that the decision to hold 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 devaluation taken officially out 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.460
 Today, Kazakhstanis need 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 will get used to the new exchange rate 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 say about this before the main banker 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.340
 could not have shocking news to him 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 most allegedly reported only this night 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.660
 and devaluation in general 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.250
 Kerimbekova is good for the country 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.110
 we believe that the equilibrium rate of tenge 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.310
 is the new exchange rate level 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.709
 with a bang for about 185 tenge per dollar 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:57.560
 I personally found out about it last night 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:02:00.060
 this morning, workers learned about it 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.580
 who were supposed to notify you that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.470
 we are collecting you believe that this is us for now 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.009
 good for all of us for the economy 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.360
 Kazakhstan and in this regard 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.459
 some kind of contradiction with the previous ones 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 We do not see statements by the Kelimbetov. 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 immediately five reasons forced 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 depreciation of tenge among them fall 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.110
 national currencies in other countries 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.540
 the first is that the situation is in all 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.190
 developing countries in particular in 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 brix countries generally speaks about 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.780
 the weakening of these currencies of these countries 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.230
 against the us dollar in the second 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.510
 uncertainty remains 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.060
 regarding the Russian exchange rate 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.640
 ruble third of payments 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.010
 balance creating prerequisites for 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.810
 reducing inflation to three four 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.910
 percent medium term 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.040
 in addition, the head of the National Bank to accuse 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.870
 what is happening and they are ordinary Kazakhstanis 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.740
 supposedly themselves pumped up the situation 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.480
 too se 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.550
 waited for depreciation because of what on 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.740
 foreign exchange market began speculation but 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.750
 economists fear that the new dollar 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.280
 marks for a long time did not stay cheap 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 today tenge and outside of Kazakhstan 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.870
 in Bishkek in the morning, too, convulsively changed 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.150
 signs in exchange offices if over 100 tenge 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.580
 30 volumes sank there before now 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.190
 you can buy our currency in just 20 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.660
 the usual number 155 on the scoreboard exchange 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.190
 Kazakhstanis will not see the points 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.930
 today dramatically increased the price is not 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.790
 only the dollar but the euro and the Russian ruble 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.230
 and other currencies while calling 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.090
 promises to tightly control exchange 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.310
 points the difference between buying and selling 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.410
 the case of the dollar should not exceed 2 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.300
 tenge case of sevre 3 those who will not 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.730
 to comply with these rules may even deprive 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.510
 licenses to call assures that the situation 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.160
 in the foreign exchange market 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 should stabilize in the coming days 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.030
 and American money in all exchangers 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.280
 countries will cost about the same 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.020
 185 tenge for 1 dollar
