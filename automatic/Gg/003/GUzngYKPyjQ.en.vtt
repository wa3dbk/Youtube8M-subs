follow<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.760> Norfolk<00:00:27.330> Southern<00:00:27.869> GP<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.680> tea<00:00:28.830> as

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
follow a Norfolk Southern GP for tea as

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
follow a Norfolk Southern GP for tea as
it<00:00:29.189> switches<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> yarn<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.779> guys

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it switches the yarn so as you guys

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
it switches the yarn so as you guys
recall<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.590> probably<00:00:31.980> remember<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> did

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
recall you probably remember that I did

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
recall you probably remember that I did
not<00:00:33.270> use<00:00:33.329> cork<00:00:33.899> under<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.440> flexed<00:00:35.160> track<00:00:35.430> in

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
not use cork under my flexed track in

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.450 
not use cork under my flexed track in
the<00:00:36.090> video<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.380> assure<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.280> was

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the video and I assure you that it was

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760 
the video and I assure you that it was
not<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> mistake<00:00:38.940> however<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.620> guys

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
not a mistake however a lot of you guys

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
not a mistake however a lot of you guys
left<00:00:41.100> comments<00:00:41.430> asking<00:00:42.059> why<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> didn't<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
left comments asking why I didn't and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.590 
left comments asking why I didn't and
I'm<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> explain<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.730> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I'm going to explain that right now we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
I'm going to explain that right now we
didn't<00:00:45.840> use<00:00:45.960> cork<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> layout<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
didn't use cork on the layout because it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
didn't use cork on the layout because it
bumped<00:00:47.670> track<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> an<00:00:48.360> unrealistic<00:00:48.840> height

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
bumped track up to an unrealistic height

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
bumped track up to an unrealistic height
if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> look<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> prototype<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
if you look at the prototype in and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.119 
if you look at the prototype in and
around<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> live<00:00:52.289> you'll<00:00:52.770> notice<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
around where you live you'll notice that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
around where you live you'll notice that
yards<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.910> industrial<00:00:54.480> Spurs<00:00:54.750> aren't<00:00:55.230> built

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
yards and industrial Spurs aren't built

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610 
yards and industrial Spurs aren't built
as<00:00:55.620> high<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:56.100> main<00:00:56.430> lines<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.500> since<00:00:58.500> our

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
as high as main lines and since our

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
as high as main lines and since our
layout<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.160> industrial<00:00:59.460> switching<00:01:00.120> layout

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
layout is an industrial switching layout

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.740 
layout is an industrial switching layout
we<00:01:00.780> decided<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> use<00:01:01.649> cork<00:01:02.210> by<00:01:03.210> doing<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we decided not to use cork by doing this

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
we decided not to use cork by doing this
we<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.080> able<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.559> keep<00:01:04.739> our<00:01:04.920> track<00:01:05.189> low<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
we were able to keep our track low to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
we were able to keep our track low to
the<00:01:05.670> ground<00:01:05.760> thus<00:01:06.630> similar<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> prototype

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the ground thus similar to the prototype

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.929 
the ground thus similar to the prototype
in<00:01:08.159> America<00:01:09.740> however<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:11.400> people<00:01:11.549> would

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in America however some people would

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.240 
in America however some people would
argue<00:01:11.970> though<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> cork<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.590> still<00:01:13.799> good<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
argue though that cork is still good and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850 
argue though that cork is still good and
I<00:01:14.340> agree<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:15.020> cork<00:01:16.020> traditionally<00:01:16.680> has

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I agree with them cork traditionally has

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
I agree with them cork traditionally has
been<00:01:16.890> used<00:01:17.310> though<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.299> absorbs<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
been used though because it absorbs the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
been used though because it absorbs the
vibrations<00:01:19.530> caused<00:01:19.799> by<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> train<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
vibrations caused by the train on the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.300 
vibrations caused by the train on the
track<00:01:20.909> thus<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.930> reduces<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.950> amount<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
track thus it reduces the amount of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
track thus it reduces the amount of
noise<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> Train<00:01:24.210> makes<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.780> goes

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
noise that the Train makes when it goes

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.230 
noise that the Train makes when it goes
over<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.320> switch<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:29.040> reality<00:01:29.520> guys<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
over a switch in reality guys is there a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.840 
over a switch in reality guys is there a
yes<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.750> no<00:01:30.930> rule<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.320> says<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.610> or

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
yes or no rule that says you have to or

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.929 
yes or no rule that says you have to or
don't<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> use<00:01:34.020> cork<00:01:34.350> bed<00:01:34.560> no<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.610> comes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
don't have to use cork bed no it comes

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.240 
don't have to use cork bed no it comes
down<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> personal<00:01:36.450> preference<00:01:37.100> what<00:01:38.100> I'd

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
down to personal preference what I'd

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.530 
down to personal preference what I'd
recommend<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> people<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> are

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
recommend with the people that are

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
recommend with the people that are
asking<00:01:39.930> me<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> use<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
asking me if they need to use it on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
asking me if they need to use it on
their<00:01:41.250> ladder<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.820> look<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.659> some

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
their ladder or not look at some

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.270 
their ladder or not look at some
prototype<00:01:43.409> pictures<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.979> where<00:01:44.159> you're

modeling

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490

see<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.270> high<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> main<00:01:45.810> line<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> then

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
see how high the main line is and then
