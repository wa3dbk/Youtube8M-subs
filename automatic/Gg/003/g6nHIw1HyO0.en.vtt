00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.509
 to the next player review today is 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.890
 times for chinese couple ever lu sc wants 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.240
 the good old frenchman 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 I forgot the team 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 That's why we see everyone 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 screenshot from yes before ted if you guys 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.480
 want to look at the topic just once 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.250
 click on a pose then you can 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.859
 look at you there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.930
 we come directly to the in gamestage 25 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 years old is the Frenchman 175 7 70 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.710
 kilogram heavy can be left and right 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.740
 play high medium working rate and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.099
 researcher skills and weed 89 starts 993 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.309
 agility 8 after 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.450
 Reaction speed are the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.489
 main sets in the physical 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.899
 Attributes 51 degrees and small 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.790
 but runaway is not that bad 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 his mental attributes are the same as we are 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.750
 just to see are complete 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 for the dax you can not do anything with it 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.739
 beginning 60 secured survey is 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.820
 okay but two aggression is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 easy for a ass do not need 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.620
 incapable of any eighth figure than 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.649
 control 85 89 dribbling 780 completion 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.670
 91 precision 96 shots 88 penalty meters 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.600
 91 short from 90 shot power and 91 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.549
 because there are the kiesbett say yes 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 Often not so much about a player 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.760
 as you might think 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.710
 and that's why he can ask 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 in game confirm what his stats 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.520
 demonstrate 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.619
 no, so it can partially 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 again not ag is a very good one 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.500
 player his salary in the form is right 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 really good it does not cost much 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.150
 about 150 kuwait box and that's yes 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.280
 on the second day only as the first 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.189
 day after it comes out so it costs 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 almost nothing but how can you 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.600
 say that it is worth it and how it plays 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.670
 he himself he is pretty fast 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.020
 86 tempo that's definitely in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.070
 order for left wing play that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 is not outstanding 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.479
 and it really does not matter 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.060
 faster at 186 he has a good pace 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.220
 but it is not young and no word that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.979
 you just have to take into account as in 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 By the way, 89 became 86 total 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.009
 bullshit but can happen 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.020
 he feels fast but is always 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.509
 still no record and so calendar that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 fits in any case and is ok 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.290
 but he's nobody 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 really where you really say okay that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.240
 pension, for example , becomes and leaves everyone 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.009
 opponent 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
 his dribbling is very good very precise 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.000
 leads the ball very well on the foot and will 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.830
 rarely separated because he too 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 a constant strength will be very good 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.819
 the value of the balance is very good 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.590
 very nice the problem with him is such a 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.330
 he can do a bit of the header 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.410
 fitting is alright but being 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.810
 Shot is such a thing 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.030
 partly good partly absolute hell 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 that is not normal anymore so you see 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.569
 her some clips where he really behaves 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.040
 where he really has good chances for her 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.120
 For example , you just had to go with links 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.099
 just clean it but he shoots 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.459
 goalkeeper and that happens to be so often 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.170
 Graduation is never 87 that you can 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.400
 Just do not tell anyone because it's so good 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.290
 he does not make a conclusion he makes many goals 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 you have to be honest but be 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 graduation 780 first left 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.959
 wing players then you do not shoot like that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 many gates but in spite of all that already 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.590
 It's not 780 because it's easy 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.360
 leaves far too many opportunities and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.620
 this is extremely noticeable on his free kicks 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.519
 want to see here now are very 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.690
 good, unfortunately I have no with him 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.040
 but still it was on everyone 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.380
 case ok his corners are too 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.450
 very nice 99 body you will not all 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 his fans are easy for n ass may 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.390
 you do not even deal with it as well 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.830
 with his long shot i have a long 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.799
 shot hit a single here 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.450
 determined 25 tries the lips me and 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.459
 they fly mostly right at the gate 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.829
 This is really really smooth 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.750
 everything with long shaker and I believe 96 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.880
 or 91 long shot I just do not know 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.940
 exactly what you expect is that he 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.709
 pulls much better on goal as well 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.030
 somehow in the clouds have klipp 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.200
 unfortunately not with taken but that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.010
 will you seen frankly 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.109
 I am completely honest 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.060
 but he is still a good player 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.320
 is to be fast actually Committee strongly 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.819
 reflex in order and he can also in 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.290
 emergency minds will definitely work 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.319
 clear to the forest as it is in the report 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.900
 easy to link runs in any case 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.920
 We'll come to the conclusion with the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.230
 whole videos 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.910
 Getting the clips and again 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.190
 nice shot here but kept 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.530
 so we come to the positive and 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.480
 negative things and where you can 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.880
 although we are pretty critical 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.160
 was outweighed clearly the positive 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.840
 Let's get him agile very quickly 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.489
 and thus difficult to separate from the ball 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.900
 simply because he has precise drilling 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.160
 So the first three points can be 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 wonderful to sum up 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.799
 He has very good flanks with both 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.790
 I do not have any feet at all 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.049
 but I think you have that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.280
 seen a clip if even more 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.860
 was his flanks are 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.630
 very very good fit 780 it shows 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.550
 thereby a good position play has 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.109
 even as he is often always right 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.820
 on the right position on the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.470
 now and then he poses to his left wing 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.989
 times in storm no idea why but 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.380
 then only if it really is 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.120
 important and good 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.440
 So the high shot power also runs 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.790
 is still a positive point sometimes 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.320
 a little too high, we come 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.090
 just too easy to link 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.770
 Frenchman of the French league is 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.510
 did not know her very dearly for that 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.580
 he lets them do it instead of 89 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.220
 already six nations 780 fit and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.080
 for only 140 150k that's almost 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.330
 not stars before it's all about forster 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.860
 This is definitely ok 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.360
 good standard also has the free kick 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.740
 He can also see and corner very much 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.120
 Well 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.860
 hat occasionally misfire during graduation 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.419
 that the first negative aspect so he 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.880
 has really given many chances because 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.050
 it's a bit too bad that's it 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.850
 really what has not annoying 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.310
 long chance unconvincing times even 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.560
 not the never in life has 690 long shot 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.970
 maybe 80 or so what is improving 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.530
 not introduced as I said only 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.720
 my opinion but with me has easy 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.160
 not convinced that a nest despite 95 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.240
 Do not just not behave right 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.620
 Great is still very nicely described 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.540
 So very fine already is actually 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.290
 perfect for the cartons 16 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.280
 tries to shoot 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.900
 which is also good for the long short 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.030
 and he has what I have 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.760
 just did not mention horrible 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.200
 eleven meter is so bad 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.970
 eleven meters I have two with him 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.100
 shot and he shot off 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.450
 although they were perfect shot of 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.880
 I'm honest they were perfect 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.530
 still shot absolutely 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.660
 shot once against post 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.210
 and once that's over at the gate so 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.940
 somehow are therefore definitely not 88 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.770
 you can definitely set it that way 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.810
 we come to the rating I give it despite 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.580
 its negative aspects 8.7 out of ten 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.440
 the more points she earns quickly 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.210
 only actually start shooting good 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.250
 flank precise dribbling sensible 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.810
 header and especially from the left 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.390
 midfield position he might with hey 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.910
 medium margret much better suited 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.380
 be as, for example, grießmann or 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.430
 any left wing players that 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.780
 Majority just from france I can 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.120
 a field and who is not a ribéry 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.870
 then can you bring me carré 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.410
 I hope I do not speak at all 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.150
 right and yes that was mine 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.590
 controller but that does not matter 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.890
 Of course he gets one anyway 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.419
 thumbs up he is clearly he was one 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.620
 good player he has fun with him 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.479
 play and he is definitely 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.099
 Recommended for the left side in 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.390
 a french team on men im 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.400
 moment 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.800
 grissmann in shape is also here 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.170
 I liked the music again 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.550
 have again from velux music and yes me 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.050
 I want to be happy with the evaluation or 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.100
 a commentary both we can 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.810
 like to write the comments again 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.220
 want to see next and we see 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.120
 The next time we bit again 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.120
 Take care
