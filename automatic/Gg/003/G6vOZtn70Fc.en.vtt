there<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.500> close<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.490> Dave<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
there and that close up that Dave just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.999 
there and that close up that Dave just
took<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> drainage<00:01:31.110> base<00:01:31.350> plate<00:01:31.740> that's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
took was the drainage base plate that's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
took was the drainage base plate that's
sort<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.579> enhancement<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.540> unit<00:01:33.930> okay

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
sort of an enhancement to this unit okay

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.120 
sort of an enhancement to this unit okay
that<00:01:34.920> allows<00:01:35.460> us<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.509> separate<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> liquids

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that allows us to separate the liquids

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
that allows us to separate the liquids
from<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> active<00:01:39.710> colony<00:01:40.710> okay<00:01:41.400> better<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
from the active colony okay better so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.539 
from the active colony okay better so
getting<00:01:43.350> rid<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> liquids<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.310> only

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
getting rid of the liquids not only

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.420 
getting rid of the liquids not only
addresses<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.409> aerobic<00:01:46.409> versus<00:01:46.770> anaerobic

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
addresses the aerobic versus anaerobic

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.749 
addresses the aerobic versus anaerobic
issue<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> addresses<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:49.170> odor<00:01:49.470> issue<00:01:49.759> now

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
issue but it addresses an odor issue now

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
issue but it addresses an odor issue now
we<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> entire<00:01:51.360> base<00:01:51.630> plate<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
we have the entire base plate is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.899 
we have the entire base plate is
perforated<00:01:52.590> okay<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.159> many<00:01:53.430> ports<00:01:53.790> if

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
perforated okay there are many ports if

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
perforated okay there are many ports if
one<00:01:54.060> clogs<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:55.020> worry<00:01:55.290> sure<00:01:55.649> another
