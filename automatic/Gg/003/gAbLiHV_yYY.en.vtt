00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
the Enigma Variations of Elgar have

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.020 
the Enigma Variations of Elgar have
posed<00:00:10.930> a<00:00:11.139> question<00:00:11.290> for<00:00:11.830> scholars<00:00:12.309> and<00:00:12.340> music

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
posed a question for scholars and music

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.720 
posed a question for scholars and music
lovers<00:00:13.629> for<00:00:14.289> the<00:00:14.379> last<00:00:14.590> century<00:00:15.129> and<00:00:15.370> that<00:00:15.520> is

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
lovers for the last century and that is

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.480 
lovers for the last century and that is
what<00:00:16.150> is<00:00:16.390> the<00:00:16.600> exact<00:00:17.020> meaning<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:17.710> what<00:00:18.280> is

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
what is the exact meaning and what is

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.300 
what is the exact meaning and what is
the<00:00:18.670> enigma<00:00:19.210> well<00:00:20.050> some<00:00:20.410> people<00:00:20.590> think<00:00:20.800> it<00:00:21.280> was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
the enigma well some people think it was

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.650 
the enigma well some people think it was
auld<00:00:21.850> lang<00:00:22.300> syne<00:00:22.330> in<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.670> minor<00:00:24.940> key<00:00:25.360> that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
auld lang syne in the minor key that

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.200 
auld lang syne in the minor key that
runs<00:00:25.900> against<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.530> theme<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:27.700> inaudible

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
runs against the theme that is inaudible

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.290 
runs against the theme that is inaudible
and<00:00:28.840> other<00:00:29.200> people<00:00:29.710> wonder<00:00:30.250> if<00:00:30.490> it's<00:00:30.700> not<00:00:30.940> just

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
and other people wonder if it's not just

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.529 
and other people wonder if it's not just
the<00:00:31.540> fact<00:00:31.840> that<00:00:32.219> Elgar<00:00:33.270> synthesized<00:00:34.270> music

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
the fact that Elgar synthesized music

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.140 
the fact that Elgar synthesized music
and<00:00:35.170> styles<00:00:35.829> from<00:00:35.890> Tchaikovsky<00:00:36.700> from

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
and styles from Tchaikovsky from

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.720 
and styles from Tchaikovsky from
Schumann<00:00:38.020> from<00:00:39.510> vogner<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.780> Bartok<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.800> sort

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
Schumann from vogner and Bartok and sort

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.940 
Schumann from vogner and Bartok and sort
of<00:00:42.910> made<00:00:43.180> his<00:00:43.450> own<00:00:43.630> language<00:00:43.930> here<00:00:44.530> that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
of made his own language here that

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.890 
of made his own language here that
doesn't<00:00:45.489> really<00:00:45.670> sound<00:00:45.940> like<00:00:46.120> any<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.720> them

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
doesn't really sound like any of them

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.920 
doesn't really sound like any of them
but<00:00:47.110> has<00:00:47.350> elements<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.310> all<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.700> them<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:49.690> main

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
but has elements of all of them the main

00:00:49.930 --> 00:01:06.300 
but has elements of all of them the main
theme<00:00:50.350> as<00:00:50.620> you<00:00:50.950> know<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.370> very

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.800 

and<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:08.149> you<00:01:08.390> take<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:10.490> Auld<00:01:10.609> Lang<00:01:10.759> Syne<00:01:10.969> seem

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
and if you take the Auld Lang Syne seem

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.330 
and if you take the Auld Lang Syne seem
in<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.289> minor

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.700 

and<00:01:19.820> put<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.240> against<00:01:20.690> that<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.260> get

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
and put it against that you get

00:01:21.710 --> 00:02:19.500 
and put it against that you get
something<00:01:21.979> like<00:01:22.280> this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.290 

and<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.350> great<00:02:21.620> variation<00:02:22.460> Nimrod<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
and so is the great variation Nimrod the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.590 
and so is the great variation Nimrod the
variation<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:23.930> Elgar<00:02:24.530> wrote<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.700> actually

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
variation that Elgar wrote to actually

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.040 
variation that Elgar wrote to actually
try<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.410> recreate<00:02:28.030> Beethoven<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.240> his<00:02:29.810> own

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
try and recreate Beethoven in his own

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.070 
try and recreate Beethoven in his own
image<00:02:30.320> he<00:02:31.130> had<00:02:31.460> spoken<00:02:32.000> often<00:02:32.270> about<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.840> fact

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
image he had spoken often about the fact

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.230 
image he had spoken often about the fact

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
in every country and it has a unique

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.280 
in every country and it has a unique
sound<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.640> due<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.270> fact<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
sound to it due to the fact that the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.920 
sound to it due to the fact that the
music<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.770> so<00:03:15.950> concentrated<00:03:16.940> in<00:03:17.420> other<00:03:17.690> words

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
music is so concentrated in other words

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.960 
music is so concentrated in other words
the<00:03:18.140> variations<00:03:18.740> are<00:03:18.860> short<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:19.640> they're<00:03:19.850> all

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
the variations are short but they're all

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.360 
the variations are short but they're all
linked<00:03:20.420> together<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.260> all<00:03:21.440> part<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.890> a

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
linked together so it's all part of a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.040 
linked together so it's all part of a
larger<00:03:22.820> picture<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.810> makes<00:03:24.140> this<00:03:26.020> really<00:03:27.020> a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
larger picture that makes this really a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.320 
larger picture that makes this really a
very<00:03:27.350> special<00:03:27.620> work<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.430> every<00:03:28.850> way

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
very special work in every way

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.840 
very special work in every way
what<00:03:29.810> makes<00:03:30.080> Elgar<00:03:30.590> different<00:03:31.130> than<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
what makes Elgar different than the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.630 
what makes Elgar different than the
composers<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.690> models<00:03:33.080> he<00:03:33.260> used<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.770> probably

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
composers the models he used is probably

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.240 
composers the models he used is probably
the<00:03:34.910> fusion<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.810> Elgar<00:03:36.350> used<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.920> his<00:03:37.100> own

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
the fusion that Elgar used in his own

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.820 
the fusion that Elgar used in his own
music<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:38.210> of<00:03:38.420> British<00:03:38.840> band<00:03:39.200> music

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
music that of British band music

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.030 
music that of British band music
compared<00:03:40.310> with<00:03:40.870> serious<00:03:41.870> Symphony<00:03:42.440> Orchestra

get rid of it and that's one of the neat
things<00:04:08.120> about<00:04:08.300> today<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.620> have<00:04:09.860> this<00:04:10.490> fusion

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
things about today to have this fusion

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.780 
things about today to have this fusion
between<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.740> sounds<00:04:12.740> of<00:04:12.860> basically<00:04:13.670> a
