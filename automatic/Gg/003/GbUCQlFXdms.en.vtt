what you want to delete with your mouse

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.530 
what you want to delete with your mouse
first<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.340> color<00:01:38.700> grading

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
first over here we have color grading

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.609 
first over here we have color grading
tools<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.880> from<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.299> tell<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.350> are

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
tools and from what I can tell these are

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
tools and from what I can tell these are
really<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.899> shortcut<00:01:45.899> keys<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
really just shortcut keys to get to the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.179 
really just shortcut keys to get to the
tools<00:01:48.439> because<00:01:49.439> you've<00:01:49.619> got<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.920> ahead<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
tools because you've got to go ahead and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.690 
tools because you've got to go ahead and
move<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.549> cursor<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.689> actual<00:01:52.590> clip<00:01:53.430> that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
move your cursor to the actual clip that

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.910 
move your cursor to the actual clip that
you<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> tools<00:01:55.259> will<00:01:55.560> pop<00:01:55.890> up

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you want and then the tools will pop up

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670 
you want and then the tools will pop up
but<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.610> could<00:01:56.909> find<00:01:57.149> no<00:01:57.420> way<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> adjust<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
but I could find no way to adjust the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
but I could find no way to adjust the
color<00:01:59.009> from<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> iPad

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
color from the iPad

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.390 
color from the iPad
so<00:02:01.689> I'm<00:02:01.869> assuming<00:02:02.020> they're<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.770> shortcut

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
so I'm assuming they're just shortcut

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.050 
so I'm assuming they're just shortcut
keys<00:02:03.790> there<00:02:04.570> are<00:02:04.750> some<00:02:05.189> autocorrect<00:02:06.189> buttons

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
keys there are some autocorrect buttons

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.740 
keys there are some autocorrect buttons
to<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.450> right<00:02:07.800> for<00:02:08.800> white<00:02:09.160> balance<00:02:09.750> home

zoom<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.580> out<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.750> good<00:02:16.930> shortcut<00:02:17.590> key

the<00:02:48.940> point<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.200> maybe<00:02:50.950> I'm<00:02:51.220> missing

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
the point of it and maybe I'm missing

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.180 
the point of it and maybe I'm missing
some<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.360> functionality<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.500> someone

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
some of the functionality if someone

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.610 
some of the functionality if someone
wants<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.030> leave<00:02:55.269> me<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> comment<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.319> tell<00:02:56.410> me

that I'm using it all wrong then please
do<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.819> don't<00:03:01.299> see<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.049> point<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.650> having<00:03:03.580> my

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
do so I don't see the point in having my

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.920 
do so I don't see the point in having my
trackpad<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:05.019> Mouse<00:03:05.500> my<00:03:06.400> keyboard<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.269> then

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
an iPad as well to control Final Cut Pro

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.400 
an iPad as well to control Final Cut Pro
I<00:03:11.799> haven't<00:03:12.760> used<00:03:12.970> Final<00:03:13.420> Cut<00:03:13.600> Pro<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:14.140> long

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
I haven't used Final Cut Pro that long

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.190 
I haven't used Final Cut Pro that long
but<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:15.340> not<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.820> difficult<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.390> use<00:03:16.750> I've

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
but it's not that difficult to use I've

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.650 
but it's not that difficult to use I've
learned<00:03:17.530> most<00:03:17.859> of<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> shortcuts<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.120> I'm

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
learned most of the shortcuts and I'm

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.539 
learned most of the shortcuts and I'm
quite<00:03:20.380> proficient<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.370> using<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.810> trackpad

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
quite proficient in using the trackpad

with<00:03:24.549> Final<00:03:24.970> Cut<00:03:25.120> Pro<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.630> don't<00:03:25.959> see<00:03:26.320> why<00:03:26.590> I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
with Final Cut Pro I don't see why I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.000 
with Final Cut Pro I don't see why I
need<00:03:26.910> another<00:03:27.910> device<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:29.320> operate<00:03:29.829> my

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
need another device to operate my

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.900 
need another device to operate my
computer<00:03:31.709> now<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.280> just<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.730> first

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
computer now this is just the first

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.690 
computer now this is just the first
release<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.989> maybe<00:03:35.410> they'll<00:03:35.709> add<00:03:35.920> more<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.670> it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
release so maybe they'll add more to it

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.259 
release so maybe they'll add more to it
as<00:03:37.090> time<00:03:37.570> goes<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.109> but<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:39.489> don't<00:03:39.880> recommend

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
as time goes on but I don't recommend

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.660 
as time goes on but I don't recommend
spending<00:03:41.190> $25<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.660> save<00:03:43.660> your<00:03:43.980> $25<00:03:44.980> wait

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
spending $25 on this save your $25 wait

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.599 
spending $25 on this save your $25 wait
for<00:03:45.970> them<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.120> update<00:03:46.739> now<00:03:47.739> eventually<00:03:48.130> if<00:03:48.459> I

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
for them to update now eventually if I

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.090 
for them to update now eventually if I
could<00:03:48.850> lean<00:03:49.120> back<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.690> my<00:03:49.840> chair<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.170> use<00:03:50.890> my

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
could lean back in my chair and use my

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.780 
could lean back in my chair and use my
iPad

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
iPad

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.990 
iPad
did<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.799> reach<00:03:53.799> over<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.519> move<00:03:54.819> the
