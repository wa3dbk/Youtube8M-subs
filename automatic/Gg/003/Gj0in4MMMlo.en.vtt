advanced expert skiers especially those
that<00:00:12.990> want<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> benefits<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.459> the<00:00:14.639> FKS

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that want all the benefits of the FKS

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.750 
that want all the benefits of the FKS
system<00:00:15.539> and<00:00:16.080> don't<00:00:16.350> quite<00:00:16.560> need<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.890> 8:18

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
system and don't quite need that 8:18

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.470 
system and don't quite need that 8:18
dense<00:00:18.150> setting<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.890> FKS<00:00:20.519> 180<00:00:20.970> so

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
dense setting that is on the FKS 180 so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.070 
dense setting that is on the FKS 180 so
if<00:00:21.599> the<00:00:21.720> FPS<00:00:21.900> 140<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.400> get<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> 5<00:00:23.849> to<00:00:24.119> 14<00:00:24.599> Vince<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
if the FPS 140 you get a 5 to 14 Vince I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.589 
if the FPS 140 you get a 5 to 14 Vince I
think<00:00:25.109> definitely<00:00:25.650> still<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.460> dinner<00:00:27.359> range

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
think definitely still a dinner range

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.079 
think definitely still a dinner range
that's<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:29.220> starting<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> 5<00:00:29.880> it's

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
that's up there but starting at a 5 it's

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.120 
that's up there but starting at a 5 it's
gonna<00:00:30.179> fit<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> wider<00:00:30.900> range<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.380> skiers<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
gonna fit a wider range of skiers you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.860 
gonna fit a wider range of skiers you
also<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.490> slightly<00:00:32.790> lighter<00:00:33.210> package<00:00:33.690> with

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
also get a slightly lighter package with

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.900 
also get a slightly lighter package with
the<00:00:34.020> ski<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.470> with<00:00:34.830> a<00:00:34.860> full<00:00:35.100> composite<00:00:35.580> toe<00:00:36.170> um

just<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.240> 180<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.810> FKS<00:00:40.230> 140<00:00:41.130> has<00:00:41.310> seven

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
just like the 180 the FKS 140 has seven

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400 
just like the 180 the FKS 140 has seven

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
transmission energy to your ski

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.420 
transmission energy to your ski
throughout<00:00:48.060> you<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.200> dual<00:00:49.770> action<00:00:49.950> toe

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
throughout you have the dual action toe

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
throughout you have the dual action toe
here<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.840> dual<00:00:51.990> action<00:00:52.230> toe<00:00:52.560> provides

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
here and this dual action toe provides

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.190 
here and this dual action toe provides
you<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.880> lateral<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:54.660> vertical<00:00:56.060> release

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
you with lateral and vertical release

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.470 
you with lateral and vertical release
with<00:00:58.200> 45<00:00:58.650> millimetres<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> lateral<00:01:00.090> release

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
with 45 millimetres of lateral release

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.110 
with 45 millimetres of lateral release
so<00:01:00.780> great<00:01:01.740> extension<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.580> you're<00:01:02.940> not

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so great extension there you're not

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
so great extension there you're not
going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.330> pre<00:01:03.660> release<00:01:04.129> release<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> then

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
going to pre release release and then

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.569 
going to pre release release and then
vertically<00:01:05.899> overall<00:01:06.899> just<00:01:07.560> full<00:01:08.039> range<00:01:08.340> there

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
vertically overall just full range there

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.569 
vertically overall just full range there
that's<00:01:08.759> really<00:01:09.030> nice<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:10.109> a<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.649> wide<00:01:10.829> 72

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
that's really nice with a really wide 72

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.660 
that's really nice with a really wide 72
millimeter<00:01:12.630> aft<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.369> great

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
millimeter aft this is going to be great

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
millimeter aft this is going to be great
binding<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.179> out<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.509> powder<00:01:15.689> skis<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
binding them out on your powder skis you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.959 
binding them out on your powder skis you
can<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.469> a<00:01:16.500> little<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:17.369> transmission

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
can get a little more transmission

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.700 
can get a little more transmission
energy<00:01:18.329> from<00:01:18.539> side<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.469> on<00:01:19.560> those

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
energy from side to side there on those

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.880 
energy from side to side there on those
bigger<00:01:20.130> boards<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.780> heel<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.079> this<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
bigger boards and the heel on this just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.789 
bigger boards and the heel on this just
your<00:01:23.039> classic<00:01:23.249> fks<00:01:24.060> heel<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:25.049> 25

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
your classic fks heel with 25

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.700 
your classic fks heel with 25
millimeters<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.640> vertical<00:01:27.240> travel<00:01:27.749> so<00:01:28.229> you're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
millimeters of vertical travel so you're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
millimeters of vertical travel so you're
not<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.039> pre-release<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> heel

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
not going to pre-release on the heel

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
not going to pre-release on the heel
there<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.179> well<00:01:30.649> definitely<00:01:31.649> solid<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.219> with

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
there as well definitely solid and with

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.510 
there as well definitely solid and with
the<00:01:32.460> turntable<00:01:33.060> heel<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:34.039> twisting<00:01:35.039> false

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the turntable heel on twisting false

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
the turntable heel on twisting false
you're<00:01:35.999> gonna<00:01:36.119> release<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.960> smoothly<00:01:37.289> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you're gonna release really smoothly so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.260 
you're gonna release really smoothly so
the<00:01:37.950> toe<00:01:38.130> isn't<00:01:38.429> just<00:01:38.579> gonna<00:01:38.700> release<00:01:38.999> which

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the toe isn't just gonna release which

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
the toe isn't just gonna release which
is<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.539> you<00:01:39.689> could<00:01:39.899> rupture<00:01:40.409> something<00:01:40.859> in

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
is where you could rupture something in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
is where you could rupture something in
your<00:01:41.069> knee<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.369> break<00:01:41.549> something<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.630> heel<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
your knee or break something the heel is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.809 
your knee or break something the heel is
gonna<00:01:43.170> release<00:01:43.499> too<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.159> same<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.609> so

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
gonna release too at the same time so

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.120 
gonna release too at the same time so
it's<00:01:44.969> a<00:01:45.030> very<00:01:45.299> smooth<00:01:45.780> release<00:01:46.109> a<00:01:46.409> lot<00:01:46.829> safer

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it's a very smooth release a lot safer

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.099 
it's a very smooth release a lot safer
and<00:01:47.549> again<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.210> only<00:01:48.329> gonna<00:01:48.539> happen<00:01:48.780> when

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
and again it's only gonna happen when

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.620 
and again it's only gonna happen when
you<00:01:49.229> need<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.579> with<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.609> zero<00:01:50.969> Degree<00:01:51.329> ramp

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you need it with a zero Degree ramp

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.959 
you need it with a zero Degree ramp
angle<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.319> binding<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:52.950> flat<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> the
