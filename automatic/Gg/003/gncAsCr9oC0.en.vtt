just in raw history but in wrestling

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
just in raw history but in wrestling
history<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> end<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> WCW

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
the content and stuff that they're

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.529 
the content and stuff that they're
saying<00:05:43.740> you<00:05:44.340> had<00:05:44.490> Jim<00:05:44.700> Ross<00:05:44.910> come<00:05:45.180> out<00:05:45.330> there
