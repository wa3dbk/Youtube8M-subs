00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.930
 I do not know how to be doing a part and the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 good creative but in this video I'm going to 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.710

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.220
 it would be here but how are they 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.129
 right now there's only there are three 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.640
 done what the creator has said he's going to 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:48.090
 put more but right now there are only 33 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.239
 of these facts well I'm going to a moment 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.239
 I go 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.690
 to pause the video for 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.690
 that we are right now to enter now 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.050
 Well, I 've already swallowed the time 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.410
 He is waiting for you and good would 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.210
 waiting and we would give right click him 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.900
 we would give 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.880
 right click and I'm going with a lot there 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.010
 we would click right and it would take you 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.920
 a room where you are going to wait very 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:28.340
 little and good as I told you is no 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:31.140
 award and 1.7 and 1.8 and good look 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.140
 this is already here, it's worth 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.270
 the thimerosal eyeworks all islets 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.180
 and all good 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.330
 and there are other bridges made 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.770
 because good if not it would be chaos 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.640
 it would be chaos or not 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.130
 OK 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.130
 What I do not know to see is the red team 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.420
 and now what I told you are the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.939
 bridges made and before I've seen one that 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.400
 has complained that this one with three 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.069
 facts but but that kids a lot 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.599
 better because if we would not be all 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.030
 trying to make a bridge and not us 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.930
 would leave much better is at a point it 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.230
 has done is walk think what is not 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:23.580
 I go to the team that I follow and evil 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:27.810
 and good thing is that to me skywork I do not know 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.330
 It's very good but good and upload videos 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.120
 of scribbos and team sky words in this 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.720
 same server 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.849
 and well I hope many likes in this 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.460
 server alone is not premium but 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:47.240
 what happens is that there is only this map 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.199
 but good they will already make more maps 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:55.380
 because as I said they did yesterday 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.720
 yesterday they did not publish it they did it 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.660
 which is that I just watched the video and I've 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.050
 put running to record so that what 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.170
 you know all of us and good to see 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.170
 for me 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.400
 diamonds what happens is that I have 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:18.550
 much side and there are times that it takes me 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.130
 itch peaked and I do not know does not go the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.000
 block so I do not get the diamond but 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.190
 then he waited a while and if he 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.280
 break and give it to me 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.110
 but good to see all this is going very 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.510
 ok before I got into a game of 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.760
 you are all 5 minutes we are all 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:41.100
 full diamond 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.100
 let's see a rose 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.610
 poppies forgive poppies forgive me 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.700
 to see a moment 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.400
 Let's see 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.450
 Well, as you can see, I'm not very good at 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.720
 good games you also see that I am a 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.360
 ghost this is also and it looks like this 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.770
 If I were dead I would not see it if 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.440
 I was not dead I would not see it like that 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:20.630
 indirectly I would not see it but good 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.870
 this would be if you look there are more islands let's go 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.870
 Let's see 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.640
 there are five teams I think I think so 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.380
 45 no 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.470
 44 if you put it to the right if it is 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.840
 I'm very smart myself and well this is 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.110
 the little island of the medium that the truth is that 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.889
 I have not yet entered this edition in 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.810
 the middle one 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:50.250
 well it's all full of chests 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:54.520
 next time I'll try to at least go to 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.400
 medium because it seems to me that in media not 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.780
 there is no bridge but good apart from 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.960
 that are far away will be very difficult 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.910
 because all the teams shooting and 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:09.970
 good and good because nothing this this has 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.620
 been the video of today already here no longer what 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.120
 I will re -enter the password if I do not 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.880
 you see it 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.199
 and well, nothing kids, the only thing 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.830
 I have to tell you 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:23.229

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:27.160
 many people that I'm sure that what 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:31.750
 They will want to see because it is not premium team 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:35.590
 skyworks the first and only server in the 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:40.889
 that there is team star wars and it is not premium and 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.889
 well then nothing until the next goodbye
