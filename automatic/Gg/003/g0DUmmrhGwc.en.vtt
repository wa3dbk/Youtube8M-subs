basin sink now if you've got ceramic
type<00:00:19.109> taps<00:00:19.590> you'll<00:00:19.980> probably<00:00:20.160> find<00:00:20.430> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
type taps you'll probably find that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.490 
type taps you'll probably find that
won't<00:00:20.970> happen<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.600> you've<00:00:21.720> got<00:00:21.750> taps<00:00:22.320> that

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
won't happen but if you've got taps that

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.970 
won't happen but if you've got taps that
are<00:00:23.010> could<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.550> mixer<00:00:23.910> still<00:00:24.289> but<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:25.680> or

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
are could be mixer still but the use or

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.269 
are could be mixer still but the use or
washer<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> times<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:29.010> problem

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
washer then a lot of times the problem

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.600 
washer then a lot of times the problem
could<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.720> actual<00:00:31.109> washer<00:00:31.500> itself<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
could be the actual washer itself so you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
could be the actual washer itself so you
can<00:00:32.969> obviously<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.290> try<00:00:34.500> turning

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
can obviously first of all try turning

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.979 
can obviously first of all try turning
your<00:00:34.980> main<00:00:35.250> stop<00:00:35.579> pressure<00:00:36.059> down<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.570> stop<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
your main stop pressure down to stop it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.110 
your main stop pressure down to stop it
but<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.649> remember<00:00:37.680> they've<00:00:38.219> got<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> too<00:00:38.760> slow

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
but do remember they've got it too slow

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.049 
but do remember they've got it too slow
there<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.989> makes<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.559> very<00:00:40.829> poor<00:00:41.280> fo<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
there it makes it very poor fo for the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.750 
there it makes it very poor fo for the
rest<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.420> taps<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.020> also<00:00:43.489> if<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
rest of the taps and also if you have a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.850 
rest of the taps and also if you have a
roof<00:00:45.000> tank<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.719> slow<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.289> down<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
roof tank that would slow right down and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
roof tank that would slow right down and
you<00:00:46.980> could<00:00:47.219> possibly<00:00:47.579> join<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> tank<00:00:48.649> whilst

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you could possibly join the tank whilst

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
you could possibly join the tank whilst
having<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.100> bath<00:00:50.309> before<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.969> could<00:00:51.090> fill<00:00:51.300> up

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
having a bath before it could fill up

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.979 
having a bath before it could fill up
because<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> pressure<00:00:52.140> could<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.649> low<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
because the pressure could be so low so

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.299 
because the pressure could be so low so
what<00:00:54.989> i'm<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.469> today<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> if

you can see there's our washer there one
our<00:01:45.180> seed<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:46.229> happens<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
our seed now what happens is a lot of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.969 
our seed now what happens is a lot of
times<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.390> washer<00:01:48.840> gets<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.320> very<00:01:49.439> worn

times this washer gets very very worn
and<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:51.180> starts<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> move<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.649> seat

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and it starts to move on that seat

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.359 
and it starts to move on that seat
housing<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> turn<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> tap<00:01:56.159> off

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
housing so that as you turn the tap off

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.880 
housing so that as you turn the tap off
as<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.329> goes<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:57.540> onto<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> seat<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> tap

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
as it goes down onto the seat of the tap

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
as it goes down onto the seat of the tap
it<00:01:59.399> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.820> vibrates<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> pressure

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it kind of vibrates with the pressure

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.499 
it kind of vibrates with the pressure
the<00:02:01.860> pressures<00:02:02.310> high<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:03.000> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.360> make<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the pressures high can kind of make a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.060 
the pressures high can kind of make a
noise<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.200> you've<00:02:04.320> got<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> turn<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.920> off

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
noise so as you've got to turn it off

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190 
noise so as you've got to turn it off
you<00:02:05.579> get<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> squealing<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> hammering

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you get this squealing and hammering

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
you get this squealing and hammering
noise<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.280> washer<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> fine

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
noise as that washer is fine

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.630 
noise as that washer is fine
brain<00:02:09.619> obviously<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> new<00:02:11.130> tab<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
brain obviously this is a new tab and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.340 
brain obviously this is a new tab and
you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.330> obviously<00:02:12.690> not<00:02:12.870> worn<00:02:13.200> at

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you can see it's obviously not worn at

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.710 
you can see it's obviously not worn at
all<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.610> can't<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.150> replace<00:02:15.420> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
all so now you can't just replace that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.830 
all so now you can't just replace that
washer<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.430> probably<00:02:17.880> will<00:02:18.180> stop<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.690> but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
washer and you probably will stop it but

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
washer and you probably will stop it but
if<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.050> want<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> make<00:02:19.380> certain<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.160> stop<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
if you want to make certain to stop it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.090 
if you want to make certain to stop it
then<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.480> answer<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.320> take<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.740> washer

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
then the answer is to take that washer

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.370 
then the answer is to take that washer
off<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.370> fit<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.790> these<00:02:24.030> washers<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:25.320> is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
off of fit one of these washers this is

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.010 
off of fit one of these washers this is
what<00:02:25.710> we<00:02:25.860> call<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> dome<00:02:26.520> tap<00:02:26.970> washer<00:02:27.390> now

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
what we call a dome tap washer now

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.320 
what we call a dome tap washer now
that's<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> end<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.310> bath<00:02:29.970> tap

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that's on the end and this is a bath tap

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.060 
that's on the end and this is a bath tap
one<00:02:30.570> I'm<00:02:30.660> sorry<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.140> haven't<00:02:31.320> got<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> 50ml

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
one I'm sorry so I haven't got a 50ml

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.190 
one I'm sorry so I haven't got a 50ml
one<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.400> show<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.690> replace<00:02:34.020> with

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
one to show you but if you replace with

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.250 
one to show you but if you replace with
one<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.500> those<00:02:34.680> as<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:36.090> goes<00:02:36.330> into<00:02:36.570> C<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.140> will

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
one of those as that goes into C it will

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560 
one of those as that goes into C it will
gradually<00:02:37.650> come<00:02:38.220> across<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.700> seat<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.150> so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
gradually come across the seat like so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.650 
gradually come across the seat like so
and<00:02:40.340> because<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.580> action<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.240> kind<00:02:42.570> of

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
and because of that action it kind of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.660 
and because of that action it kind of
stops<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.290> water<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.650> monoids<00:02:44.040> from<00:02:44.220> happening

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
stops the water a monoids from happening

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.970 
stops the water a monoids from happening
because<00:02:45.240> it<00:02:45.450> gradually<00:02:45.930> goes<00:02:46.230> into<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> sea

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
because it gradually goes into the sea

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.130 
because it gradually goes into the sea
and<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.820> allowed<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.270> vibrate<00:02:48.780> up<00:02:48.810> and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
and it's not allowed to vibrate up and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.860 
and it's not allowed to vibrate up and
down<00:02:49.320> like<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.910> stops<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.450> hammer

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
down like so and that stops that hammer

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.979 
down like so and that stops that hammer
noise<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.940> my<00:02:54.090> recommendation<00:02:54.390> if

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
noise so this is my recommendation if

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.630 
noise so this is my recommendation if
you've<00:02:55.110> got<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> tap<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.739> he's<00:02:56.100> making<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
you've got a tap that he's making a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.570 
you've got a tap that he's making a
noise<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:57.120> 110<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:58.440> yourself<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.890> dome<00:02:59.190> tap

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
noise just 110 get yourself a dome tap

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.190 
noise just 110 get yourself a dome tap
washer<00:02:59.970> from<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.270> plumbers<00:03:00.600> merchants<00:03:01.020> or

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
washer from your plumbers merchants or

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.610 
washer from your plumbers merchants or
shop<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.800> get<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.160> that's<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.640> bath<00:03:02.850> tap<00:03:03.150> one

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
shop you get that that's a bath tap one

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.770 
shop you get that that's a bath tap one
obviously<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.860> sink<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.850> size<00:03:06.150> now

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
obviously the sink one is that size now

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.650 
obviously the sink one is that size now
on<00:03:07.050> some<00:03:07.350> taps<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> recessed<00:03:09.030> housing

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
on some taps you have a recessed housing

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.479 
on some taps you have a recessed housing
for<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.020> washer<00:03:10.230> de'cine<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.340> will

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
for the washer de'cine then you will

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.850 
for the washer de'cine then you will
have<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.730> file<00:03:12.030> around<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> outside<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.709> that

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
have to file around the outside of that

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.979 
have to file around the outside of that
to<00:03:14.100> get<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.549> fit<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.970> can<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.690> bit<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
to get it to fit in can be a bit of a

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.110 
to get it to fit in can be a bit of a
problem<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.470> sometimes<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.430> nut<00:03:17.670> won't<00:03:17.970> go

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
problem and sometimes a nut won't go

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720 
problem and sometimes a nut won't go
back<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.780> end<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.260> because<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.310> it's

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
back on the end and because it's it's

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.670 
back on the end and because it's it's
not<00:03:20.820> good<00:03:21.090> enough<00:03:21.330> thread<00:03:21.660> left<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.470> they're

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
not good enough thread left so they're

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.530 
not good enough thread left so they're
the<00:03:22.860> little<00:03:23.220> problems<00:03:23.640> associated<00:03:24.030> with

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the little problems associated with

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.320 
the little problems associated with
fitting<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.019> dome<00:03:25.260> washer<00:03:25.820> but<00:03:26.820> at<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> end<00:03:27.209> of

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
fitting a dome washer but at the end of

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.110 
fitting a dome washer but at the end of
day<00:03:27.510> once<00:03:28.200> you've<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.560> one<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.880> will

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
day once you've got one on there it will

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.390 
day once you've got one on there it will
