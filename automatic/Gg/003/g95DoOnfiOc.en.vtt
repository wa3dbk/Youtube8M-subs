00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
actually goes for protect to see what's

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.480 
actually goes for protect to see what's
going<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.740> see<00:02:39.860> what<00:02:39.980> kind<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.190> imprinted

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
going on to see what kind of imprinted

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.220 
going on to see what kind of imprinted
we<00:02:41.090> realized<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.960> friend<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
we realized that this is a friend I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.110 
we realized that this is a friend I
can't<00:02:42.440> really<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.650> anything<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.130> actually<00:02:44.090> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
can't really do anything so actually I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.370 
can't really do anything so actually I
think<00:02:44.150> they're<00:02:44.420> pretty<00:02:44.570> clear<00:02:44.840> don't<00:02:45.020> walk<00:02:45.200> to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
think they're pretty clear don't walk to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.660 
think they're pretty clear don't walk to
this<00:02:45.500> guy<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.710> don't<00:02:45.770> think<00:02:46.040> he<00:02:46.100> has<00:02:46.280> her<00:02:46.430> but

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
this guy I don't think he has her but

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.660 
this guy I don't think he has her but
maybe<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.060> flare<00:02:47.390> blitz<00:02:47.570> or<00:02:47.720> something

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
maybe like a flare blitz or something

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.910 
maybe like a flare blitz or something
okay<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:49.730> he<00:02:50.000> protects<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.810> we<00:02:51.500> go<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.740> our

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
okay so he protects and we go to our

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.250 
okay so he protects and we go to our
shows<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.490> Dora<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.180> he<00:02:53.600> keeps<00:02:53.750> protecting

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
shows on Dora and he keeps protecting

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.330 
shows on Dora and he keeps protecting
which<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.470> really<00:02:54.650> smart<00:02:54.920> because<00:02:55.100> he<00:02:55.190> gets

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
which is really smart because he gets

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.740 
which is really smart because he gets
leftovers<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.000> he<00:02:56.090> gets<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.300> see<00:02:56.540> what<00:02:56.630> we're

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
leftovers and he gets to see what we're

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.350 
leftovers and he gets to see what we're
doing<00:02:56.870> anything<00:02:57.860> here's<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.880> Jake<00:02:59.060> Amir's

blocky look at that thing I could set up

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.600 
blocky look at that thing I could set up
on<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.550> thing<00:03:16.610> like<00:03:17.330> unless<00:03:17.660> he<00:03:17.720> has<00:03:18.050> like

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
on this thing like unless he has like

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.850 
on this thing like unless he has like
I'll<00:03:19.610> be<00:03:19.880> has<00:03:20.120> any<00:03:20.360> moves<00:03:20.630> Hingis<00:03:21.410> has<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> bunch
