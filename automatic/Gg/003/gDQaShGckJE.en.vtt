troubles trying to push it a bit a
little<00:02:26.550> bit<00:02:26.670> harder<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.530> repeat<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
little bit harder and repeat with the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.090 
little bit harder and repeat with the
second<00:02:29.190> RAM<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.240> top<00:02:30.480> slot<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.380> it's

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
second RAM on the the top slot and it's

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.760 
second RAM on the the top slot and it's
achieved<00:02:32.520> very<00:02:32.730> very<00:02:33.120> simple<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.780> believed

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
achieved very very simple I believed

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.340 
achieved very very simple I believed
this<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.580> most<00:02:35.760> simple<00:02:36.350> Ram

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
this one the most simple Ram

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.650 
this one the most simple Ram
installation<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.459> ever<00:02:38.700> done<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.180> mini

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
installation I ever done on a mini

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.710 
installation I ever done on a mini
previous<00:02:40.170> mini<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.770> not<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.130> simple<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
previous mini it's not so simple and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.290 
previous mini it's not so simple and
push<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.470> down<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.950> anger<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.580> not<00:02:44.790> force<00:02:45.180> it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
push it down at anger do not force it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.010 
push it down at anger do not force it
into<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:47.040> angle<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.120> little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.600> too<00:02:48.810> low

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
into this angle is a little bit too low

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.650 
into this angle is a little bit too low
so<00:02:49.100> actually<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.280> angle<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.760> slightly<00:02:50.970> higher

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
so actually the angle is slightly higher

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.860 
so actually the angle is slightly higher
so<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.709> actually<00:02:52.830> made<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> mistake<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.420> do

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
so I actually made a mistake here so do

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.010 
so I actually made a mistake here so do
not<00:02:55.070> do<00:02:56.070> what<00:02:56.370> I'm<00:02:56.580> doing<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.930> see

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
not do what I'm doing so you can see

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.170 
not do what I'm doing so you can see
that<00:02:58.380> once<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.980> push<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> slightly<00:02:59.550> English<00:03:00.030> it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
that once I push it slightly English it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
that once I push it slightly English it
actually<00:03:00.450> bounced<00:03:00.660> back<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
actually bounced back up that is the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.970 
actually bounced back up that is the
correct<00:03:01.890> angle<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.310> push<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:04.230> will

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
correct angle to push it in so you will

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.729 
correct angle to push it in so you will
not<00:03:05.220> damage<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.940> connector<00:03:06.450> part<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.410> is

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
not damage the connector part so this is

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.110 
not damage the connector part so this is
the<00:03:07.920> correct<00:03:08.250> angle<00:03:08.400> which<00:03:08.820> is<00:03:08.850> slightly

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the correct angle which is slightly

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.050 
the correct angle which is slightly
higher<00:03:09.270> up<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.020> once<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.430> know<00:03:11.489> place

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
higher up and once it's you know place

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.750 
higher up and once it's you know place
in<00:03:12.360> properly<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.320> press<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.950> down<00:03:14.190> gently

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
in properly just press it down gently

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.000 
in properly just press it down gently
and<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.150> hear<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> satisfying<00:03:16.290> click<00:03:16.470> and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and you hear the satisfying click and

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.640 
and you hear the satisfying click and
from<00:03:17.400> here<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.780> put<00:03:18.780> back<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> cover<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
from here you put back the cover and

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.210 
from here you put back the cover and
turn<00:03:20.610> clockwise<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.989> white<00:03:22.830> dot<00:03:23.070> is

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
turn clockwise so that the white dot is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.729 
turn clockwise so that the white dot is
on<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.489> black<00:03:23.820> dog<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.660> would<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.840> secured
