00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.580
 why 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.330
 i 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.590
 for a long time neo geo was the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.260
 Pija console that everyone envied 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.170
 it was excessively expensive but its games 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.770
 they were very good some of these could 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.900
 even play in arcades and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.360
 among them we found the metals 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.629
 lark these scroll development games 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.290
 lateral achieved great success delivery 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.220
 after delivery thanks to its gameplay 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.470
 advancing through the different scenarios 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.760
 always from left to right in 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.250
 scenarios that were moving 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.160
 laterally we had to eliminate the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.780
 enemies and save the prisoners what 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.149
 funny was given by his look 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 characteristic and by certain violence to 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.890
 kill the enemies to whom 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.500
 We stabs even if we were going so 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.869
 close enough to expand the power 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.210
 weaponry was possible thanks to the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.880
 different icons and we are picking up by 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.039
 the way at a certain moment even 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.110
 We took some vehicle or animal to 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.730
 save certain distances or attack with 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.010
 greater power 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.750
 there were different deliveries in which 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.300
 new characters were entering 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.970
 selectable each with their own 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.760
 weapons and actions visiting new 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.410
 Locations in addition with each delivery 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.420
 it was getting better that we changed 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.970
 aspects as we were affected by an attack 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.100
 enemy or not slowing us or 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.920
 becoming zombie among many 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 other fun actions 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.180
 its striking graphical section and its 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.250
 difficulty in crescendo were part 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.619
 fundamental of the fun of this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.439
 product that made us spend many hours 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.390
 before the recreational ones many of those 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.549
 deliveries were published for accuracy 2 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.159
 and some of them were also published 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.340
 for xbox although not all nor the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.799
 compilation of which we spoke to tolo 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 if it was published in the year 2006 celebrating 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.289
 10 years of the franchise and incorporated 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.350
 all metals from 1 to 6 plus 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.890
 metal slack x offering each delivery 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.150
 the same graphic appearance as the original 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.280
 although currently it is difficult to find 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.980
 this compilation in precision 2 to which 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.400
 correspond these images is still 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 possible to find the version for two and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 in the next sensation chapter 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.940
 history and by popular request 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.940
 we remember urban chaos
