00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
really depend on the situations but

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
really depend on the situations but
there<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.500> times<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.189> where<00:01:23.729> someone

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
there will be times like where someone

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
there will be times like where someone
will<00:01:24.210> open<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> button<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.140> small<00:01:25.500> binders

will open the button or small binders

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.460 
will open the button or small binders
then<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.420> very<00:01:27.810> wide<00:01:28.110> range<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
then they will have a very wide range of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
then they will have a very wide range of
amps<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.280> probably<00:01:29.549> shove<00:01:30.090> like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
amps and you can probably shove like

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.469 
amps and you can probably shove like
maybe<00:01:30.570> 30<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:31.650> even<00:01:31.680> 35<00:01:32.400> big<00:01:32.610> monitors<00:01:33.000> like

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
maybe 30 or even 35 big monitors like

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
maybe 30 or even 35 big monitors like
that<00:01:33.720> especially<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> marginal<00:01:34.740> hand

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

your decision to see a blob versus
moving<00:01:54.799> all<00:01:55.039> in<00:01:55.219> preflop<00:01:55.700> like<00:01:56.240> they're

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
moving all in preflop like they're

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.600 
moving all in preflop like they're
certainly<00:01:57.039> ranges<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.159> can<00:01:58.280> come<00:01:58.460> up<00:01:58.490> with

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
certainly ranges you can come up with

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.469 
certainly ranges you can come up with
where<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.630> hand<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:00.350> do<00:02:01.210> sentences<00:02:02.210> are

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
where a hand like do sentences are

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.630 
where a hand like do sentences are
probably<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.530> know<00:02:03.649> they<00:02:03.829> have<00:02:04.009> about<00:02:04.219> the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
probably you know they have about the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.399 
probably you know they have about the
same<00:02:04.670> amount<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.270> chance<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.869> winning<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.200> rock

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
same amount of chance of winning to rock

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.139 
same amount of chance of winning to rock
but<00:02:06.860> there<00:02:07.009> are<00:02:07.069> so<00:02:07.250> many<00:02:07.310> more<00:02:07.610> better<00:02:07.850> clubs

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
but there are so many more better clubs

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.699 
but there are so many more better clubs
with<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> hand<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.750> Jackson<00:02:09.229> Suzanne

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
with a hand like Jackson Suzanne

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.100 
with a hand like Jackson Suzanne
personal<00:02:10.160> uses<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.180> if<00:02:11.269> I<00:02:11.330> was<00:02:11.480> facing<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.900> trace

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
personal uses so if I was facing a trace

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.710 
personal uses so if I was facing a trace
I<00:02:12.440> would<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> lot<00:02:13.459> more<00:02:13.640> likely<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.480> show<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
I would be a lot more likely to show the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.240 
I would be a lot more likely to show the
hand<00:02:14.959> like<00:02:15.140> juices<00:02:15.500> from<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.680> big<00:02:15.890> boy<00:02:16.069> then

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
hand like juices from the big boy then

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.140 
hand like juices from the big boy then
again<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.790> nice<00:02:17.269> suit<00:02:17.860> potentially<00:02:19.030> thanks<00:02:20.030> to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
again a nice suit potentially thanks to
