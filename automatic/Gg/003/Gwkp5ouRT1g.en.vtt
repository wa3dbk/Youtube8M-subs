hey guys it's my review the m14 EDR

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.900 
hey guys it's my review the m14 EDR
which<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.890> available<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.490> black<00:00:08.700> market

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
which is available in the black market

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820 
which is available in the black market
I'll<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.630> giving<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> damage<00:00:10.410> stats<00:00:10.650> as

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
I'll be giving all the damage stats as

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.680 
I'll be giving all the damage stats as
well<00:00:11.010> as<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> comparison<00:00:11.670> against<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.269> K<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
well as a comparison against the a K and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.499 
well as a comparison against the a K and
the<00:00:12.809> m4<00:00:13.200> then<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.559> own<00:00:13.679> opinion<00:00:14.070> had<00:00:14.160> begun

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
the m4 then my own opinion had begun

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.730 
the m4 then my own opinion had begun
right<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.870> before<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.230> get<00:00:16.350> into<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
right and just before we get into the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
right and just before we get into the
damages<00:00:17.160> I'll<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.490> tell<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.000> it's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
damages I'll just tell you now that it's

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.210 
damages I'll just tell you now that it's
a<00:00:18.690> hundred<00:00:18.840> percent<00:00:19.080> wallbang<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.039> any

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
a hundred percent wallbang so any

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.830 
a hundred percent wallbang so any
damages<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.359> you'll<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.630> able

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
damages that you see here you'll be able

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.689 
damages that you see here you'll be able
to<00:00:22.050> shoot<00:00:22.230> through<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.590> box<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> same

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to shoot through a box and do the same

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.000 
to shoot through a box and do the same
so<00:00:24.180> close<00:00:25.140> range<00:00:25.470> you're<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
so close range you're going to do a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300 
so close range you're going to do a
hundred<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> head<00:00:26.910> between<00:00:27.390> 33<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.560> 34<00:00:29.099> to

27 to the chest and 31 to 32 to the body
at<00:00:43.440> mid-range<00:00:43.739> we'll<00:00:44.190> still<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> hundred<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
at mid-range we'll still do a hundred to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.049 
at mid-range we'll still do a hundred to
the<00:00:45.270> head<00:00:45.480> between<00:00:45.840> 31<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.890> 32<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> chest

74 to the head 20 to the chess and 24 to
the<00:01:12.960> body<00:01:14.689> now<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> comparisons<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.920> m14

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the body now on the comparisons the m14

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
the body now on the comparisons the m14
actually<00:01:17.909> has<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> fastest<00:01:18.600> firing<00:01:18.869> rate<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
actually has the fastest firing rate of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
actually has the fastest firing rate of
all<00:01:19.439> three<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> m4<00:01:20.310> second<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> AKS<00:01:21.450> third

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
all three the m4 second in the AKS third

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.660 
all three the m4 second in the AKS third
and<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.350> such<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> small<00:01:23.009> difference<00:01:23.220> I'll

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and it's such a small difference I'll

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
and it's such a small difference I'll
repaired<00:01:24.000> again<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.299> slow<00:01:24.540> motion<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
repaired again in slow motion so that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
repaired again in slow motion so that
you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.560 

you

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.999 

reload<00:01:39.570> wise<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.020> m4<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
reload wise the m4 is actually the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.730 
reload wise the m4 is actually the
slowest<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.909> m14<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> fastest<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
slowest the m14 is the fastest in the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
slowest the m14 is the fastest in the
AKS<00:01:44.100> second<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> I'll<00:01:44.880> replay<00:01:45.119> again<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.540> slow

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
AKS second and I'll replay again in slow

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.969 
AKS second and I'll replay again in slow
motion<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
motion so that you can see the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:56.160 
motion so that you can see the
difference

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.020 

for<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.229> draw<00:01:57.439> speed<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> m14<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.640> actually

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
for the draw speed the m14 is actually

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.480 
for the draw speed the m14 is actually
the<00:01:59.150> slowest<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> 3<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.080> aks<00:02:00.740> second<00:02:01.310> and

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the slowest of the 3 that aks second and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.969 
the slowest of the 3 that aks second and
then<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> m4<00:02:01.909> is<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.570> fastest<00:02:03.140> our<00:02:03.440> that

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
then the m4 is the fastest our that

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.710 
then the m4 is the fastest our that
again<00:02:04.220> in<00:02:04.340> slow<00:02:04.369> motion<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.390> can<00:02:05.540> see

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it's takes low amounts of skill to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.900 
it's takes low amounts of skill to
