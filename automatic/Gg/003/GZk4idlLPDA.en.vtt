right now I used to draw a lot as a kid
I<00:00:49.320> used<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> draw<00:00:49.860> instead<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.760> spending<00:00:51.360> time

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> math<00:00:51.960> classes<00:00:52.289> I've<00:00:52.770> been<00:00:52.949> always

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
on the math classes I've been always

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.299 
on the math classes I've been always
drawing<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.239> since<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.170> computer<00:00:55.620> my

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
drawing but since I got my computer my

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.790 
drawing but since I got my computer my
hand<00:00:56.730> gets<00:00:57.000> stiff<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.600> can't<00:00:57.960> draw<00:00:58.199> anymore<00:00:58.440> as

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
hand gets stiff I can't draw anymore as

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.610 
hand gets stiff I can't draw anymore as
I<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> kid<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.260> huge

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
I was as a kid and that's the huge

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.670 
I was as a kid and that's the huge
disadvantage<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.609> computer<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
disadvantage of the computer but in the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950 
disadvantage of the computer but in the
way<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> sense<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:06.030> transforming<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
way in the sense I'm transforming it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.640 
way in the sense I'm transforming it
into<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:08.070> computer-generated

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.160 

somewhere<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:16.060> subconsciously<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.360> think

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
somewhere in a subconsciously I think

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.740 
somewhere in a subconsciously I think
slightly<00:01:18.549> different<00:01:19.549> for<00:01:20.119> some<00:01:20.330> reason<00:01:20.600> I

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
slightly different for some reason I

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.820 
slightly different for some reason I
don't<00:01:20.810> know<00:01:20.960> why<00:01:21.049> there<00:01:21.409> was<00:01:21.500> something

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
don't know why there was something

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.980 
don't know why there was something
something<00:01:22.100> polish<00:01:22.610> in<00:01:22.700> me<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.119> tend<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.659> think

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
something polish in me I tend to think

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.460 
something polish in me I tend to think
in<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.590> metaphor<00:01:25.070> basis<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.000> say<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:26.570> love<00:01:27.200> this

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
in a metaphor basis I say I love this

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.710 
in a metaphor basis I say I love this
approach<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.189> I've<00:01:28.610> been<00:01:28.850> teaching<00:01:29.299> this<00:01:29.659> for

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
approach and I've been teaching this for

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.289 
approach and I've been teaching this for
it<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.200> quite<00:01:30.380> some<00:01:30.590> time<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:31.040> love<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:32.030> see

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
it for quite some time I love to see

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.249 
it for quite some time I love to see
things<00:01:32.869> here<00:01:33.680> simple<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:34.460> not<00:01:34.700> too<00:01:34.940> simple

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
things here simple but not too simple

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.170 
things here simple but not too simple
when<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.350> make<00:01:36.470> them<00:01:36.619> too<00:01:36.799> simple<00:01:37.250> they<00:01:37.729> won't

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
when you make them too simple they won't

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.359 
when you make them too simple they won't
make<00:01:38.299> sense<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.289> it's<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.710> it's<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.979> really<00:01:40.190> thin

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
make sense so it's a it's a really thin

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.850 
make sense so it's a it's a really thin
line<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.820> make<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.149> simple<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.860> recognizable

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
line to make it simple and recognizable

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.380 
line to make it simple and recognizable
for<00:01:43.039> most<00:01:43.220> people<00:01:45.670> we<00:01:46.670> are<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.940> age<00:01:47.060> where

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
for most people we are in the age where

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.350 
for most people we are in the age where
Twitter<00:01:47.869> creates<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.860> base<00:01:49.280> for<00:01:49.550> everything<00:01:50.000> so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
Twitter creates a base for everything so

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.690 
Twitter creates a base for everything so
we<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.840> think<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.440> little<00:01:51.950> bit<00:01:52.190> outside<00:01:52.340> of

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
we have to think a little bit outside of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.680 
we have to think a little bit outside of
the<00:01:53.030> box<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:54.710> box<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.000> if<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.509> imagine

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
the box of the box so if you can imagine

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.480 
the box of the box so if you can imagine
box<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.289> box<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.649> have<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.890> think<00:01:58.100> outside<00:01:58.190> of

box in a box we have to think outside of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.570 
box in a box we have to think outside of
the<00:01:58.729> second<00:01:59.090> box<00:01:59.240> -<00:01:59.569> I<00:01:59.810> think<00:02:00.380> I'm<00:02:00.770> ahead<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
the second box - I think I'm ahead a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.059 
the second box - I think I'm ahead a
little<00:02:01.759> bit<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.450> curve<00:02:02.780> with<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.350> usage

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
little bit of the curve with the usage

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.330 
little bit of the curve with the usage
of<00:02:04.220> 3d<00:02:04.759> 3d<00:02:05.360> software<00:02:05.649> tend<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.920> be<00:02:07.069> really

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
of 3d 3d software tend to be really

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.729 
of 3d 3d software tend to be really
complicated<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.090> still<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:08.929> as<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.590> one

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
complicated and still is but as the one

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.170 
complicated and still is but as the one
person<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.549> do<00:02:10.729> way<00:02:11.000> more<00:02:11.030> than<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:12.019> than

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
person I can do way more than that than

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.520 
person I can do way more than that than
average<00:02:14.180> let's<00:02:14.540> say<00:02:14.660> average<00:02:14.780> art<00:02:15.140> director
