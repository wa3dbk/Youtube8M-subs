00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
i kind of am getting to the point where

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.390 
i kind of am getting to the point where
i<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.750> i<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.020> straight<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:20.040> i

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
i like it as much as i do straight if i

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
i like it as much as i do straight if i
like<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> same<00:01:21.390> amount<00:01:21.509> curly<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

straight so yeah i thought that i would
just<00:01:25.979> address<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> few<00:01:26.880> things<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:28.170> feel<00:01:28.619> like

there<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> pressure<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:31.170> girls

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
there is a lot of pressure for girls

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.870 
there is a lot of pressure for girls
with<00:01:31.799> curly<00:01:32.009> hair<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.280> straighten<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> at

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
with curly hair to straighten it at

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760 
with curly hair to straighten it at
least<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> area<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> i<00:01:33.689> live<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.079> because

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
least in the area that i live in because

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
least in the area that i live in because
most<00:01:35.189> girls<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.270> curly<00:01:36.600> hair<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:37.140> straighten

their hair um i guess it's just kind of
an<00:01:40.619> easy<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.850> everything<00:01:42.210> look<00:01:42.479> all

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
everything um so that's like my first

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
everything um so that's like my first
thing<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.540> need<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.930> write<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.710> off

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
thing you just need to write that off

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.160 
thing you just need to write that off
get<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.270> head<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.840> doesn't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
get it out of your head that it doesn't

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.440 
get it out of your head that it doesn't
look<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:16.410> good<00:02:16.440> because<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.250> look<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.820> as

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
look as good because it can look just as

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.510 
look as good because it can look just as
good<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.350> think<00:02:19.590> girls<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.220> curly<00:02:20.400> hair

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
good and I think girls with curly hair

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.970 
good and I think girls with curly hair
and<00:02:20.670> straight<00:02:21.120> hair<00:02:21.300> or<00:02:21.330> both<00:02:21.630> beautiful

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
and straight hair or both beautiful

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.420 
and straight hair or both beautiful
everyone's<00:02:22.980> beautiful<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:24.600> um<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.260> don't<00:02:26.250> know

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
everyone's beautiful but um I don't know

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.250 
everyone's beautiful but um I don't know
I<00:02:26.640> think<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.180> that's<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> first<00:02:27.930> thing<00:02:27.990> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
I think that that's the first thing you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440 
I think that that's the first thing you
need<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.700> second<00:02:30.030> thing<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.210> you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
need to do and the second thing that you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.360 
need to do and the second thing that you
need<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.630> realize<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:31.530> your<00:02:31.650> curly<00:02:31.950> hair<00:02:31.980> is

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
need to realize with your curly hair is

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
need to realize with your curly hair is
it's<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.880> going<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.360> look<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.930> models

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it's not going to look like the models

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.490 
it's not going to look like the models
curly<00:02:34.650> hair<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> magazine<00:02:35.490> because<00:02:35.880> uh

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
curly hair in the magazine because uh

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.190 
curly hair in the magazine because uh
that<00:02:37.500> has<00:02:37.680> probably<00:02:38.130> been<00:02:38.870> totally<00:02:39.870> curled

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
that has probably been totally curled

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.650 
that has probably been totally curled

curling iron and what I leave natural um

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.310 
curling iron and what I leave natural um
but<00:02:56.400> yeah<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.850> need<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> not<00:02:57.660> look<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:57.960> my<00:02:58.080> hair

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
but yeah you need to not look at my hair

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.840 
but yeah you need to not look at my hair
and<00:02:58.500> say<00:02:58.680> oh<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.920> want<00:02:59.310> my<00:02:59.400> curly<00:02:59.640> hair<00:02:59.730> look

and say oh I want my curly hair look
like<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.240> because<00:03:01.760> curls<00:03:02.760> curl<00:03:03.270> differently

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
like that because curls curl differently

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.460 
like that because curls curl differently
that's<00:03:04.080> just<00:03:04.200> how<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.500> works<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.490> um<00:03:06.470> that's

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
that's just how it works so um that's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.410 
that's just how it works so um that's
another<00:03:07.830> thing<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.550> need<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.910> kind<00:03:09.300> of

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
another thing that you need to kind of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.240 
another thing that you need to kind of
get<00:03:09.600> get<00:03:10.140> out<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.440> way<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.100> you'll

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
get get out of the way and then you'll

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.620 
get get out of the way and then you'll
you'll<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> more<00:03:11.850> comfortable<00:03:11.910> with<00:03:12.420> yourself

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
you'll be more comfortable with yourself

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.229 
you'll be more comfortable with yourself
and<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.860> third<00:03:14.040> thing<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.850> think<00:03:15.000> that

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
and the third thing that I think that

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.690 
and the third thing that I think that
you<00:03:15.480> need<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.840> kind<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.290> banish<00:03:16.770> which<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.459> feel

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
you need to kind of banish which I feel

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.300 
you need to kind of banish which I feel
like<00:03:17.910> maybe<00:03:18.600> it's<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:18.930> me<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.890> feel<00:03:20.280> like

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
like maybe it's just me but I feel like

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.370 
like maybe it's just me but I feel like
it's<00:03:20.520> probably<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:21.270> because<00:03:21.600> any<00:03:21.959> girls<00:03:22.200> who

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
it's probably not because any girls who

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229 
it's probably not because any girls who
watch<00:03:22.650> millionaire<00:03:23.070> matchmaker<00:03:23.580> have

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
watch millionaire matchmaker have

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.420 
watch millionaire matchmaker have
