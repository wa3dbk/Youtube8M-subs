could see

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.590 
could see
it's<00:04:23.090> getting<00:04:24.020> dull<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.670> future<00:04:26.030> maybe<00:04:26.210> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
it's getting dull in the future maybe a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.870 
it's getting dull in the future maybe a
year<00:04:26.990> or<00:04:27.050> two<00:04:27.320> from<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:28.100> could<00:04:28.490> possibly

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
year or two from now it could possibly

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.090 
year or two from now it could possibly

would<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.330> buy<00:04:59.600> a<00:05:00.340> theoretical<00:05:01.340> another

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
would you buy a theoretical another

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.330 
would you buy a theoretical another
minecraft<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:03.080> wasn't<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.770> same

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
minecraft that wasn't the same

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.740 
minecraft that wasn't the same
you<00:05:04.430> know<00:05:04.550> maybe<00:05:04.880> they<00:05:05.120> changed<00:05:05.150> everything

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
you know maybe they changed everything

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.430 
you know maybe they changed everything
but<00:05:06.650> at<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.860> same<00:05:07.040> time<00:05:07.660> notch<00:05:08.660> one<00:05:09.020> do<00:05:09.230> that

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
but at the same time notch one do that

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.070 
but at the same time notch one do that
because<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:10.640> modding<00:05:11.060> community<00:05:11.090> could<00:05:11.840> just

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
because the modding community could just

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.160 
because the modding community could just
make<00:05:12.350> another<00:05:12.830> game<00:05:13.300> pretty<00:05:14.300> much<00:05:14.450> look<00:05:15.050> at

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170
