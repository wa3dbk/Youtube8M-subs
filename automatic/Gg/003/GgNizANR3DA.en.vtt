this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.750> my<00:00:00.900> best<00:00:01.140> friend<00:00:01.439> it's<00:00:02.070> designed<00:00:02.520> for

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
this is my best friend it's designed for

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.700 
this is my best friend it's designed for
nursing<00:00:03.179> but<00:00:03.419> once<00:00:03.689> I'm<00:00:03.870> done<00:00:04.020> nursing<00:00:04.529> I

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
nursing but once I'm done nursing I

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.470 
nursing but once I'm done nursing I
think<00:00:04.950> I'm<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.310> gonna<00:00:05.460> keep<00:00:06.089> wearing<00:00:06.359> her

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
think I'm just gonna keep wearing her

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.179 
think I'm just gonna keep wearing her
around<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> house<00:00:06.990> she<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.010> have<00:00:08.099> become

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
around the house she and I have become

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.820 
around the house she and I have become
very<00:00:08.429> close<00:00:14.450> my<00:00:15.450> breast<00:00:15.719> friend's<00:00:16.139> frenemy<00:00:16.619> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
very close my breast friend's frenemy is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.870 
very close my breast friend's frenemy is
the<00:00:17.340> boppie

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the boppie

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.359 
the boppie
now<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.500> much<00:00:19.920> more<00:00:20.100> comfortable

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
now this is so much more comfortable

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.609 
now this is so much more comfortable
than<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:21.900> you're<00:00:22.080> choosing<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
than this and if you're choosing a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.259 
than this and if you're choosing a
nursing<00:00:23.039> pillow<00:00:23.189> then<00:00:23.490> listen<00:00:23.939> closely

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
nursing pillow then listen closely

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.700 
nursing pillow then listen closely
because<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> make<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> big

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
because this is going to make a big

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
because this is going to make a big
difference<00:00:26.000> most<00:00:27.000> people<00:00:27.240> don't<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
difference most people don't know that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.630 
difference most people don't know that
the<00:00:27.840> boppie<00:00:28.050> wasn't<00:00:28.619> actually<00:00:29.039> designed<00:00:29.460> for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the boppie wasn't actually designed for

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
the boppie wasn't actually designed for
nursing<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.570> designed<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> pillow<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
nursing it was designed as a pillow to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
nursing it was designed as a pillow to
help<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.009> baby<00:00:32.189> learn<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.640> sit<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
help the baby learn to sit up it's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
help the baby learn to sit up it's
useful<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.350> both<00:00:34.469> things<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.280> isn't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
useful for both things but it isn't

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
useful for both things but it isn't
exactly<00:00:35.820> ideal<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.989> nursing<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
exactly ideal for nursing because the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
exactly ideal for nursing because the
curvature<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.670> makes<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.969> harder<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> keep

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
curvature here makes it harder to keep

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.690 
curvature here makes it harder to keep
older<00:00:40.110> babies<00:00:40.440> positioned<00:00:40.980> correctly<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
older babies positioned correctly and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
older babies positioned correctly and
there's<00:00:42.300> no<00:00:42.450> back<00:00:42.660> support<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.290> mommy<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
there's no back support for mommy so I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
there's no back support for mommy so I
often<00:00:44.219> find<00:00:44.370> myself<00:00:44.489> searching<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> pillow

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
often find myself searching for a pillow

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
often find myself searching for a pillow
but<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> met<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.829> best<00:00:47.039> friend<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> now

best<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.080> stay<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.580> has

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
best to stay put if you can it also has

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
best to stay put if you can it also has
this<00:01:24.030> contoured<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:24.960> support<00:01:25.470> which<00:01:25.650> is

this contoured back support which is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
this contoured back support which is
much<00:01:26.280> appreciated<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.570> helps<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> sit<00:01:28.439> up

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
much appreciated it helps you sit up

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.350 
much appreciated it helps you sit up
straight<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.549> ideal<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.939> letting

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
straight which is more ideal for letting

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.510 
straight which is more ideal for letting
your<00:01:30.479> milk<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.409> also<00:01:31.710> keeps<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.220> nursing

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
your milk down it also keeps you nursing

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
your milk down it also keeps you nursing
longer<00:01:33.180> since<00:01:33.450> you're<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.810> comfortable

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
longer since you're more comfortable

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
longer since you're more comfortable
which<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.890> important<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.790> first

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
which is important because at first

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
which is important because at first
nursing<00:01:36.600> takes<00:01:36.810> forever<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.009> babies<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.490> get

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
nursing takes forever the babies do get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
nursing takes forever the babies do get
faster<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.509> they're<00:01:39.689> infants<00:01:40.170> best<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
faster but when they're infants best to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
faster but when they're infants best to
strap<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
strap in because you're gonna be there a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630
