00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.009
 Sunday afternoon and thus time for the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 formula 1 this weekend it leads us 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.820
 after silverstone the green English 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.740
 landscape where the teams are just last 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.880
 preparations for the big prize of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.880
 meet britain 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.820
 here we see the starting lineup and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.820
 soon it starts 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 after last year's formula 1 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.179
 do not play on the newest 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 technical stand was was f1 2015 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.920
 properly drilled and appears 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.630
 first time on the ps4 and xbox fans loud 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 Developer codemasters became everything 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.750
 newly developed and no assets from the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.210
 past parts taken over 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 graphically that is undoubtedly great in 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.960
 things gameplay and long-term motivation 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.960
 but not necessarily an advance 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.739
 especially the ki often allows 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.089
 Wish you should often times 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.280
 It is recommended to play racing games 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.170
 at least directly on hard to start 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.489
 and here you drive the rival as well 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 to see it quickly here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.689
 In addition, the people to be perturbed disturb 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.700
 driver barely on blue flags and on 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.320
 your boxing crew is a bit stupid and calls 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.399
 you and your teammates very often 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.399
 at the same time in the box 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.400
 especially striking is that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 the ki driver too much on the ideal line 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.920
 glue 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.690
 even in rainy weather they are racing 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.970
 Colleagues lined up nicely in a row 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.460
 over the track risky overtaking maneuvers 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.810
 or positional battles are observed at 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.810
 Unfortunately they are rare 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.840
 the opponents are harmless by it 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.340
 but do not defend your ideal line 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.380
 They aggressive and then ram you too 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.970
 ever gladly from the track is there 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.990
 It's good that the well-known return game 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.990
 feature is on board again 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 By the way, there is no safety pack 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.020
 more 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.569
 that was canceled as well as the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.610
 career mode is the former though 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.140
 annoying but bearable pushes the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.560
 Missing career huge on the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 long-term motivation 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.410
 but of course that's not all 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.640
 bad codemasters typical can be 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.950
 the driving behavior at will 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.660
 and no matter if you are now working 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.850
 or simulation-heavy silk road 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.470
 The races also make a lot of fun 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.300
 especially in the rain, the title does not look 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.260
 just great but plays 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.660
 even more demanding 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.670
 In addition, the soundscape is outstanding 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.380
 the various engine noises that 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.300
 patter of rain thunder in the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.000
 background everything is good and audible 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.010
 contributes to the atmosphere possible 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.390
 also succeeded the new profi 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.220
 Mode in which you without hat and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.570
 driving aids with the ki on the highest 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.940
 stage a championship season 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.100
 nachspielt the new mode does indeed need 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.500
 a lot of training but offers a great 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.750
 simulation of the formula 1 we recommend 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.750
 but clearly a steering wheel 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.329
 Moreover, it is also possible this time 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.000
 reenact past season 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.590
 the formula 1 year 2014 is complete with 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.280
 all stretch teams and drivers 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.319
 contain 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.849
 that is certainly a nice bonus 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.569
 Missing career mode makes it but 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.569
 not gone either 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.370
 f1 2015 is a decent one as well 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.069
 not an outstanding game 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 missing modes and the more mediocre ones 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.159
 unfortunately very much on the overall impression 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.900
 just the career mode becomes 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.340
 painful who misses it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.049
 can do without one more than 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.760
 decent racing with formula 1 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.109
 License everyone else might wait 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.549
 better until next year 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.109
 then it's supposed to be one again 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.400
 Give career and some of the mistakes 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.400
 are probably canceled by then
