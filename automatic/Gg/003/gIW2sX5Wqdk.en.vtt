sunglasses really are we discussed a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.220

ultimately decided to run them over with

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.530 
ultimately decided to run them over with
a<00:00:12.630> Cadillac<00:00:13.110> CTS<00:00:13.679> now<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.940> isn't<00:00:15.150> covered

under your lifetime warranty but it will

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.130 
under your lifetime warranty but it will
show<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> how<00:00:18.029> strong<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.810> sunglasses

really<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:19.980> let's<00:00:20.730> get<00:00:20.880> started

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.319 

there<00:00:37.989> we<00:00:38.109> go<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:42.670> don't<00:00:43.000> know<00:00:43.089> if<00:00:43.179> that

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
there we go well I don't know if that

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.389 
there we go well I don't know if that
was<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.600> best<00:00:43.780> idea<00:00:43.989> but<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.440> should<00:00:44.980> revert

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
was the best idea but it should revert

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.849 
was the best idea but it should revert
back<00:00:45.519> to<00:00:45.699> its<00:00:45.729> original<00:00:45.909> form

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
back to its original form

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.810 
back to its original form
well<00:00:47.859> now<00:00:47.949> that<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.190> frame<00:00:48.370> popped<00:00:48.640> back<00:00:48.760> into

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
well now that the frame popped back into

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.000 
well now that the frame popped back into
shape<00:00:49.239> I<00:00:49.420> needed<00:00:49.690> only<00:00:49.929> to<00:00:50.079> reinstall<00:00:50.859> the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
shape I needed only to reinstall the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.680 
shape I needed only to reinstall the
scratch<00:00:51.250> resistant<00:00:51.729> lenses<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.539> whole

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
scratch resistant lenses the whole

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.060 
scratch resistant lenses the whole
process<00:00:52.929> took<00:00:53.199> about<00:00:53.379> two<00:00:53.649> minutes<00:00:53.799> so<00:00:54.010> I'm

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
process took about two minutes so I'm

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.500 
process took about two minutes so I'm
going<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.250> speed<00:00:54.579> it<00:00:54.670> up<00:00:54.760> see<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.269> on<00:00:55.390> the
