00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.160
 shell eco marathon 2013 we are in emilia 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 romagna land of engines behind me 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.600
 a ferrari carries as a sponsor shell 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.180
 so what does ecology have to do with it? 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.410
 Gasoline does because ecology shell 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.619
 it is already a long time that promotes one 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 very interesting race in Rotterdam 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.390
 this year is what it consists of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.369
 take a liter of gasoline 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 transform it into energy equivalent 44 thousand 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.290
 joule and consists in recovering 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.190
 lots of internationals with this one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.720
 energy must invent a prototype 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.760
 build it take it broken and try to 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.180
 make your own kilometers as possible 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.890
 with a liter of petrol equivalent 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.020
 they'll make it, I'll be ambassador of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.079
 two teams let's get to know them and here we are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.390
 a liti ipsia di maranello obviously yes 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.340
 call ferrari but don't talk here 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 petrol engines but engines 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.989
 gasoline, however, has something to do with it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.990
 for the eco marathon shell they will have to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 do more kilometers with this prototype 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.159
 possible last year they did 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.729
 just over 1800 this year then the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.500
 your goal 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.750
 our goal this year will be to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.760
 at least make 2,000 kilometers or 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 liter equivalent of petrol 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.869
 excellent jobs are in full swing even though now 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.240
 the workshop is empty but as you see the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.760
 tools are there on the ground 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 I give him a big good luck 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.780
 and of course we'll see you in Rotterdam e 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 we will follow your performances step by step 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.720
 since you are the pilot and theirs 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.430
 performance since they built 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.830
 this product in the middle 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.159
 meanwhile the wolf is cracking and I thank you 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.439
 we hope for decent results 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.259
 well now we are in carpi at the Leonard 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.470
 we win with federico team manager 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.009
 of escorpio just scorpi our 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.020
 prototype that this year comes 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.550
 powered by an ion battery of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 lithium e 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.440
 it differs from that of the year 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.210
 last because we were turning hydrogen and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.840
 we decided to upset a little 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.630
 our plans 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.360
 last year you won an important one 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 prize this night goals you have 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.600
 to win another one, let's not try 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 however to get results 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.220
 ladies and in short we try cirov e 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.310
 we are working on it we had 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.110
 some difficulties due also 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.850
 accessibility to school and we have 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.590
 had the laboratories closed for different 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.960
 time due to the May earthquake 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.040
 of last year 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.870
 in short, the last pulled or in which 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 let's work to develop the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.860
 project the maximum possible 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.870
 they do everything by themselves from research 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.870
 of the construction loans of the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.090
 transportation machine in rotterdam then 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.220
 good luck and congratulations 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.200
 see in rotterdam because i will be the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.370
 then your ambassador or boys 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.630
 we must go all out 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.630
 ah yes goodbye all 8
