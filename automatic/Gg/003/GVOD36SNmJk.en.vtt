things up well we have a different
director<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.500> time<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> style<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.550> be

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
director this time so the style will be

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.709 
director this time so the style will be
a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.000> different<00:01:00.390> they're<00:01:00.570> both

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
a little bit different they're both

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630

this one is more like the book is it

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.550

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
hard to hang a movie when it's based on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840 
hard to hang a movie when it's based on
a<00:01:51.620> book<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.130> there<00:01:52.280> are<00:01:52.370> those<00:01:52.490> expectations

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
a book and there are those expectations

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.290 
a book and there are those expectations
from<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> die-hard<00:01:54.410> pre-existing<00:01:55.340> fans<00:01:55.610> well

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.350 
from the die-hard pre-existing fans well
I<00:01:56.330> think<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:56.810> great<00:01:57.020> because<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:58.300> know<00:01:59.300> you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
I think it's great because you know you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.810 
I think it's great because you know you
already<00:01:59.780> have<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.680> fan<00:02:00.950> base<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.430> is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
already have this this fan base that is

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.670 
already have this this fan base that is
excited<00:02:02.720> about<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.080> movie<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.500> first

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
excited about the movie in the first

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.630 
excited about the movie in the first
place<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:03.950> you're<00:02:04.070> going<00:02:04.190> into<00:02:04.460> something

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
place so you're going into something

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.460 
place so you're going into something
where<00:02:04.850> people<00:02:04.910> are<00:02:05.210> excited<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:06.320> it's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
where people are excited I think it's

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.780 
where people are excited I think it's
two<00:02:06.620> different<00:02:06.740> mediums<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.520> think<00:02:07.670> people

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
two different mediums and I think people

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.370 
two different mediums and I think people
know<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.540> you<00:02:08.810> know<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.080> can't<00:02:09.259> be

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
know that that you know it can't be

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.350 
know that that you know it can't be
exactly<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.100> book<00:02:10.280> scripts<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:11.030> you

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
exactly like the book scripts are you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.680 
exactly like the book scripts are you
know<00:02:11.450> they<00:02:11.600> have<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> different<00:02:11.900> structure<00:02:12.440> but

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
know they have a different structure but

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.390 
know they have a different structure but
i'm<00:02:14.690> sure<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.620> know<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.800> want<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.190> do<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400
