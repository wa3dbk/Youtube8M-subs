okay<00:00:02.190> here<00:00:02.490> we<00:00:02.580> are<00:00:02.610> back<00:00:02.909> with<00:00:03.060> our<00:00:03.179> larynx

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay here we are back with our larynx

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.039 
okay here we are back with our larynx
we're<00:00:04.470> at<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.650> posterior<00:00:05.190> view<00:00:05.730> we<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.629> see

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
we're at the posterior view we can see

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.020 
we're at the posterior view we can see
see<00:00:07.950> if<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> written<00:00:08.550> oeid<00:00:08.700> we'll<00:00:08.820> stay

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
see if this is a written oeid we'll stay

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.470 
see if this is a written oeid we'll stay
on<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.360> air<00:00:09.480> but<00:00:10.429> one<00:00:11.429> second<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.150> we've<00:00:12.300> got

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
on the air but one second so we've got

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.629 
on the air but one second so we've got
the<00:00:12.630> hyoid<00:00:12.840> bone<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.500> thyroid<00:00:13.980> cartilage<00:00:14.460> and

the hyoid bone the thyroid cartilage and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.740 
the hyoid bone the thyroid cartilage and
white<00:00:14.849> got<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.900> orange<00:00:16.830> vocal<00:00:17.460> folds<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
white got the orange vocal folds the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.060 
white got the orange vocal folds the
blue<00:00:19.670> cricoid<00:00:20.670> cartilage<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> vocal

folds extending from the back of the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.970 
folds extending from the back of the
thyroid<00:00:25.199> cartilage<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> notch<00:00:26.539> to<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980

superior border of the posterior quickly

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
superior border of the posterior quickly
and<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and actually they they go to the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440 
and actually they they go to the
originals<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> sake<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
originals but just for the sake of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
originals but just for the sake of
making<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.870> model<00:00:37.350> I'd<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> get

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
making this model I'd have a way to get

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
making this model I'd have a way to get
them<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> stay<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.329> they're<00:00:39.450> actually

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
them to stay there so they're actually

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.920 
them to stay there so they're actually
attached<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.760> onto<00:00:41.760> these<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.629> annoyed

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
attached here onto these or it annoyed

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
attached here onto these or it annoyed
cartilages<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.770> yellow<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> muscles

cartilages in yellow and the muscles

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
cartilages in yellow and the muscles
that<00:00:48.329> we're<00:00:48.480> focusing<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that we're focusing on here are the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
that we're focusing on here are the
black<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> yellow<00:00:51.510> strands<00:00:52.230> which<00:00:52.559> are<00:00:52.680> known

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
black and yellow strands which are known

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.310 
black and yellow strands which are known
as<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> thyroarytenoid<00:00:53.899> muscles<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.230> they

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
as the thyroarytenoid muscles and they

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
as the thyroarytenoid muscles and they
have<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:55.710> parts<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
have two parts as you can see here that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
have two parts as you can see here that
would<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.539> embedded<00:00:58.170> inside<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.640> vocal<00:01:00.359> folds

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
would be embedded inside the vocal folds

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
would be embedded inside the vocal folds
they<00:01:00.930> would<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.980> external<00:01:02.460> part

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
they would not be on the external part

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.280 
they would not be on the external part
but<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> sake<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.750> video<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> see

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
but for the sake of this video to see

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.520 
but for the sake of this video to see
the<00:01:04.470> action<00:01:04.890> put<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> outside<00:01:06.530> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the action put them on the outside so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
the action put them on the outside so
the<00:01:07.770> thyroarytenoid<00:01:08.490> muscle<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.600> comprised

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the thyroarytenoid muscle is comprised

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
the thyroarytenoid muscle is comprised
of<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.200> main<00:01:10.350> muscles<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> thyroid

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
of two main muscles the thyroid

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
of two main muscles the thyroid
muscularis<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.630> known<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
muscularis also known as the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.010 
muscularis also known as the
thyroarytenoid<00:01:14.360> externus<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.750> here

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
thyroarytenoid externus which was here

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.789 
thyroarytenoid externus which was here
in<00:01:16.110> yellow<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:18.200> vocalist<00:01:19.200> muscle<00:01:19.650> which

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
in yellow and the vocalist muscle which

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.520 
in yellow and the vocalist muscle which
is<00:01:19.950> also<00:01:20.100> known<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> thyroarytenoid

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
is also known as the thyroarytenoid

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.070 
is also known as the thyroarytenoid
internists<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.799> black<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:24.080> when

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
internists which are black here when

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
internists which are black here when
contracted<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> thyroid<00:01:26.369> muscularis<00:01:27.030> muscle

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
contracted the thyroid muscularis muscle

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.010 
contracted the thyroid muscularis muscle
which<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.229> their<00:01:28.350> yellow<00:01:28.680> strands<00:01:30.020> shorten

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
which are their yellow strands shorten

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.039 
which are their yellow strands shorten
and<00:01:31.170> add<00:01:31.770> duct<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.549> same<00:01:32.820> time<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.450> really

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and add duct at the same time so really

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.819 
and add duct at the same time so really
what<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.420> pulled<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
what it is so if we if it was pulled the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.520 
what it is so if we if it was pulled the
orange<00:01:38.610> part<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.119> shorter<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
orange part would get shorter and a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.420 
orange part would get shorter and a
little<00:01:40.740> closer<00:01:40.950> together<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> vocalist

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
little closer together and the vocalist

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.789 
little closer together and the vocalist
when<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.079> when<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:48.380> when<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> tightened

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
when it when it's when it is tightened

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.310 
when it when it's when it is tightened
its<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.950> glottal<00:01:53.159> tenser<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.540> vocal

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
its a glottal tenser so the vocal

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.380 
its a glottal tenser so the vocal
ligament<00:01:55.770> ligament<00:01:56.250> gets<00:01:56.490> shorter<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
ligament ligament gets shorter and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
ligament ligament gets shorter and
thicker<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.520> way<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.270> frequency<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
thicker and in that way the frequency of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.420 
thicker and in that way the frequency of
the<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> vocal<00:02:02.040> fold<00:02:02.310> vibration

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
the of the vocal fold vibration

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.360 
the of the vocal fold vibration
decreases<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> therefore<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
decreases and therefore the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.780 
decreases and therefore the
pitch<00:02:07.670> that's<00:02:08.450> perceived<00:02:09.010> decreases<00:02:10.010> so

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
pitch that's perceived decreases so

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:25.130 
pitch that's perceived decreases so
these<00:02:10.970> are

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.990 

while<00:02:25.710> they<00:02:25.860> shorten<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.400> thicken<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> Volga

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
while they shorten and thicken the Volga

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.790 
while they shorten and thicken the Volga
Falls<00:02:28.820> okay<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.900> are<00:02:31.050> back<00:02:31.260> again<00:02:31.290> with<00:02:31.560> our

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
Falls okay we are back again with our

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.150 
Falls okay we are back again with our
larynx<00:02:32.040> another<00:02:32.820> posterior<00:02:33.510> view<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:35.040> have

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
larynx another posterior view we have

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.370 
larynx another posterior view we have
our<00:02:35.340> written<00:02:35.940> oeid<00:02:36.150> cartage<00:02:36.480> cartilages

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
our written oeid cartage cartilages

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.200 
our written oeid cartage cartilages
sitting<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.830> top<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> cricoid<00:02:38.640> cartilage

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
sitting on top of the cricoid cartilage

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.720 
sitting on top of the cricoid cartilage
and<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:40.050> last<00:02:40.290> video<00:02:40.710> we<00:02:41.040> talked<00:02:41.280> about<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and the last video we talked about the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.690 
and the last video we talked about the
posterior<00:02:42.510> cricoarytenoid<00:02:43.520> muscles<00:02:44.520> which

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
posterior cricoarytenoid muscles which

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.510 
posterior cricoarytenoid muscles which
are<00:02:44.820> abductors<00:02:45.540> or<00:02:45.690> openers<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.800> now<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> have

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
are abductors or openers and now I have

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.470 
are abductors or openers and now I have
added<00:02:47.730> these<00:02:49.430> muscles<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:51.120> are<00:02:51.270> made

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
added these muscles here that are made

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.960 
added these muscles here that are made
with<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.930> dark<00:02:52.230> blue<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.580> those<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
with this dark blue and those are the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
with this dark blue and those are the
lateral<00:02:55.459> cricoarytenoid<00:02:56.690> muscles<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.020> they

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
lateral cricoarytenoid muscles and they

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.770 
lateral cricoarytenoid muscles and they
are<00:02:58.740> adductors<00:02:59.400> or<00:02:59.640> closers<00:03:00.180> they<00:03:00.360> sort<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> do

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
are adductors or closers they sort of do

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.949 
are adductors or closers they sort of do
the<00:03:00.900> opposite<00:03:01.440> thing<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.920> what<00:03:02.280> our<00:03:02.959> posterior

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the opposite thing of what our posterior

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.830 
the opposite thing of what our posterior
cricoarytenoid<00:03:04.400> did<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.640> as<00:03:05.850> these<00:03:06.150> twists<00:03:06.630> in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
cricoarytenoid did so as these twists in

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.449 
cricoarytenoid did so as these twists in
the<00:03:06.930> opposite<00:03:07.470> direction<00:03:07.739> because<00:03:08.130> they're

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the opposite direction because they're

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.750 
the opposite direction because they're
now<00:03:08.640> pulled<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.930> way<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.560> my<00:03:11.100> dog<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.340> trying

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
now pulled this way and my dog is trying

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.060 
now pulled this way and my dog is trying
to<00:03:11.880> help<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:14.580> vocal<00:03:15.300> folds<00:03:15.720> closed<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.920> I

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
to help the vocal folds closed and I

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.940 
to help the vocal folds closed and I
just<00:03:17.310> lost<00:03:17.550> one<00:03:17.730> down<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> hole

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
just lost one down here in the hole

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.400 
just lost one down here in the hole
thanks<00:03:19.950> buster<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.630> here<00:03:24.840> we<00:03:24.959> go<00:03:25.050> let<00:03:25.140> me<00:03:25.230> get<00:03:25.380> a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
thanks buster so here we go let me get a

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.870 
thanks buster so here we go let me get a
little<00:03:25.530> closer<00:03:25.860> view<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.400> one<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.760> it's

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
little closer view of this one so it's

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.729 
little closer view of this one so it's
attaching<00:03:27.390> from<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.690> muscular<00:03:28.110> process<00:03:28.560> of

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
attaching from the muscular process of

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.710 
attaching from the muscular process of
the<00:03:28.830> arytenoid<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.680> side<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the arytenoid to the the side of the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.170 
the arytenoid to the the side of the
cricoid<00:03:33.720> cartilage<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.850> it's<00:03:36.000> going

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
cricoid cartilage here and so it's going

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.949 
cricoid cartilage here and so it's going
to<00:03:36.239> twist<00:03:36.709> this<00:03:37.709> way<00:03:38.090> which<00:03:39.090> causes<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.780> vocal

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to twist this way which causes the vocal

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.500 
to twist this way which causes the vocal
folds<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.530> close<00:03:40.799> as<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.370> opposite<00:03:41.940> action<00:03:42.330> of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
folds to close as the opposite action of

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.550 
folds to close as the opposite action of
the<00:03:44.299> posterior<00:03:45.299> cricoid<00:03:45.810> which<00:03:46.140> when<00:03:46.380> they

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the posterior cricoid which when they

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.930 
the posterior cricoid which when they
twist<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.100> pulls<00:03:47.370> them<00:03:48.360> open
