00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.509
 welcoming childhood friend leonid crayfish 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:04.609
 and in this video lessons we will come with you 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.010
 the next 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.819
 points 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.160
 this time we'll talk about how 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.219
 improve as for your 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 snapshots 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.330
 and and so percent I turn in modules 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.509
 corrections 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.650
 closing the excess 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.380
 the windows of which Moscow only distract from 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.779
 work 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.699
 so that she see better 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 prefect from using tools 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.410
 details i will choose 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.900
 pre and post mode 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.770
 so best in scale 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.300
 maximize 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.340
 for example, that's up to one hundred percent 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.900
 to see 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.000
 original image name after 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.830
 application of tools 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.820
 adjustments 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.170
 now open the panel right now 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.080
 detail section 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.420
 here we are with you 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.520
 there are several tools first 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.290
 it is a rarity 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.300
 and the second is noise reduction 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.950
 in the sums we'll talk next 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.280
 video lessons 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039
 we are now taking both 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.790
 work tool 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.640
 sharpness 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.110
 So 10 and 4 regulator size radius 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.290
 details 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.450
 and masking at what 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.750
 work with these tools 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.000
 need to understand well and to get a 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.490
 then the image is of higher quality than 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.030
 raw material 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.170
 almost impossible 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.220
 annu knowing some 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.800
 rules of perception 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.620
 human image 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.690
 what can be improved 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.600
 in the sect of that pictures need a boost 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.730
 sharpness 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.990
 while actually only rising 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.350
 local contrasts on contours 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.470
 Images 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.840
 why the new one becomes visually 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.240
 clearer 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.659
 so now go directly to 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.980
 the work of doubt regulatory 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.410
 the first one is the value framework she 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.510
 determine how strong he will be 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.670
 increased contrast however contours about 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.710
 pick up my wife 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.920
 accordingly, the higher the value given 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.579
 regulator the more will be 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.239
 contrast transition the next parameter 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.489
 this is the radius it affects the width of the contour act 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 which will increase the contrast 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.669
 and if we increase it 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:25.849
 who will increase 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.859
 rarity whole but milwaukee details 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.639
 images will be 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.779
 stop county 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.299
 so if you have a very 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.719
 many small parts then use this 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.549
 tool more carefully so on 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.039
 the details 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.599
 ao manage butt suit 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.639
 high frequency components snapshot 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.369
 accordingly increase 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.379
 values ​​reduce artifacts 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.859
 for example in voices and more 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.049
 and other small details 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.589
 who are in the picture 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.469
 and the last tool is 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.909
 masking 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.010
 it allows you to set the minimum difference in 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.969
 contrast 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.349
 at which it will be 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.480
 increase applied 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.549
 responsibility 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.900
 increase the value of this parameter 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.099
 avoids gain 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.249
 undesirable vitali 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.709
 for example, the amount of occupation or 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.600
 as an invoice 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.449
 human skin 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.139
 so now let's see how it all 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.719
 are working 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.779
 on practice 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.349
 but first 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.449
 and you need to zoom 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.320
 Images 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.309
 up to one hundred percent 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.029
 but in this case, not one to three 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.029
 maybe even make it 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.279
 one to one 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.679
 in particular up to one hundred percent a year in what 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.369
 the problem is the image staff the better 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.729
 it will be seen 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.339
 how this tool works 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.159
 so first increased the value 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.120
 to the maximum value 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.079
 like this 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.509
 further and by selection of the radius we look 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.200
 to analyze the lesion 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.939
 see already appeared 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.950
 what made 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.530
 that is, the more they will not increase 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.959
 radius the greater will be such grains from 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.939
 network 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.059
 happens on the image of the arrow and 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.779
 what we got after applying 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.680
 rarity tools 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 so on work on the details 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.650
 lovers get involved like better yes 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.469
 so we already have media sticks stop 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.009
 at first 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.009
 I will now interfere with the radius 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.389
 so what will happen see 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.240
 on contour 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.419
 to transitions 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.249
 what happens when 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.289
 there, too, can make the area smaller 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.259
 for example 1 5 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.569
 here it is 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.759
 there is and now try to apply 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 already masking options 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.469
 too much use can not be so 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.189
 as you can see what happens 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.400
 so you will need to look 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.779
 middle ground 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.759
 at which there will be good stretches 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.080
 project 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.900
 the image will be 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.229
 to look like 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.699
 sharper 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.729
 so let's get bills and grams given 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.029
 tool 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.190
 let's see how you can 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.960
 achieve more 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.069
 good quality sharpness 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.069
 so born probably still connect 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.069
 science and culture images 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.779
 production we received 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.199
 on the spot now the news is m original 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.309
 scales 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.089
 look at the right picture 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.619
 after using this tool 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.749
 rubles 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:01.119
 much sharper but attracting 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.819
 see that 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.449
 there is such a big grain 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.099
 now you will be homework 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.860
 and you believe at least five of your shots 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.270
 but 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.270
 without which we would like 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.300
 improve 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.500
 using this tool 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.070
 try to bring 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.330
 yes not that they looked 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.800
 as sharp as possible 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.449
 at the same time remember that the sharpness of the image 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.319
 this is a subjective parameter 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.659
 which depends 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.659
 from a large number of factors 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.630
 and even the same image on 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.990
 liquid crystal 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.360
 the monitor screen can extend quite by 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.250
 to another 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.000
 than for example on the monitor which 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.939
 has an electron beam tube 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.819
 but usually printing is required 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.539
 greatest sharpening 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.779
 than for viewing on screens 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.989
 however, when setting up a rare sector 

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:57.229
 detail panels 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.879
 navigate the screen because 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.379
 lightroom program allows 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.639
 additionally increase sharply snapshot 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.309
 when sending print 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.270
 if when exporting 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.360
 on your images 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.789
 so dear viewers and today 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.979
 our kind of sharpening lessons 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.009
 your families came to an end 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.889
 the next video tutorials we will talk about how 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.240
 suppress what he 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.159
 Navajino lesions 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.119
 do your homework and see you 

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:29.460
 The following video lessons with you was Leonid 

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.989
 laundryman
