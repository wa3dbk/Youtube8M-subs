across 12 chapters which each bring you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.040 
across 12 chapters which each bring you
a<00:02:19.680> new<00:02:19.950> ability<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.120> most<00:02:21.330> levels<00:02:21.660> break<00:02:21.870> down

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050

a new ability so most levels break down
like<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.590> you're<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> horizontal

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
like this so you're on a horizontal

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.280 
like this so you're on a horizontal
plane<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.030> you'll<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.570> presented<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.080> two

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
plane and you'll be presented with two

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.620 
plane and you'll be presented with two
or<00:02:25.769> three<00:02:25.800> jumps<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:27.209> repercussions

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630

for<00:02:28.140> failure<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.519> jump<00:02:29.760> too<00:02:29.910> soon<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
for failure so if you jump too soon you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.539 
for failure so if you jump too soon you
might<00:02:30.690> hit<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> wall<00:02:31.110> or<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.350> jagged<00:02:31.739> rock<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.190> you

might hit a wall or a jagged rock if you

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.890 
might hit a wall or a jagged rock if you
jump<00:02:32.790> too<00:02:32.910> early<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.390> you'll<00:02:33.540> collide

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
jump too early and you'll collide

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.630 
jump too early and you'll collide
address<00:02:34.530> you'll<00:02:34.739> be<00:02:34.829> jumping<00:02:35.040> through<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.400> tire
