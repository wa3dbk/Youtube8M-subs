00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 dynamic how are you the teacher jesÃºs 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:10.770
 slim waving and sharing 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.990
 and the aquatic system that builds here 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.090
 at home a couple of weeks ago 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.070
 and I'm watching these plants look 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.660
 how can you here observe the this is 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 a lettuce plant looks 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.439
 you see that it is growing it has already grown 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.690
 quite here is a cucumber that for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.470
 some reason has not grown 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 and it seems that it has something of 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.570
 plague here I have a basil plant 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.010
 also that the suckers are already coming out 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 from below another plant of lettuce and is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.210
 look there is the root 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.920
 the root is there 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 growing quite a lot here we have that more 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.850
 we have here this is another plant 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.399
 cucumbers 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.520
 and it was also just all the roots 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.100
 what do you have then for some reason 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.030
 I do not know what the reason is 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.380
 plant is growing more than that 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 up here has another medal this 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.090
 has flower out there is also cucumbers 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.069
 and as you can see its roots is already 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.380
 developing quite this is a 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.729
 chile plant 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.820
 the big court there and the transplant there 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.010
 inside the system 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.390
 and look for you to appreciate the system here 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:45.420
 from afar 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.840
 what built of 3-inch tube had 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840
 to 3 inches 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.950
 it seems to me that this is drainpipe and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.730
 I do not recommend it so much because it's something 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.680
 flexible and you have to have this 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.740
 then put supports for it 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.159
 stop in this case use these 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.379
 brackets there with screws to the wall 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.560
 and well here to look inside the 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.560
 system 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.600
 I put some volcanic rock so that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.630
 the water flows a little more slowly 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.290
 let's see this other template too 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.620
 there go getting relatively to 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.110
 final 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.590
 then the water arrives 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.700
 here 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.260
 the discrete world the water 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.260
 there some fish go 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.569
 sometimes I go country 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.459
 and here is the pump the pump the strawberry 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.410
 I have the pump the hose that 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.110
 the water came up 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.569
 the water came up 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.140
 and in the water 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.140
 flowing 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.040
 now 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.520
 continue to here 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.330
 and so on until you get to 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.210
 to fall again here they are circulating 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.370
 constantly 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.080
 that more than more I have here good 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.530
 Well, I'm not watching the water 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.069
 observing the reaction of the plants and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.490
 these days I'm going to get 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.820
 a kit out there for 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.690
 to measure the chemistry of water by knowing 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.250
 how is the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 the balance of the elements that must 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.630
 have so I'll see each other see you 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.350
 out there once again you friend the teacher 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.440
 jesus slim reporting you from here 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.820
 from my house and learning all the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.380
 days 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.660
 discovering new things about how 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.970
 keep my world 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.720
 something greener than we innovate a hug 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.720
 see you soon
