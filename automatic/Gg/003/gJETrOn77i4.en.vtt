00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.079
 also spent a lot of time stuck in 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.520
 of the vehicle until the arrival of the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.800
 the fire department that provided the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.239

 approximately half an hour to complete 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.570

 sent to the municipal hospital by the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 The fire department has made it difficult 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.299
 was not difficult to withdraw from the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.000
 victim even because it is the mass enough 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.920
 the roof of the vehicle and made it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.509
 How we put what depresses 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 mobilize within the vehicle 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.549
 there when we see that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.850
 improvise and we took the removal of a 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.939
 Another way and thank God, everything with 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.670

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.079
 very reasonable and unfortunately has a 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 of possible fractures in the limb 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.189
 lower left and upper left 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.350
 also we realized at the time of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.470

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 one of their legs and complained 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 Positive legs is he who thought of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.219
 behind the scenes but the leg is not a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.439
 very worrying situation for the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.270
 lifeguard is a key part of the 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.219
 truth ends up being the head in the head 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.469
 ne of the cervical spine region 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.250
 Thank God 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.879
 apparently yes he had already left 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.680
 of the vehicle was out but now 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.129
