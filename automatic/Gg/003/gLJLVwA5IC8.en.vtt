00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 Pope 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.960
 firm balancing here from new york 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.670
 because I have five phones and the s4 will be 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.559
 really difficult 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.530
 we have not prepared anything to activate them 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.210
 all together and to see the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.070
 differences 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.720
 let's see if we can ok it was almost there 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.580
 done 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.390
 obviously they are not set to stay 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.949
 turned on then we speak immediately of 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.010
 polycarbonate plastic materials 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.820
 obviously takes lines and materials 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.559
 ds3 and at night 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.410
 I'll show you the comparison 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.470
 dimensional among the various phones here 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.280
 we have much smaller iphone network 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.489
 also as a display and as materials on 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.070
 not of how many bigger and well valued 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.129
 you look at how much bigger it is 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.939
 I'll show you the NOTW also the part 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.589
 rear 

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:01.580
 wany hicks which is probably the 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.949
 most accredited competitor in size 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.390
 practically very very similar 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.610
 compliments materials verse because we are 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.070
 on polycarbonate while up here at nick 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.710
 we are on aluminum expandable memory e 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.650
 removable battery on s4 while Monday 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.160
 all this up 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.270
 su juan sorry not one hits xperia z 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.100
 inspired slightly larger than the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.750
 display instead is the same 5 inches 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.380
 both full hd 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.950
 but let's see if I can show you one 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 screen unfortunately does not go 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.840
 the data connection on s4 anyway 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.880
 let's go to the homepage randomly 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.740
 we have the same image 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.210
 look at the difference in the displays is a 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.860
 super amoled by full hd against a tft e 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.400
 you see why the viewing angle 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:59.650
 class s4 and perfect while on the sony 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.510
 Slavic colors but back to his knicks 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.340
 look at the difference in the displays 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.030
 unfortunately I don't have the same image here 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.459
 to be made to revise but I can make you 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.810
 see the difference regarding 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.490
 the software 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.500
 here handle all five phones 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.250
 together it is truly an operation of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.620
 balance the difference between 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.940
 task manager manager don't let you go 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.400
 internet because I wanted to show you 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.280
 just the difference between the two phones 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.890
 but I can't not succeed then 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.830
 trust me they are very very similar 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.870
 as for the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.200
 there 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.010
 nothing the speed of use fluidity e 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.270
 the two different philosophies 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.410
 regarding 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 the management of both the home where here 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.780
 we have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 lynnfield while on samsung we have 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.330
 the virtually classic interface of the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.129
 touch wiz we have features 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.650
 interesting regarding ss4 on 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.629
 software but both voted 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.819
 to the infrared port to control the 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.959
 tv through dedicated applications, yes 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.959
 interface with 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.239
 with television programs 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.400
 I would say that more here from New York not 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.580
 I can do because I have a lot of 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.099
 journalists around who are craving 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.140
 my phone so for comparisons 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.140
 I give you an appointment in Milan
