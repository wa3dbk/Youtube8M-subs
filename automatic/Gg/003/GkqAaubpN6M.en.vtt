00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
 hello everyone so here's a little tutorial 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.380
 to mount your hubcaps of you so 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.799
 here are the adapters he would find 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 with the sale of your roof racks with 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.630
 here the anchor points of your bars 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630
 roof 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.529
 so you see it's 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.369
 plastic no his name case with my 3 that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 very well 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.290
 but for a white or other color 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.170
 it's different 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.899
 possible to paint them so for the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:58.289
 dismantling you open righteous pulling you 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:01:00.989
 in strength in you see so there you have 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.589
 the complete rail with the points of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.740
 fixing your hubcaps of you 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:12.110
 for reassembly it's not good 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.110
 complicated to iron 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 be careful to go under the seal of the 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:37.810
 windshield to limit inflation 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:37.810
 town in the rails is not easy 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.130
 dac 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:02:05.900
 so then as everything is fine me 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:07.880
 namely positioning itself to enter 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.560
 to tap a tap is the palm of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.270
 your hand 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.910
 we must also think about east coast 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:21.400
 water points goes up a scotch celebrated the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.400
 claws of the roof bars task peace 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.540
 everything is well fixed and the hubcaps 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.709
 roof are well mounted there is more 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 than open them one of the two sides and 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.490
 mount your roof racks that I 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.170
 would like it written by photo so here 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.170
