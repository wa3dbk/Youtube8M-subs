00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
right through here one to see how

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.950 
right through here one to see how
aggressive<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:36.790> enemy<00:00:37.090> is<00:00:37.239> if<00:00:37.360> i'm<00:00:37.480> not<00:00:37.660> sure

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.980 
I'm hoping someone's on the mounted
again<00:01:43.340> no<00:01:43.520> activity<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.330> keep<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.659> seating

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
again no activity so I keep the seating

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.660 
again no activity so I keep the seating
usually<00:01:45.619> no<00:01:45.800> one's<00:01:45.950> protecting<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.430> back

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
usually no one's protecting this back

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.280 
usually no one's protecting this back
door<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.149> there's<00:01:47.270> always<00:01:47.659> someone<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.170> there

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
door and there's always someone in there

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.330 
door and there's always someone in there
you<00:01:48.409> know<00:01:48.440> there's<00:01:48.890> someone<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.220> there

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
you know there's someone in there

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.160 
you know there's someone in there
usually<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.729> back<00:01:49.909> corner<00:01:50.210> which<00:01:50.930> is

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
usually in the back corner which is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.560 
usually in the back corner which is
where<00:01:51.440> he<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:51.649> right<00:01:51.830> there<00:01:52.180> running<00:01:53.180> or<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
where he is right there running or the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.480 
where he is right there running or the
other<00:01:53.690> bomb<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.409> get<00:01:54.830> kind<00:01:55.040> of<00:01:55.100> lucky<00:01:55.340> there

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
other bomb I get kind of lucky there

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.150 
other bomb I get kind of lucky there
because<00:01:55.670> my<00:01:55.820> accuracy<00:01:56.270> was<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.540> little<00:01:56.810> off<00:01:57.160> and

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
because my accuracy was a little off and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.960 
because my accuracy was a little off and
then<00:01:58.340> we<00:01:58.429> nab<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.759> next<00:01:59.000> guy<00:01:59.179> here<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.970> then

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
then we nab the next guy here and then

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.560 
then we nab the next guy here and then
my<00:02:02.149> teammates<00:02:02.539> finish<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.170> last<00:02:03.350> guy<00:02:03.590> off

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.550 

we're<00:02:08.570> going<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.989> same<00:02:09.019> thing<00:02:09.410> this

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
we're going to do the same thing this

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.020 
we're going to do the same thing this
time<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.070> bomb<00:02:10.280> we're<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.819> rush

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
time I have the bomb we're going to rush

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.400 
time I have the bomb we're going to rush
the<00:02:11.209> exact<00:02:11.540> same<00:02:11.750> way<00:02:11.959> we're<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.319> go

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
the exact same way we're going to go

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.710 
the exact same way we're going to go
quickly<00:02:12.850> underneath<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.030> opening<00:02:14.600> and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
quickly underneath that opening and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.660 
quickly underneath that opening and
we're<00:02:14.810> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.989> go<00:02:15.110> straight<00:02:15.519> toward<00:02:16.519> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
we're going to go straight toward the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.820 
we're going to go straight toward the
bomb<00:02:16.850> site<00:02:17.209> now<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.260> nice<00:02:18.530> thing<00:02:18.769> here

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
bomb site now that's nice thing here

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.940 
bomb site now that's nice thing here
actually<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.760> enemy<00:02:20.090> does

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
actually if the enemy does

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.070 
actually if the enemy does
an<00:02:21.340> air<00:02:21.550> strike<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.150> they're<00:02:22.480> assuming<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
an air strike so they're assuming that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.229 
an air strike so they're assuming that
we're<00:02:23.290> held<00:02:23.620> back<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:24.489> rushing<00:02:24.940> forward

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
we're held back so like rushing forward

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.150 
we're held back so like rushing forward
we<00:02:25.660> actually<00:02:25.840> catch<00:02:26.349> them<00:02:26.620> off<00:02:26.769> guard<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
we actually catch them off guard and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.650 
we actually catch them off guard and
there's<00:02:27.310> no<00:02:27.519> one<00:02:27.670> here<00:02:27.879> everyone<00:02:28.209> rushed<00:02:28.480> they

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
there's no one here everyone rushed they

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.619 
there's no one here everyone rushed they
figure<00:02:28.930> all<00:02:29.050> yeah<00:02:29.230> we've<00:02:29.470> got<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.860> guy<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.330> I

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
figure all yeah we've got this guy so I

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.420 
figure all yeah we've got this guy so I
set<00:02:31.930> up<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.140> claymore<00:02:32.560> here<00:02:32.800> I've<00:02:32.920> got<00:02:33.069> lots<00:02:33.250> of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
set up a claymore here I've got lots of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.190 
set up a claymore here I've got lots of
time<00:02:33.580> they're<00:02:33.790> preoccupied<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.720> next<00:02:34.959> claim

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
time they're preoccupied the next claim

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.830 
time they're preoccupied the next claim
where<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.379> face<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.400> actual<00:02:36.790> bomb<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.569> put

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
where I face the actual bomb and I put

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.680 
where I face the actual bomb and I put
it<00:02:37.930> against<00:02:38.319> this<00:02:38.760> other<00:02:39.760> casing<00:02:40.330> here<00:02:40.510> so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
it against this other casing here so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.910 
it against this other casing here so
it's<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.900> little<00:02:41.050> bit<00:02:41.140> harder<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.470> see<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:41.800> they

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
it's a little bit harder to see if they

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.710 
it's a little bit harder to see if they
approach<00:02:42.220> from<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> other<00:02:42.640> side<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.390> at<00:02:43.510> least

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
approach from the other side so at least

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.509 
approach from the other side so at least
they<00:02:43.930> know<00:02:43.959> they<00:02:44.349> have<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.650> destroy<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.280> if

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
they know they have to destroy it and if

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.039 
they know they have to destroy it and if
they<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> destroy<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.360> all<00:02:46.510> know<00:02:46.780> that

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
they have to destroy it all know that

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.530 
they have to destroy it all know that
they're<00:02:47.200> actually<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.769> bomb<00:02:47.950> target<00:02:48.540> so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
they're actually at the bomb target so

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
they're actually at the bomb target so
I'm<00:02:49.599> going<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.780> swing<00:02:49.989> around<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.349> back

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
I'm going to swing around the back

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.229 
I'm going to swing around the back
usually<00:02:50.980> there's<00:02:51.160> someone<00:02:51.400> around<00:02:51.489> here<00:02:51.910> so

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
usually there's someone around here so

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.850 
usually there's someone around here so
I'm<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.019> try<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.290> nab<00:02:53.590> them<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.360> don't

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
I'm going to try and nab them I don't

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.140 
I'm going to try and nab them I don't
lucky<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:56.890> me<00:02:57.160> someone's<00:02:57.700> trying<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.030> come

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
lucky for me someone's trying to come

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.390 
lucky for me someone's trying to come
out<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.420> first<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.870> which<00:02:59.049> kills<00:02:59.349> them<00:02:59.530> now<00:03:00.370> I

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
out the first one which kills them now I

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.250 
out the first one which kills them now I
know<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:00.910> sort<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.180> stayed<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.660> this<00:03:01.870> area

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
know I can sort of stayed in this area

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.470 
know I can sort of stayed in this area
here<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.739> claymore<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.730> typically<00:03:04.239> going<00:03:04.360> to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
here that claymore is typically going to

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.420 
here that claymore is typically going to
go<00:03:04.599> up<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.049> I'm<00:03:05.230> assuming<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.040> someone's
