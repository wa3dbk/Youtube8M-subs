00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
cool thing about the set is that it's

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.770 
cool thing about the set is that it's
all<00:03:48.800> in<00:03:49.010> one<00:03:49.250> big<00:03:49.670> studio<00:03:50.240> that<00:03:50.510> usually

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
all in one big studio that usually

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.180 
all in one big studio that usually
doesn't<00:03:50.900> have<00:03:51.080> anything<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.800> so<00:03:51.920> all

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
doesn't have anything in it and so all

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.500 
doesn't have anything in it and so all
of<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.459> equipment<00:03:52.670> has<00:03:52.940> moved<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.330> before

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
of this equipment has moved in before

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.940 
of this equipment has moved in before
production<00:03:53.840> started<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.590> created

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
production started and created

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.830 
production started and created
specifically<00:03:55.520> for<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.940> sing-off<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:56.720> this

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
specifically for the sing-off so this

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.300 
specifically for the sing-off so this
might<00:03:57.020> actually<00:03:57.140> be<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.500> most<00:03:57.620> exciting

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
might actually be the most exciting

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.370 
might actually be the most exciting
moment<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.670> any<00:03:58.850> show<00:03:59.090> Davey<00:03:59.420> releasing<00:03:59.810> their

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380
