00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello here is Kathrin Kilian from online 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.069
 - cleaning lady school.de and I want 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.080
 record a short short video today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 on the subject of weather we have to join us 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.040
 weather when we are on the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 Sports boat license to prepare lake 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 but also for the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.529
 sport boat license for the sport 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.390
 see shepherd sparkle and ever 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 Of course, above all things for ours 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.980
 practice at sea we need knowledge 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 to the weather and I'll be short today 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 show what I look at me every morning 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.900
 the weather map to the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 weather information and of course the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.940
 say wind fire and have this 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
 Weather map found on the website 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.320
 weather central.de where I am always 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 inform that will be published by 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.559
 German weather service 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.940
 and we see here the high and low 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:54.180
 low pressure areas over europe on 26 march 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.420
 and here in the middle is here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.250
 Germany and I have seen 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
 Today we have exactly over our region 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.189
 over the ostseekÃ¼ste over roads 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.930
 lie a deep pressure center and have 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.850
 me then sometimes the wind 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.360
 I look at the forecast 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 always on the website win finder.com 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 and look at the predictions for the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.369
 marina stralsund and there we have 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.400
 today for wednesday the 26 march the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.100
 The wind turns from the west over 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.780
 south on eastern directions and that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.420
 whole within a very short time 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 show within half a day 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 I therefore once see how fast you 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 even if it can change how fast 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.520
 the wind direction completely around 180 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.650
 can rotate 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.930
 What we mainly do when planning your trip 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.580
 if we are in one 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.140
 should want to sail certain direction 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.890
 Just let us know about it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.360
 inform if we are with wind 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 changes in direction are expected and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 Of course you should also know how strong 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.750
 The wind will be mine today 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.120
 but especially about the wind direction we 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.860
 So first wind from west then south 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.020
 then east and we look to times 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.750
 again briefly the low pressure area to us 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.030
 have learned the lesson in the wind 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.950
 in low pressure areas always turns around 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 around the center opposite the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.980
 clockwise that would be in this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.310
 direction so turned the wind 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.860
 around the low pressure area turn around that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.160
 is called below the core so south 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.950
 of the core we have westwind east of the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.390
 We have south wind and gravure kernels 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.830
 north of the low pressure we have 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.170
 East wind now says the wind is there 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.870
 we have a wind ahead 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.470
 change direction from west to south 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.230
 rust it means we have so only in the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.220
 west then south wants then in east wind 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.459
 that would mean that this 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.720
 low pressure area from northeast to southwest 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.850
 would have to pull this wind 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.709
 in fact, this wind enters 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.540
 changes and that got me a bit 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.090
 Dirty because we actually 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.920
 the weather is always used to it 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.299
 west comes from the north sea yes from 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.209
 atlanticism so always the 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.989
 low pressure areas mostly from west to 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.540
 pull east 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.400
 Here it should actually be the other way 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.610
 That's why I have some 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.239
 hours later the map is the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.310
 looked at and then we had this 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.080
 situation as you can see that very nicely 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.080
 deep pressure area is actually further 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.500
 hiked 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.480
 from north east direction southwest so that 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.680
 suits the wind prediction we have 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.420
 Here was the region OstseekÃ¼ste 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.890
 turnip road and you can do that on this 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.840
 cards are not really recognizable 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.660
 must be here before all things to the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.760
 the meridians and the broad ones 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.170
 orientate circles then you will find very 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 quickly his own region 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.230
 but you are above all else 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.510
 let's show that 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
 low pressure areas are not always from the west 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.340
 to the east sense but also in times 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.990
 other directions can shift and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.670
 that we see again very nice here 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.290
 that could actually be the wind 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.690
 the wind direction very very fast 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.750
 can change if we look exactly in the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.750
 center of a low pressure area
