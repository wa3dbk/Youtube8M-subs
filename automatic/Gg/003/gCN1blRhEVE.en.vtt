 good dental visit good morning I do 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.230
 illuminate here 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.149

 I open well here ok here we are in 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.500
 matching the wisdom tooth 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.510
 so we will have to do an orthopantomography 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.149
 so that we have a vision 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.489
 overall we will then perform 2 radiographs 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.920
 baiting to verify that it is not there 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.920
 caries between one tooth and another an examination 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.220
 clinical goal is to look at it 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 mouth and then we will also make an assessment 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.030
 periodontal I remove that 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.539
 rebecchini we wear a white coat 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.200
 protective and position to perform 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:23.180
 the tom pan garden please 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.610
 come forward straight back open string 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.299
 this support between the teeth 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.720
 look straight ahead and go to position the 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.250
 perfect light 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.360
 I squeeze the nape of my neck so we perform 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.360
 the tomography fan vegetable garden 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.939
 and slipped 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.420
 and the face of bringing study together 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.010
 from the overview we see the annoyance 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 It is caused by the wisdom tooth more 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.260
 rare occurrence we also have presence 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:15.790
 of a deaf person we also observe up 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.430
 a tooth in the lower arch 37 a 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.910
 caries deep enough we'll go then to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.709
 check it with X-rays 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.900
 specifications please gentlemen nassirya comfortable 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.520
 again we will perform 2 radiographs 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.520
 caries control biking 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.450
 these radiographs will allow us to 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.370
 verify that between one tooth the other 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.230
 therefore in the proximal inter spaces not 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.010
 let there be cavities open and close me 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.440
 it must gently tighten very well 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.440
 perfect we use this centered king 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:00.590
 and get out of here is so perfect and 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.450
 while we await the development that they are 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.020
 digital radiographs 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.730
 we continue the objective clinical examination 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.260
 we verify that there is no cavity a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.060
 crucial level then on the face 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.330
 wall chewing 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.130
 vestibular ie towards the cheek and 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.890
 towards the tongue from the clinical examination 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.890
 objective does not turn out to be processes 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.250
 dear xi we now evaluate the periodontium 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.020
 ie the supporting tissues of the tooth and 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.690
 we evaluate using a probe 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.910
 periodontal that is millimetric and there 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.910
 allows to evaluate if we have some 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.920
 dental pockets you see that the probe does not 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.050
 penetrates more than a millimeter 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.960
 which means we don't have any 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.780
 gum pockets we perform now 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.820
 an inspection a visit of the woven ways 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.420
 to verify that there are not any 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.420
 large open lesions remove the tongue 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.790
 at the level of the floor of the mouth not 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.790
 we have nothing 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.849
 the patient has no lesions 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.260
 therefore it presents an oral cavity in excellent 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.250
 health 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.120
 now open my mouth 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.949
 ok perfectly closes it is not highlighted 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.960
 no click any articulate 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.530
 deviation in opening and closing of 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.210
 mouth and this is an indication that everything is healthy 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.180
 from radiographs and oral biking 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.150
 we highlight a karioso process a 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.240
 level of the second lower molar of 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.010
 left is a curious process deep 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.550
 which deserves to be treated with 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.320
 urgency will also set the appointment 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.010
 for the extraction of the wisdom tooth 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.669
 and I greet and tend to the deaf 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.320
 for the appointment, have a nice day 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.820
