00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.629 

new<00:00:00.719> satellite<00:00:01.350> images<00:00:01.380> have<00:00:02.070> revealed<00:00:02.460> that

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
new satellite images have revealed that

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.269 
new satellite images have revealed that
almost<00:00:02.850> all<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.300> Greenland's<00:00:04.259> surface<00:00:05.009> ice

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
almost all of Greenland's surface ice

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.540 
almost all of Greenland's surface ice
has<00:00:05.580> suddenly<00:00:06.089> started<00:00:06.480> melting<00:00:07.010> as<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.370> can

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
has suddenly started melting as you can

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.240 
has suddenly started melting as you can
see<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.059> just<00:00:09.630> four<00:00:10.019> days<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.679> area<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> where

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
see in just four days the area of where

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.030 
see in just four days the area of where
the<00:00:11.340> ice<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.670> melting<00:00:12.000> has<00:00:12.090> gone<00:00:12.360> from<00:00:12.830> 40%<00:00:13.830> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the ice is melting has gone from 40% of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.470 
the ice is melting has gone from 40% of
the<00:00:14.610> ice<00:00:14.759> sheet<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:16.070> 97<00:00:17.070> percent<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:18.210> change

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the ice sheet to 97 percent the change

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300 
the ice sheet to 97 percent the change
was<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.840> dramatic<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.470> scientists<00:00:20.070> thought

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
was so dramatic that scientists thought

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.550 
was so dramatic that scientists thought
that<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:20.910> must<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.180> made<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> mistake<00:00:21.570> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that they must have made a mistake this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
that they must have made a mistake this
scale<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.340> melting<00:00:23.730> ice<00:00:23.850> hasn't<00:00:24.210> been<00:00:24.359> seen

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
scale of melting ice hasn't been seen

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.880 
scale of melting ice hasn't been seen
since<00:00:25.460> 1889<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.029> what's<00:00:27.420> causing<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.439> let's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
since 1889 so what's causing this let's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
since 1889 so what's causing this let's
go<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> NASA<00:00:29.460> scientist<00:00:30.000> Thomas<00:00:30.240> Wagner<00:00:30.510> who's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
go to NASA scientist Thomas Wagner who's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.860 
go to NASA scientist Thomas Wagner who's
in<00:00:31.430> Washington<00:00:32.430> DC<00:00:32.700> mr.<00:00:33.180> Wagner<00:00:33.480> what's<00:00:33.630> going

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
in Washington DC mr. Wagner what's going

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.340 
in Washington DC mr. Wagner what's going
on<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:35.120> yeah<00:00:36.120> what's<00:00:36.450> happening<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.170> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
on here yeah what's happening is this we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
on here yeah what's happening is this we
had<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.680> anomalous<00:00:38.280> weather<00:00:38.489> system

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
had a really anomalous weather system

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610 
had a really anomalous weather system
develop<00:00:39.360> over<00:00:39.570> Greenland<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.050> year<00:00:40.350> which

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
develop over Greenland this year which

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.410 
develop over Greenland this year which
caused<00:00:40.920> an<00:00:41.100> unprecedented<00:00:41.910> amount<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
caused an unprecedented amount of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
caused an unprecedented amount of
melting<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.649> perspective

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
melting and to put this in perspective

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
melting and to put this in perspective
the<00:00:44.670> Greenland<00:00:45.059> ice<00:00:45.120> sheet<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> miles<00:00:45.809> thick

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the Greenland ice sheet is miles thick

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900 
the Greenland ice sheet is miles thick
and<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.010> high<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> middle

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and it's very very high up in the middle

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340 
and it's very very high up in the middle
think<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> being<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> mountain

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
think of being up on top of a mountain

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619 
think of being up on top of a mountain
it's<00:00:50.070> usually<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.640> cold<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.360> year

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it's usually really cold but this year

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.299 
it's usually really cold but this year
got<00:00:51.840> warm<00:00:52.079> enough<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> melt<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.190> way

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
got warm enough to melt all the way

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.150 
got warm enough to melt all the way
across<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> surprise<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.860> mean

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
across it and is this a surprise I mean

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.549 
across it and is this a surprise I mean
how<00:00:56.280> could<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:57.210> known<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> all

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
how could you have not known if you all

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.540 
how could you have not known if you all
over<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.980> satellite<00:00:59.190> images<00:01:01.340> well<00:01:02.340> what

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
over the satellite images well what

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.680 
over the satellite images well what
happened<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.510> people

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
happened was this was that people

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
happened was this was that people
started<00:01:04.140> noticing<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> anomalous<00:01:05.129> weather

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
started noticing the anomalous weather

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
started noticing the anomalous weather
around<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> coastal<00:01:06.270> areas<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.380> do

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
around the coastal areas but what we do

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
around the coastal areas but what we do
is<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.040> can't<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> melt<00:01:09.210> necessarily

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
is you can't see the melt necessarily

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.240 
is you can't see the melt necessarily
you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.080> almost<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you can almost think of it like if you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
you can almost think of it like if you
looked<00:01:11.520> over<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.909> places<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.570> be

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
looked over these places they would be

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.120 
looked over these places they would be
covered<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.140> snow<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.770> there's<00:01:13.920> actually

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
covered with snow but there's actually

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.300 
covered with snow but there's actually
no<00:01:14.970> water<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> snow<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.320> ice<00:01:16.560> now

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
no water in that snow it's all ice now

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.649 
no water in that snow it's all ice now
we're<00:01:17.549> knowing<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> water<00:01:18.509> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
we're knowing that there was water in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
we're knowing that there was water in
between<00:01:19.049> those<00:01:19.229> snow<00:01:19.470> particles<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
between those snow particles but that's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100 
between those snow particles but that's
just<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> upper<00:01:21.330> after<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> upper

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
just that the upper after the upper

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
just that the upper after the upper
reaches<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> lower<00:01:22.860> reaches<00:01:23.310> there's<00:01:23.520> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
reaches at the lower reaches there's so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
reaches at the lower reaches there's so
much<00:01:23.880> melt<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.299> forming<00:01:24.600> rivers<00:01:24.900> ponds

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
much melt that's forming rivers ponds

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
much melt that's forming rivers ponds
and<00:01:25.380> lakes<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.100> even<00:01:26.310> washing<00:01:26.700> out

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and lakes and it's even washing out

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
and lakes and it's even washing out
bridges<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.390> summer<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.170> something

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
bridges this summer is this something

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.100 
bridges this summer is this something
that's<00:01:29.100> likely<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.610> continue<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:30.960> sort

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that's likely to continue and what sort

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.469 
that's likely to continue and what sort
of<00:01:31.140> impact<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.759> sea<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
of impact will it have on the sea the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.980 
of impact will it have on the sea the
environment<00:01:35.090> well<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> big<00:01:36.390> deal<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.570> visit

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
environment well the big deal is visit

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
environment well the big deal is visit
and<00:01:37.170> again<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.860> shouldn't<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.340> lost

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and again this shouldn't get lost

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
and again this shouldn't get lost
Greenland<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.810> losing<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> tremendous<00:01:40.710> amount

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
Greenland is losing a tremendous amount

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
Greenland is losing a tremendous amount
of<00:01:41.070> ice<00:01:41.189> globally<00:01:41.790> sea<00:01:42.000> levels<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.479> rising

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
of ice globally sea levels are rising

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270 
of ice globally sea levels are rising
about<00:01:42.990> three<00:01:43.229> millimeters<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.770> year<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.220> at

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
about three millimeters a year and at

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920 
about three millimeters a year and at
least<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> half<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.880> millimeter<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.570> just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
least a half a millimeter that just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
least a half a millimeter that just
comes<00:01:46.170> from<00:01:46.350> Greenland<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.490> probably

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
comes from Greenland and that's probably

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
comes from Greenland and that's probably
caused<00:01:48.149> by<00:01:48.180> ocean<00:01:48.720> warming<00:01:49.110> around<00:01:49.409> Greenland

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
caused by ocean warming around Greenland

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
caused by ocean warming around Greenland
causing<00:01:50.189> increased<00:01:50.549> calving<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.390> melt

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
causing increased calving and also melt

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
causing increased calving and also melt
this<00:01:52.560> event<00:01:53.070> though<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.909> surface

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this event though is just the surface

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.940 
this event though is just the surface
layer<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.990> covers<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.829> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
layer and it covers all of it and we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
layer and it covers all of it and we
think<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> probably<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.450> within

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
think that this probably is within

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
think that this probably is within
natural<00:01:58.380> variation<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.399> point<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
natural variation at this point of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
natural variation at this point of
course<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.329> happens<00:02:00.659> again<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:01.200> happens

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
course if it happens again or happens

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.870 
course if it happens again or happens
repeatedly<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:02.280> we'd<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.610> cause<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
repeatedly then we'd have cause to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
repeatedly then we'd have cause to
really<00:02:03.299> worry<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.750> isn't<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.140> something

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
really worry but isn't this something

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.410 
really worry but isn't this something
that<00:02:04.619> happens<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.310> average<00:02:05.670> every<00:02:05.939> 150<00:02:06.840> years

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
that happens on average every 150 years

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
that happens on average every 150 years
sure<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.200> why<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.649> were<00:02:10.800> pretty

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
sure it is and that's why we were pretty

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.970 
sure it is and that's why we were pretty
careful<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.550> way<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.849> we<00:02:11.940> described<00:02:12.330> this

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
careful the way that we described this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.259 
careful the way that we described this
really<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:13.730> within<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.060> natural

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
really be just within the natural

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.970 
really be just within the natural
variation<00:02:14.750> again<00:02:15.409> there<00:02:15.590> was<00:02:15.680> some<00:02:15.830> really

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
variation again there was some really

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.800 
variation again there was some really
anomalous<00:02:16.550> weather<00:02:16.760> patterns<00:02:17.239> this<00:02:17.480> year

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
anomalous weather patterns this year

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
anomalous weather patterns this year
there<00:02:18.200> was<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.349> higher<00:02:18.590> pressure<00:02:18.890> system<00:02:19.340> over

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
there was a higher pressure system over

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.399 
there was a higher pressure system over
Iceland<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.090> there<00:02:20.180> was<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.299> lot<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.569> just<00:02:20.989> warm

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
Iceland and there was a lot of just warm

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.930 
Iceland and there was a lot of just warm
air<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.799> wound<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.190> over<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.489> Greenland<00:02:22.849> ice

Iceland's neighbors sorry Greenland's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.460 
Iceland's neighbors sorry Greenland's
neighbors<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:28.819> getting<00:02:29.569> concerned<00:02:30.019> can<00:02:30.319> this

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
neighbors be getting concerned can this

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.530 
neighbors be getting concerned can this
have<00:02:30.890> quite<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> dramatic<00:02:31.430> impact<00:02:31.879> on<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> way

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
have quite a dramatic impact on the way

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.400 
have quite a dramatic impact on the way
they<00:02:32.720> live<00:02:33.790> well<00:02:34.790> probably<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.959> because<00:02:36.200> we

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
they live well probably not because we

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.259 
they live well probably not because we
think<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:36.890> again<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.849> know<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:38.180> in

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
think this is again you know think in

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.330 
think this is again you know think in
the<00:02:38.360> 1930s<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.379> u.s.<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:39.769> got<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.099> warm

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the 1930s in the u.s. that got so warm

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.920 
the 1930s in the u.s. that got so warm
there<00:02:40.549> were<00:02:40.640> dust<00:02:40.879> balls<00:02:41.090> across<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.599> country

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
there were dust balls across the country

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.680 
there were dust balls across the country
you<00:02:42.110> know<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.530> fact<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.159> weather<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.000> climate

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
you know the fact is weather and climate

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.500 
you know the fact is weather and climate
they<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:45.980> are<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> lot<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.760> changes<00:02:47.269> that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
they there are a lot of changes that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.600 
they there are a lot of changes that
happen<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.140> short<00:02:48.410> term<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.340> what<00:02:49.489> we

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
happen in the short term but what we

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.890 
happen in the short term but what we
talk<00:02:49.790> about<00:02:49.940> really<00:02:50.239> with<00:02:50.360> climate<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
talk about really with climate is the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
talk about really with climate is the
long-term<00:02:51.049> change<00:02:51.890> long-term<00:02:52.790> though<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
long-term change long-term though it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.819 
long-term change long-term though it
does<00:02:53.329> look<00:02:53.629> like<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.959> earth<00:02:54.049> polar<00:02:54.379> regions

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
does look like the earth polar regions

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.559 
does look like the earth polar regions
are<00:02:55.040> warming<00:02:55.549> up<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.299> this<00:02:56.510> one

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
are warming up it's just that this one

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.110 
are warming up it's just that this one
event<00:02:57.140> may<00:02:57.859> not<00:02:58.069> be<00:02:58.190> associated<00:02:58.489> with<00:02:58.970> that

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
event may not be associated with that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.180 
event may not be associated with that
