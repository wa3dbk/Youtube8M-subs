00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.950
 the kitchen easy my name is sam lee and 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.500
 today we are going to prepare a rich 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.390
 Mexican dish that is very popular in 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.310
 the north of the country especially in 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.920
 monterrey and in coahuila which is the place 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.230
 where I was born is called di scala and it's 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.420
 super easy to make and very delicious the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.600
 Preparation is more or less than 15 minutes 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.270
 and the cooking time is between 25 and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.990
 30 minutes I hope this recipe is 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.390
 extra degrees let's start 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.570
 The ingredients for this recipe are 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.490
 a pound of ground beef usually 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 the dial is made with a combination 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.470
 of pork and beef but I 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.870
 I'm going to make it with turkey meat because 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.430
 my husband does not eat red meat but if he 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 prefer you can use a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.560
 combination of beef and pork or 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 one meat or the other can also 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.610
 do with chicken or like I can 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 use turkey in any way is going to 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.220
 to be delicious we also need two 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.659
 ham cups two sausage cups 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.630
 of those that are used to hard ok 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.729
 5 ounces of chorizo ​​make sure to use a 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.710
 chorizo of good quality because the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 chorizo ​​is the most important seasoning 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 in this recipe 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 we also need an onion and if 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.770
 Like you can also add a cup 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.229
 of chopped red pepper and two peppers 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.090
 jalapeños also finely chopped in 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.460
 our family we like that the dial 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.409
 just meat, so we avoid 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.090
 add the red pepper and as there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.399
 Many young children also avoid 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.319
 the jalapeño pepper but we always do 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.929
 a very spicy sauce not to miss 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.240
 the jalapeño we also need half 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.400
 cup of tomato puree a spoonful of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.830
 chicken consommé 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.520
 and half a tablespoon a spoonful of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.820
 vegetable oil salt and pepper to taste 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.100
 to serve we need tortillas a 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.800
 finely chopped onion and cilantro 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.830
 also finely chopped and of course 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.830
 your favorite sauce and lemons let's start 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.350
 cut the sausages in half and 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.740
 then cut them into small pieces 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.740
 reserve for a moment 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.240
 also cut the ham into pieces 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.270
 small ones about the same 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.650
 size than sausages 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.629
 and also reserve the ones for a moment 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.030
 I'm going to cut the onion into strips 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.319
 thin but if you like you can scratch 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.319
 or it can be finely chopped 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.490
 and that's all the preparation now let's go 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.520
 let's cook 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.340
 in a large pan heat half or one 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.320
 teaspoon of vegetable oil adds the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
 Ground beef and it will break well with your 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.200
 spoon so it does not stay in pieces 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.270
 very big 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.239

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.840
 after this add the chorizo ​​and 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.820
 also bankrupt it with your spoon to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.760
 that is breaking down and seasoning in the flesh 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.130
 ground continues cooking over medium heat 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.150
 for three more minutes just for cooking 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.319
 after three minutes add the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.599
 onion and if you are going to add the pepper 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.299

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.970
 together with the onion stir a little and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.680
 cook on medium heat for three minutes or 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.090
 until the onion gets a little 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 soft and transparent 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.730
 Now add the ham and the sausage 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.500

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.570
 hot you can cover the pan with the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.990
 cover if you prefer so that it 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.420

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.230

 half a tablespoon of chicken bouillon in 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.530
 place of salt and after you've 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.350
 added more seasoning mixes again 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.210
 cover with lid and cook for 3 to 5 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.080
 with the rest of the ingredients 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.590
 and that's all, heat the tortillas in 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.870
 the microwave and you're ready to serve 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.880

 minutes more so that the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.870
 tortillas 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.330
 since the tortillas are hot 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.330
 serves the dial over the tortillas 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.270
