00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.780
 Ivan Congratulations winner of this 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:06.160
 twenty-seventh edition of the rally 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.469
 narón that you can tell us about this 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.330
 victory how everything has gone as 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.490
 the opposite and difficult truth in which 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.160
 we did not enjoy anything they were not the first 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.470
 moments as a shock absorber if we 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.929
 bothered was working what only the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.390
 pier and the truth that the sections were 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:25.210
 with many boats in support and was 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.999
 complicated to drive it not the first stretch 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.099
 we did it very quiet and nothing then 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.769
 we decided that we had to risk this 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.160
 rally was important for the championship 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.660
 and we already put the batteries and nothing 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.940
 we try to run as much as possible 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.370
 within the circumstances of how 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.329
 the car was not and a very rally 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.640
 special where I debuted in 2007 where 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.100
 I debuted with Alvaro and for me this is the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.670
 home rally rally of house 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.920
 bathrooms 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.570
 and nothing very happy is a victory 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.249
 special also we see that those 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.780
 suspension problems 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.579
 shock absorbers do not prepare you to mark 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.109
 scales throughout the day yes man and 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.120
 Pedro is also adapting the car 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.460
 but and he takes it easy but a 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.460
 how much does the batteries put a little 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.420
 career to talk 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.040
 we talked in the botafumeiro of upcoming 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.900
 wax appointments of the championship of spain 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.110
 we already have some date that you can 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.150
 say if we're almost sure yanes that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.460
 it's the idea we're not going after the salary 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.590
 county which is another coincidental rally 8 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.450
 very important and if we manage to finish 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.850
 and that everything goes well and we're going to start 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.250
 think about those careers not now we're 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.960
 focused on the championship and for not 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.390
 want to do more things to see if we're going to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.580
 bother everything but but already in mind 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.200
 be in hyannis and santander in fact 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.670
 after the county salary rally 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
 as they are in the real and of sharon a 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.170
 Regional rally from Cantabria that coincides 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.940
 in stages with the Santander rally and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.220
 mostar to prepare the tests of 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.630
 santander and ians good so they remain 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.950
 well prepared and in subsequent tests 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.650
 from Galician we are taken many 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.600
 thanks very much thanks to you 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.280
 we have with us the pedro burgos 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.410
 second classified this twentieth 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.480
 seventh edition of the reality of won 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.000
 I believe that a good result finally 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.560
 I got to show this for 73 2010 to goal 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.540
 true yes good finally 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.240
 we ended a race not that long ago 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.850
 between last year that not the few 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.520
 15,000 do not finish them and this year that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.140
 it seemed that it twisted a little bit at last 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.720
 we reached the goal we finished the rally 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.250
 seconds that is not not bad not 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.470
 just as the day was and our little 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.480
 experience in this car for the truth 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.150
 that is not a result that I consider 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.160
 well we did not do some more time or 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.140
 less curious and is what you have to take out 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.060
 from today's positive not two scratch at 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.530
 end of the day and well I do not think it was 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.870
 so little optimal optimal terrain for 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.910
 this porsche next wax tests 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.220
 from Galician where we are going to see you good 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.870
 now in hours and then we'll see a 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.840
 small break and we'll see to see where 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.750
 let's be now let's go ourense 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.340
 and then it will depend on the budget that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.720
 more careers we can do that 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.879
 let's make the bierzo and then the san 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.470
 froilán and some more of Galician very 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.690
 well, there, surely, they do not open 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.030
 enjoying a little more of the porch a 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.250
 radio a little more adapted for these 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.019
 good heads yes sure yes despite 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.340
 which is a rally that with the minimum of 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.830
 It's been so long since I did not know what a hat I do not know 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.510
 very good how it is but good for sure 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.340
 if it's not raining and peter and it's another day or 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.959
 less good sure it will be for 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.120
 enjoy more with this type of cars 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.440
 to enjoy and to continue making us 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.069

 Castro Congratulations Finally I'm afraid 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.370
 raised on the podium of this Galician 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.780
 you were waiting for this result 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.700
 true 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.680
 thank you folios but the real ones 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.579
 we need to go three lanes 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.219
 that always trying but never 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.870
 we got good seconds from 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.719
 championship started and if this test 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.159
 seconds of the championship you finish I do not know if 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.419
 was your aspiration now now 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.180
 you go for this subchampionship and 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.099
 covers not why but subchampionship 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.049
 we know why Albert 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.269
 meira run again or that pedro burgo 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.099
 or anything of those us to 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.500
 those pilots those cars we give faith in 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.480
 your forehead targets us pirelli the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.489
 group n if you do not add two things so 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.930
 least know if one can be good 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.970
 little by little we are finding each other 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.739
 with strong as how this result does not 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.329
 yes, yes, it is true that you have to be 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.860
 constant and the truth that we had a lot 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.990
 regularity only that one always missed 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.900
 a few days for a few things or three days for 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.880
 another for example 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.620
 on the line we do not start with turbo 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.600
 give us to the size where we have 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.060
 run like the other cars study 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.250
 santiago that I think I could have seen 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.940
 a podium we sit at 52 good 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.030
 today the result came something that they will add 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.130
 happy as they are, we will be 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.570
 pending of mishaps in the internal 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.960
 of Galician and thank you very much thanks to 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.960
 your
