together which I also appreciate

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.800 
together which I also appreciate
sometimes<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.129> can<00:02:54.340> be<00:02:54.370> hard<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.879> blend<00:02:55.480> things

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
sometimes it can be hard to blend things

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.369 
sometimes it can be hard to blend things
together<00:02:56.140> depending<00:02:56.590> on<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.129> formula<00:02:58.379> what

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
together depending on the formula what

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.589 
together depending on the formula what
else<00:02:59.500> do<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.709> want<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.920> say<00:03:00.099> about<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.489> no<00:03:01.359> it's

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599

good<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.440> only<00:03:02.970> downside<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.269> is<00:03:04.329> it

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
good I the only downside to this is it

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.740 
good I the only downside to this is it
doesn't<00:03:04.930> come<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.890> full<00:03:06.700> range<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.150> Shh<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
doesn't come in a full range of Shh the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.110 
doesn't come in a full range of Shh the
way<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.349> regular<00:03:08.739> powdered<00:03:09.220> bareminerals

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
way the regular powdered bareminerals

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.229 
way the regular powdered bareminerals
does<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:12.489> be<00:03:12.609> honest<00:03:12.819> with<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.030> this

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
does and to be honest with you this

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.349 
does and to be honest with you this
probably<00:03:13.599> isn't<00:03:13.840> exactly<00:03:14.560> my<00:03:14.859> color<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:16.180> if

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
probably isn't exactly my color like if

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.479 
probably isn't exactly my color like if
you<00:03:16.540> know<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.410> can't<00:03:17.739> really<00:03:17.829> tell<00:03:18.099> miss<00:03:18.280> light

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
you know I can't really tell miss light

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.879 
you know I can't really tell miss light
but<00:03:18.819> it's<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.599> little<00:03:19.959> light<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:20.470> me<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.829> I

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
but it's a little light for me and I

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.710 
but it's a little light for me and I
usually<00:03:21.069> wear<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.459> fairly<00:03:22.000> light<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.569> is

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
usually wear a fairly light and this is

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.360 
usually wear a fairly light and this is
fairly<00:03:22.900> medium<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.859> colors<00:03:24.040> aren't

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
fairly medium so the colors aren't

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.539 
fairly medium so the colors aren't
exactly<00:03:24.910> spot-on<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.620> there<00:03:27.220> aren't<00:03:27.400> as<00:03:27.519> many

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
exactly spot-on and there aren't as many

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.849 
exactly spot-on and there aren't as many
of<00:03:27.849> them<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.150> choose<00:03:28.180> from<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:28.900> if<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.650> can

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859
