a wide range of different things

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.940 
a wide range of different things
involving<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.689> ECC's<00:00:26.170> so<00:00:26.439> this<00:00:26.590> is<00:00:26.740> going<00:00:26.890> to

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
involving the ECC's so this is going to

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.429 
involving the ECC's so this is going to
have<00:00:27.070> some<00:00:27.279> stuff<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.840> beginners<00:00:29.140> out

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439

there maybe you just started ECC or

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.350 
there maybe you just started ECC or
you've<00:00:32.529> just<00:00:32.860> starting<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.640> get<00:00:33.790> into<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:34.060> or

mess with sound recorders or maybe you
haven't<00:00:43.450> messed<00:00:43.720> with<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.140> pr3<00:00:44.710> or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
haven't messed with the pr3 or

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.060 
haven't messed with the pr3 or
programming<00:00:46.870> different<00:00:47.140> CV<00:00:47.410> values<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.920> get

programming different CV values to get

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.310 
programming different CV values to get
your<00:00:48.310> operation<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:48.970> work<00:00:49.060> differently<00:00:49.480> so

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
your operation and work differently so

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.960 
your operation and work differently so
we're<00:00:50.770> gonna<00:00:50.860> start<00:00:51.220> off<00:00:51.340> this<00:00:51.550> series<00:00:51.850> at

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
we're gonna start off this series at

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.840 
we're gonna start off this series at
some<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.240> the<00:00:52.330> basics<00:00:52.830> and<00:00:53.830> we're<00:00:54.550> going<00:00:54.790> to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
some of the basics and we're going to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.890 
some of the basics and we're going to
build<00:00:55.270> from<00:00:56.200> there<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.740> work<00:00:57.250> our<00:00:57.460> way<00:00:57.490> up<00:00:57.900> so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
build from there and work our way up so

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.690 
build from there and work our way up so
let's<00:00:59.890> get<00:01:00.040> started<00:01:00.310> with<00:01:00.430> some<00:01:00.550> of<00:01:00.580> the

now if anything like I was when I first

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.770 
now if anything like I was when I first
got<00:01:20.860> started<00:01:20.979> in<00:01:21.369> DCC<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:22.030> had<00:01:22.510> some<00:01:22.690> old

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
got started in DCC I had some old

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.960 
got started in DCC I had some old
equipment<00:01:23.110> some<00:01:24.010> of<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.190> was<00:01:24.280> older<00:01:24.549> Athens

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
equipment some of it was older Athens

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.520 
equipment some of it was older Athens
which<00:01:25.180> made<00:01:25.360> fine<00:01:25.630> candidates<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.229> convert

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
which made fine candidates to convert

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.790 
which made fine candidates to convert
over<00:01:26.560> DCC<00:01:27.190> like<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.210> showed<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.479> my<00:01:28.510> previous

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
over DCC like I showed in my previous

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.640 
over DCC like I showed in my previous
series<00:01:30.090> someone<00:01:31.090> was<00:01:31.210> older<00:01:31.479> Tyco<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
series someone was older Tyco and the

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.490 
series someone was older Tyco and the
older<00:01:32.890> less<00:01:33.100> expensive<00:01:33.580> Bachmann<00:01:34.030> lifelike

that<00:01:35.500> stuff<00:01:35.800> really<00:01:36.070> didn't<00:01:36.460> make<00:01:36.550> a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
that stuff really didn't make a
