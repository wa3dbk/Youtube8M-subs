00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 if you intend in any way 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.279
 work with audiovisual any area 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.259
 Whether you need to know more 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 broadly all technical areas 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.410
 involved in audiovisual language 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:24.180
 equipment of the market of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:26.220
 aesthetics has a very good workload 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 higher than many 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 communication in the area of photography 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.120
 within four years and a key or 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.130
 people are not similar with this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 formatting with this infrastructure 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.829
 available on the market with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 excellent professionals with the help of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.450
 supporting companies, we can have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 a technical park of excellence for 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.969
 to make available to students 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 we have some practical exercises and 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.699
 combining at the end we have a great 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.739
 practical exercise that creates an honor 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.739
 It could be a short video clip 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 the course has views of four modules 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.430
 in these modules they cover principles 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 theory of color theory in the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.729
 of colorimetry or any basis for 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.110
 you understand is how the image fits and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 in this case 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 pulling the digital analogue is not like 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.320
 it forms within the physical theory of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.829
 colors then how's it 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 seen within the sensors as the effort 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.590
 digital or as catar and more 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 with a method available there 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.400
 we have lighting modules 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 so this mode will obviously highlight 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.110
 all the technical park available in the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.409
 market will do practical exercises of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.659
 lighting reflectors wiring the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.420
 principles of electricity temperature 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.350
 color source nature of heights 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.509
 source 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 At that moment the course starts to enter 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.430
 the photographers with their testimonies of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.369
 cases and will dismount with what was 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.229
 made aesthetically technique their point 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.670
 starting with your professional 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.470
 formation 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.200
 very varied in Brazil by our last 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.420
 module that the post-production module 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.980
 not being given as post-production only 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.849
 because you need to know that you have a step 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 post production 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.680
 he is being given that he pulls everything 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.020
 what the photographer must know about 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:34.739
 construction to carry out its 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:39.060
 have a fetish photo camera 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:46.470
 market that rex short clip with 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:48.780
 alexa but goes from head alex to sony 35 10 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.220
 nr also the meeting is one of the things 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.470
 fundamental that I find any course 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.110
 training for people who are 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.260
 together to make a production and the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.970
 relationships they fructify me 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.799
 I recently received a call from 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.840
 boy who was professionalized is a 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.730
 great market lobby that together with 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.590
 another student here has done a job 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.769
 together a professional job 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.269
 they signed me up to say yes to 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.980
 the time we were with all the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.769
 problems of the seven we remember the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.930
 full time of all the tips of all 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.730
 the advice of all the notes of 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.829
 technical solutions if we learn in the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.350
 Thank course accomplishing this 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:29.570
 professional work thanks to the perfect 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.570
 speech with you and on the boat
