today<00:00:11.660> it's<00:00:12.660> me<00:00:12.900> playing<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.620> AAG<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.400> 3<00:00:15.260> with<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
today it's me playing the AAG a 3 with a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.519 
today it's me playing the AAG a 3 with a
smoke<00:00:16.920> launcher<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.080> it's<00:00:19.080> bugged<00:00:19.380> and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
smoke launcher and it's bugged and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.150 
smoke launcher and it's bugged and
basically<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.769> means<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:24.470> if<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
basically what it means is that if you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
basically what it means is that if you
shoot<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.670> grenade<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.390> smoke<00:00:27.960> launcher

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
shoot a grenade with the smoke launcher

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.280 
shoot a grenade with the smoke launcher
when<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.550> mounted<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.489> AAG<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.730> 3<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.719> has

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
when it's mounted on the AAG a 3 it has

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
when it's mounted on the AAG a 3 it has
no<00:00:35.390> low<00:00:36.390> speed<00:00:36.750> loss<00:00:36.989> no<00:00:37.890> drop-off<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
no low speed loss no drop-off so it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.060 
no low speed loss no drop-off so it's
basically<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:42.290> projectile<00:00:43.290> flying<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
basically just projectile flying in a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
basically just projectile flying in a
straight<00:00:44.190> line<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.850> what<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> means<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
straight line and what this means is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.830 
straight line and what this means is
that<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:49.520> basically<00:00:50.520> smite<00:00:51.270> people<00:00:51.690> with

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that you can basically smite people with

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
that you can basically smite people with
this<00:00:52.020> thing<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:55.410> weird<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.550> know

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.459 
yeah that really takes some fun out of
the<00:01:54.179> game<00:01:55.640> fortunately<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:58.200> say

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the game fortunately and I say

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.660 
the game fortunately and I say
fortunately<00:01:58.859> but<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.549> actually

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
fortunately but it's actually

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.419 
fortunately but it's actually
unfortunately<00:02:00.359> but<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:01.469> only<00:02:01.770> works<00:02:02.009> with

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
unfortunately but it only works with

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.719 
unfortunately but it only works with
Diaw<00:02:02.759> gaythri<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.890> doesn't<00:02:05.310> work<00:02:05.429> with<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
Diaw gaythri it doesn't work with the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.740 
Diaw gaythri it doesn't work with the
m16<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:07.409> doesn't<00:02:07.859> work<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.060> AK<00:02:09.470> 74<00:02:10.470> m

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
m16 and it doesn't work with the AK 74 m

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.949 
m16 and it doesn't work with the AK 74 m
so<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.370> doesn't<00:02:14.700> work<00:02:14.849> as<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.780> use<00:02:15.930> it

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
so it also doesn't work as as you use it

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.900 
so it also doesn't work as as you use it
standalone<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.870> seriously<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.760> is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
standalone but seriously this is this is

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.039 
standalone but seriously this is this is
not<00:02:21.090> cool<00:02:21.299> because<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.819> I'm<00:02:24.599> actually<00:02:24.780> afraid

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
not cool because and I'm actually afraid

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.490
