00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.470 

I<00:00:22.349> mean<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.099> great<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.759> be<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I mean it's great to actually be in the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.939 
I mean it's great to actually be in the
real<00:00:24.599> cockpit<00:00:24.990> now<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.169> spent<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.679> much<00:00:25.890> time

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
real cockpit now we spent so much time

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279 
real cockpit now we spent so much time
in<00:00:26.220> simulators<00:00:26.849> over<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> last<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.079> three

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
in simulators over the last two or three

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.490 
in simulators over the last two or three
years<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.189> before<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.910> developing<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
years and before that developing the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.139 
years and before that developing the
cockpit<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
cockpit so to actually now be in the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.630 
cockpit so to actually now be in the
real<00:00:33.269> thing<00:00:33.540> ready<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> fly<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.460> really

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
real thing ready to fly it is is really

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
real thing ready to fly it is is really
exciting<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.629> is<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> primary<00:00:37.110> flight

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
exciting this is the primary flight

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
exciting this is the primary flight
display<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> terms<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.640> flying<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
display so in terms of flying the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.509 
display so in terms of flying the
parameters<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.050> need<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.409> we're<00:00:40.589> needing

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
parameters that we need if we're needing

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.610 
parameters that we need if we're needing
to<00:00:41.610> fly<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.940> 10,000<00:00:42.510> feet<00:00:42.540> 250<00:00:43.140> knots<00:00:43.320> then

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
to fly at 10,000 feet 250 knots then

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
to fly at 10,000 feet 250 knots then
just<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:45.000> normal<00:00:45.390> flying<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.989> would<00:00:46.140> use

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
just as in normal flying we would use

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.719 
just as in normal flying we would use
this<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:46.860> sure<00:00:47.070> we're<00:00:47.220> flying<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
this to make sure we're flying at the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.639 
this to make sure we're flying at the
correct<00:00:48.000> parameters<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
correct parameters this is the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
correct parameters this is the
navigation<00:00:50.040> displayed<00:00:50.640> link<00:00:51.120> very<00:00:51.329> much<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
the flight management system there's a

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.789 
the flight management system there's a
lot<00:00:54.089> of<00:00:54.239> features<00:00:55.199> within<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.619> fight

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
lot of features within the fight

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.249 
lot of features within the fight
management<00:00:56.309> system<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.900> we<00:00:58.019> will<00:00:58.170> be

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:58.259 
management system that we will be

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:59.780 
management system that we will be
getting<00:00:58.559> validating<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.430> much<00:00:59.549> on<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
getting validating not so much on the

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.700 
getting validating not so much on the
very<00:00:59.970> first<00:01:00.239> place<00:01:00.509> that<00:01:00.839> Malaysia<00:01:01.320> provides

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
very first place that Malaysia provides

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.810 
very first place that Malaysia provides
of<00:01:01.860> them<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> cockpit<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.250> basically<00:01:05.670> an

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
of them the cockpit is is basically an

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
of them the cockpit is is basically an
evolution<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.079> 380<00:01:07.530> cockpit<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> was

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
evolution of the 380 cockpit so it was

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.249 
evolution of the 380 cockpit so it was
keep<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> basic<00:01:09.689> philosophy<00:01:10.229> of

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
keep a lot of the basic philosophy of

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.190 
keep a lot of the basic philosophy of
the<00:01:10.680> 320<00:01:11.369> 330<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> display<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.869> primary

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the 320 330 so this display the primary

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.819 
the 320 330 so this display the primary
flight<00:01:13.290> display<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.100> navigation<00:01:14.670> display

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
flight display the navigation display

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.300 
flight display the navigation display
systems<00:01:16.850> warnings<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:19.070> very<00:01:20.070> very

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
systems warnings they are very very

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.740 
systems warnings they are very very
similar<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.180> exists<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
similar to what is it exists in the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.610 
similar to what is it exists in the
other<00:01:21.869> aircraft

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
other aircraft

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.890 
other aircraft
this<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.340> very<00:01:24.520> very<00:01:24.670> similar<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.150> what<00:01:25.750> will

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
this is very very similar to what will

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.810 
this is very very similar to what will
be<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> production<00:01:26.470> cockpit<00:01:27.070> when<00:01:27.550> you<00:01:27.670> go

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
be the production cockpit when you go

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.460 
be the production cockpit when you go
and<00:01:27.940> look<00:01:28.030> at<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.720> rear<00:01:28.900> of<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.050> airplane

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
and look at the the rear of the airplane

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.540 
and look at the the rear of the airplane
of<00:01:29.650> course<00:01:29.800> there<00:01:29.950> is<00:01:30.040> virtually<00:01:30.370> nothing

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
of course there is virtually nothing

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.220 
of course there is virtually nothing
that's<00:01:30.910> similar<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.720> real<00:01:31.870> airplane

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
that's similar to the real airplane

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.390 
that's similar to the real airplane
because<00:01:32.440> it's<00:01:32.650> full<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:32.860> flight<00:01:33.130> test

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
because it's full of flight test

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400 
because it's full of flight test
instrumentation<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.570> we<00:01:34.690> do<00:01:34.810> have<00:01:35.020> one<00:01:35.170> or<00:01:35.260> two

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
instrumentation so we do have one or two

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.600 
instrumentation so we do have one or two
things<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.770> have<00:01:35.800> some<00:01:36.040> switches<00:01:36.400> back<00:01:36.550> here

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
things we have some switches back here

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.870 
things we have some switches back here
to<00:01:37.090> control<00:01:38.160> some<00:01:39.160> changes<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.730> flight

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
to control some changes to the flight

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.360 
to control some changes to the flight
control<00:01:40.300> laws<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.680> allow<00:01:41.950> us<00:01:42.130> to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
control laws and to allow us to

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.180 
control laws and to allow us to
intervene<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.790> little<00:01:43.120> bit<00:01:43.240> with<00:01:43.420> what's<00:01:43.660> being

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
intervene a little bit with what's being

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.970 
intervene a little bit with what's being
input<00:01:45.190> into<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.550> systems<00:01:45.910> through<00:01:46.450> the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
input into the systems through the

when we start the the flight test then a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.010 
when we start the the flight test then a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
lot of it is actually to do with the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.510 
lot of it is actually to do with the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.089 
the flight control systems the response
of<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.750> airplane<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.410> gradually

introducing the Augmented flight control
I'm<00:02:15.129> feeling<00:02:15.730> fine<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> would<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.629> on

I'm feeling fine I would like to get on
with<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.080> know<00:02:17.230> we've<00:02:17.410> been<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.890> long<00:02:18.069> in

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
with it you know we've been so long in

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.400 
with it you know we've been so long in
the<00:02:18.280> preparation<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.660> we're<00:02:19.780> now<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.140> close

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the preparation and we're now so close

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.039 
the preparation and we're now so close
that<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.310> want<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.519> get<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.760> and

that we just really want to get in and

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.330 
that we just really want to get in and
and<00:02:23.049> get<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.470> we're<00:02:23.650> about<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.980> do<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
and get going we're about to do the the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.509 
and get going we're about to do the the
high<00:02:25.090> speed<00:02:25.390> order<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.780> take<00:02:25.989> off<00:02:26.519> straight

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
high speed order to take off straight

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.800 
high speed order to take off straight
Shane<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.000> can't<00:02:28.180> go<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.299> bit<00:02:28.420> faster<00:02:28.720> and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
Shane we can't go a bit faster and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.030 
Shane we can't go a bit faster and
actually<00:02:29.019> get<00:02:29.140> airborne<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.590> we'd<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:29.920> to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
actually get airborne but we'd have to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.180 
actually get airborne but we'd have to
wait<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.579> couple<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:31.030> days
