00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.360 

okay<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:02.040> just<00:00:02.520> wanted<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.970> go<00:00:03.419> over<00:00:03.449> some

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
okay I just wanted to go over some

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.070 
okay I just wanted to go over some
standard<00:00:05.370> dominant<00:00:06.029> chord<00:00:06.299> shapes<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:07.020> I

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
standard dominant chord shapes that I

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.780 
standard dominant chord shapes that I
use<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.799> couple<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.189> different<00:00:08.460> ways<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
use in a couple of different ways to

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.410 
use in a couple of different ways to
apply<00:00:09.090> them<00:00:10.070> basically<00:00:11.070> we're<00:00:11.759> all<00:00:11.790> used<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
apply them basically we're all used to

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.400 
apply them basically we're all used to
playing<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> G<00:00:13.650> chord

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.540 

and<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.509> g7<00:00:23.259> and<00:00:23.529> we<00:00:24.009> use<00:00:24.160> lots<00:00:24.430> of

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
and that is a g7 and we use lots of

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:33.860 
and that is a g7 and we use lots of
different<00:00:24.910> voicings<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.779> g7<00:00:26.199> s<00:00:26.529> in<00:00:26.650> bluegrass

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.990 

yeah<00:00:34.870> but<00:00:35.379> that's<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:36.519> know<00:00:36.610> we<00:00:36.730> think<00:00:36.879> of

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
yeah but that's you know we think of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.569 
yeah but that's you know we think of
that<00:00:37.150> as<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.300> g7<00:00:37.720> well<00:00:38.379> in<00:00:38.650> that<00:00:39.040> it<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.400> of

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
that as a g7 well in that it is of

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.509 
that as a g7 well in that it is of
course<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:41.140> um<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.820> jazzy<00:00:43.510> or<00:00:43.629> music<00:00:44.519> there

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
course but um in jazzy or music there

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.390 
course but um in jazzy or music there
are<00:00:46.589> colorations<00:00:47.589> you<00:00:47.769> can<00:00:47.949> use<00:00:48.159> on<00:00:48.370> a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
are colorations you can use on a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.760 
are colorations you can use on a
dominant<00:00:49.329> chord<00:00:49.510> which<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:50.230> know<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.350> dominant

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
dominant chord which you know a dominant

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.170 
dominant chord which you know a dominant
chord<00:00:50.859> is<00:00:51.010> really<00:00:51.219> but<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:51.699> think<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:52.000> lot<00:00:52.149> of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
chord is really but I think a lot of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.099 
chord is really but I think a lot of
people<00:00:52.449> call<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.350> jazzman's<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:54.520> know

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
people call the the jazzman's you know

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.330 
people call the the jazzman's you know
land<00:00:56.109> that<00:00:56.410> through<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.590> place<00:00:56.829> where<00:00:57.070> all

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
land that through the place where all

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.910 
land that through the place where all
that<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:58.210> many<00:00:58.300> cool<00:00:58.600> sounds<00:00:59.140> exist<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.739> on<00:00:59.890> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
that so many cool sounds exist is on a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.779 
that so many cool sounds exist is on a
dominant<00:01:00.399> chord

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
dominant chord

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.529 
dominant chord
lots<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.239> tensions<00:01:01.660> available<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:03.539> there's

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
lots of tensions available and there's

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.690 
lots of tensions available and there's
there<00:01:05.259> are<00:01:05.289> some<00:01:05.530> tensions<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.369> I<00:01:06.429> call

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
there are some tensions that I call

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.940 
there are some tensions that I call
consonant<00:01:07.390> tensions<00:01:07.750> there<00:01:08.020> there<00:01:08.500> tensions

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
consonant tensions there there tensions

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.749 
consonant tensions there there tensions
that<00:01:09.160> are<00:01:09.340> make<00:01:09.789> a<00:01:10.000> pretty<00:01:10.360> dominant<00:01:10.600> chord<00:01:11.759> of

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
that are make a pretty dominant chord of

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.219 
that are make a pretty dominant chord of
course<00:01:13.060> you've<00:01:13.179> got<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> line<00:01:13.660> three<00:01:13.990> five

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
course you've got the line three five

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.060 
course you've got the line three five
and<00:01:14.259> seven

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
and seven

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.669 
and seven
but<00:01:15.429> then<00:01:15.640> on<00:01:16.020> consonant<00:01:17.020> tensions<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.470> think

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
but then on consonant tensions I think

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.200 
but then on consonant tensions I think
of<00:01:17.800> them<00:01:17.979> as<00:01:18.190> two<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.890> six<00:01:21.399> for<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.700> most<00:01:21.880> part

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
of them as two and six for the most part

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.430 
of them as two and six for the most part
you<00:01:22.689> know<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.920> sus4

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.890 

is<00:01:28.440> fine<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.160> use<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> takes<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.290> 3/7

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
is fine to use but it takes the the 3/7

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.120 
is fine to use but it takes the the 3/7
away<00:01:33.900> from<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> dominant<00:01:34.770> chord<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.520> get

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
away from the dominant chord so you get

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.260 
away from the dominant chord so you get
and<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.460> takes<00:01:38.640> away<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.910> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and it kind of takes away that the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
and it kind of takes away that the
function<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.740> take<00:01:40.890> away<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.070> function<00:01:41.370> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
function then take away the function but

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.790 
function then take away the function but
it<00:01:41.550> basically<00:01:41.610> changes<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.450> tonality<00:01:43.110> from

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it basically changes the tonality from

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.580 
it basically changes the tonality from
to<00:01:44.520> chase<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.940> away<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.480> real<00:01:45.690> strong

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to chase it away from a real strong

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.910 
to chase it away from a real strong
dominant<00:01:47.130> sound<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:49.040> there's<00:01:50.040> also<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.430> sharp

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
dominant sound but there's also a sharp

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.610 
dominant sound but there's also a sharp
for<00:01:53.480> kind<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.630> Lydian<00:01:54.930> dominant<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
for kind of a Lydian dominant kind of

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.960 
for kind of a Lydian dominant kind of
sound<00:01:55.800> but<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.370> what<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:56.640> what

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
sound but that's not what really what

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.190 
sound but that's not what really what
I'm<00:01:57.060> looking<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.360> right<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.570> basically<00:01:58.140> I'm

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I'm looking at right now basically I'm

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.470 
I'm looking at right now basically I'm
looking<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.650> 6<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> 9<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.970> dominant

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
looking at a 6 and a 9 on dominant

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.680 
looking at a 6 and a 9 on dominant
chords<00:02:00.750> here's<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.590> here's<00:02:02.010> 6<00:02:02.690> dominant

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
chords here's the here's 6 dominant

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.340 
chords here's the here's 6 dominant
chords<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> use<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.700> color<00:02:06.350> consonant

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
chords that I use to color consonant

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.820 
chords that I use to color consonant
dominance<00:02:08.990> GG<00:02:09.990> here's<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.100> 7<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> 13<00:02:12.780> so

neck is up here so this one then if you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.810 
neck is up here so this one then if you
keep<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.840> 7<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.440> shift<00:02:37.950> D<00:02:38.130> voicings<00:02:38.520> up<00:02:38.700> you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
keep that 7 and shift D voicings up you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.520 
keep that 7 and shift D voicings up you
got<00:02:38.970> 7<00:02:40.100> 3<00:02:41.120> 13<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.390> 1

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
g7 13 which is sitting at 13 the next

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160 
g7 13 which is sitting at 13 the next
one<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> g9<00:02:52.560> which<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.740> use<00:02:54.210> which<00:02:55.210> is<00:02:55.360> root<00:02:55.630> 3

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
one is a g9 which I use which is root 3

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.040 
one is a g9 which I use which is root 3
79<00:02:56.950> sometimes<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:57.970> play<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:59.020> make

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
79 sometimes I play it like this to make

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.140 
79 sometimes I play it like this to make
it<00:02:59.200> ambiguous<00:02:59.590> with<00:03:00.070> no<00:03:00.220> third<00:03:00.520> but<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.000> is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
it ambiguous with no third but this is

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.480 
it ambiguous with no third but this is
basically

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.590 

then<00:03:08.490> from<00:03:08.670> there<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.240> jump<00:03:10.020> up<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.230> here<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
then from there I jump up to here and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.800 
then from there I jump up to here and
that's<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.740> g9<00:03:13.740> as<00:03:14.010> well<00:03:14.250> three<00:03:14.940> seven<00:03:15.630> three

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that's a g9 as well three seven three

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.030 
that's a g9 as well three seven three
nine<00:03:17.420> clothes<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.630> boys<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.990> processes

nine clothes for boys to processes

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.060 
nine clothes for boys to processes
nice<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.060> open<00:03:21.210> sounding<00:03:21.870> that's<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.920> much

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
nice and open sounding that's a much

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.850 
nice and open sounding that's a much
little<00:03:23.640> bit<00:03:23.760> dance<00:03:23.990> voicing<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.290> from

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
little bit dance voicing of it from

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.880 
little bit dance voicing of it from
there<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.340> keep<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.360> third<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
there I keep the third and then the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.000 
there I keep the third and then the
seven<00:03:29.250> there<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:30.450> play<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.810> G<00:03:31.020> 9<00:03:31.230> which<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.590> 3

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
seven there and play that G 9 which is 3

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.490 
seven there and play that G 9 which is 3
7<00:03:34.550> as<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.880> turn<00:03:36.030> into<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.300> flat<00:03:37.020> five<00:03:37.230> easy

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
7 as you can turn into a flat five easy

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.010 
7 as you can turn into a flat five easy
or<00:03:38.490> sharp<00:03:38.850> lines<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:45.300> from<00:03:45.510> there<00:03:45.750> I

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
or sharp lines so and from there I

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.690 
or sharp lines so and from there I
basically<00:03:46.560> moved<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.040> note<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.459> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
basically moved this note up to the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.790 
basically moved this note up to the
fifth<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.090> chord<00:03:48.360> keep<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.410> seventh

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
fifth of the chord keep the seventh

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.449 
fifth of the chord keep the seventh
there's<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> three<00:03:51.380> there's<00:03:52.380> twenty<00:03:53.010> thirteen

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
there's a three there's twenty thirteen

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.910 
there's a three there's twenty thirteen
again<00:03:53.610> which<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.540> really<00:03:54.930> very<00:03:55.350> much<00:03:55.650> like

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
again which is really very much like

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.790 
again which is really very much like
where<00:03:56.130> we<00:03:56.220> started<00:03:57.140> this<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> little<00:03:58.620> closer

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
where we started this is a little closer

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.960 
where we started this is a little closer
voicing<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.030> little<00:04:00.300> wider<00:04:00.720> voice<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.820> those

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
voicing is a little wider voice so those

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.020 
voicing is a little wider voice so those
are<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.209> six<00:04:03.709> types<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.980> what<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.850> call

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
are the six types of what I call

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.680 
are the six types of what I call
constant<00:04:06.540> at<00:04:06.630> dominant<00:04:07.790> chord<00:04:08.790> voicings<00:04:09.600> that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
constant at dominant chord voicings that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.949 
constant at dominant chord voicings that
I<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.170> use<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.769> lot<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.280> then<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.840> an

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
I that I use a lot and then just an

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.740 
I that I use a lot and then just an
application<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.650> what<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.730> get<00:04:15.330> if<00:04:15.600> you

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
application of that what you get if you

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.500 
application of that what you get if you
take<00:04:15.780> those<00:04:16.229> voicings<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.269> offset<00:04:18.269> them<00:04:18.479> by

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
take those voicings and offset them by

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.300 
take those voicings and offset them by
six<00:04:18.930> frets<00:04:19.260> or<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> tritone<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:21.150> get<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
six frets or a tritone you get the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.870 
six frets or a tritone you get the
voicings<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.180> work<00:04:24.590> for<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:26.090> g7<00:04:27.440> alt<00:04:28.440> court<00:04:28.880> so

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
voicings that work for a g7 alt court so

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.460 
voicings that work for a g7 alt court so
if<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.300> were<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.450> take<00:04:30.720> this<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.200> what<00:04:31.320> we're

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
if I were to take this is what we're

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.270 
if I were to take this is what we're
hearing<00:04:31.680> g7<00:04:33.590> now<00:04:34.590> if<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.740> were<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.890> take<00:04:35.100> those

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
hearing g7 now if I were to take those

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.490 
hearing g7 now if I were to take those
voicings<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:35.970> offset<00:04:36.479> them<00:04:36.690> by<00:04:36.720> six<00:04:37.080> courts
