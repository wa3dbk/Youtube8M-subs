couldn't<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.949> would<00:01:04.160> they<00:01:04.309> could<00:01:04.489> get<00:01:04.610> up

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
couldn't it would they could get up

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.730 
couldn't it would they could get up
there<00:01:04.759> but<00:01:05.000> it<00:01:05.089> would<00:01:05.180> take<00:01:05.210> them<00:01:05.509> a<00:01:05.539> while<00:01:05.740> but

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
there but it would take them a while but

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.680 
there but it would take them a while but
you<00:01:06.800> can<00:01:06.920> still<00:01:07.130> easily<00:01:07.910> protect<00:01:08.420> yourself

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
you can still easily protect yourself

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.020 
you can still easily protect yourself
from<00:01:08.720> zombies<00:01:09.200> by<00:01:09.320> getting<00:01:09.560> up<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.100> towers

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
from zombies by getting up in the towers

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.240 
from zombies by getting up in the towers
but<00:01:11.840> if<00:01:12.050> there<00:01:12.289> are<00:01:12.410> multiple<00:01:12.590> ones<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.039> can

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
but if there are multiple ones you can

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.580 
but if there are multiple ones you can
get<00:01:13.430> overrun<00:01:13.789> pretty<00:01:14.060> easily<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:15.229> place<00:01:15.410> has

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590

a high threat just because there are

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.649 
a high threat just because there are
tons<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.570> zombies<00:01:17.899> that<00:01:17.960> spawn<00:01:18.200> around<00:01:18.470> and

more right there go around so I don't

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.059
