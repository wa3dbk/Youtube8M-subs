it's<00:00:06.270> going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.480> be<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.870> do<00:00:07.370> like

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
it's going to be how to do like

consider<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.469> throw<00:00:13.710> up<00:00:13.920> simple<00:00:14.429> lettering

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
consider to throw up simple lettering

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.710 
consider to throw up simple lettering
but<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.350> principle<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.119> every<00:00:18.119> letter<00:00:18.330> kind

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
but the principle is every letter kind

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.580 
but the principle is every letter kind
of<00:00:18.810> follows<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> formula<00:00:20.039> none<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.210> is

of follows a formula none of this is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.950 
of follows a formula none of this is
just<00:00:22.590> coming<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> nowhere<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.960> for

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.859 

very<00:01:04.899> simple<00:01:05.350> now<00:01:06.189> you<00:01:06.250> see<00:01:06.460> how<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.579> a<00:01:06.700> is<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
very simple now you see how the a is the

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
sea is not going to be an a but you can

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:20.010 
sea is not going to be an a but you can
see<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:14.229> similarities<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.439> style<00:01:17.939> ABC<00:01:19.020> now

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
see the similarities the style ABC now

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.529 
see the similarities the style ABC now
the<00:01:20.109> D<00:01:20.500> what<00:01:20.799> is<00:01:20.829> it<00:01:21.009> going<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.219> look<00:01:21.340> like

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
the D what is it going to look like

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.109 
the D what is it going to look like
obviously<00:01:22.539> it'd<00:01:22.780> be<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:24.520> much<00:01:24.819> just

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.520 
tight space here now I'm gonna do an e
which<00:01:39.110> is<00:01:39.290> very<00:01:39.620> similar<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.370> e<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.729> course

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
which is very similar to the e of course

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.990 
which is very similar to the e of course
and<00:01:43.270> once<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.420> do<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.750> enough<00:01:44.960> times<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:46.790> know
