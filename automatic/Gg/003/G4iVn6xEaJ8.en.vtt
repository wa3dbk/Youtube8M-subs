00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello I am April welcome once 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.040
 more forgetting of the April essays 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.719
 I hope you are very well this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.790
 is the second video of a series of 7 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.170
 videos that I'm going to do to celebrate the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.790
 two years of this channel 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.850
 remember that I am using the hashtag 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.670
 April 2 April and then if I am very 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.949
 happy because after two years of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.029
 existence on youtube as book to see 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 I'm going to finally make the top of 10 book 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.279
 great tubert that I love that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.680
 I frequent that I like what they say 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 how they do it and all those things I should 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.870
 clarify that what they have in common 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 ten people is that they are far from 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.320
 stereotype of book tube as well 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.149
 call him so I hope they give them a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 opportunity and that the time of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 visit their channels because believe me in my 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.840
 opinion I consider to be a content 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.850
 is quite worth this top 10 does not have 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.199
 no specific order what does 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 you can go is that I never miss the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 videos of these people good first 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.430
 I want to recommend you to the notebook 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 tweets 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.900
 is a Colombian boy I love how 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 he expresses himself also speaks of much 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.700
 classical literature and so good here what 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.490
 I leave I hope to have a positional turn 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 He makes me super nice after 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.340
 I also want to stop with giving them back 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.560
 he sees them is a girl who lives in yucatan 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.770
 she also reviews a lot of literature 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 classic and divides the book of all kinds 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.630
 but what catches my attention the most 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 she is very signal is very difficult that I 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.920
 do not agree with your opinions but 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.180
 you've already said it better myself not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 forget is very active in the networks 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.790
 social like on facebook so it's very 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.649
 difficult not to be aware of everything 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 that she publishes I want to recommend to 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.729
 culturoso blog in this channel 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.830
 Moses expresses about the centuries of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.170
 a way that I love it seems to me that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.920
 he is an announcer of some station 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 radio over there in monterrey I think 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.119
 and you're watching this video and I said it wrong 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.950
 clarify it please in the comments 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.750
 the thing is that I love the only thing that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.000
 I do not like about culture your blog is that if 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.350
 I take a lot to upload videos. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.630
 the videos you have so far I 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.300
 they love and apart their voice is precious 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.310
 I also want to recommend you to Karen from 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.050
 the flowers are crazy and they are from toluca 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.910
 I was very pleased with the state of Mexico 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.220
 concept because she is very cool is 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.810
 very funny also the opinions that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.360
 has about the books floor 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
 agree with them actually I think that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.630
 she is providing a very 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.190
 different from what bush you see is 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.780
 accustomed and then it is not too much 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.180
 give him a great opportunity after 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.610
 I want to talk about the next core under 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.569
 which is a channel that I just recently 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.340
 I discovered 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.870
 so by the recommendations of youtube 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 and when I entered I kept my mouth open 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.400
 because the truth is that it has a style 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.739
 fantastic I'm not sure which countries 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.630
 but he talks as if he were from Spain- 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.940
 that if you do not read spain also clear of 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.100
 what country are you but I love it because 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.200
 has its analysts its bookseller and has 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.300
 a huge red chair maybe although the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.280
 red is my favorite color 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.990
 If I'm going to watch your video company 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.090
 stories about those in such a way 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.700
 great and exquisite has a sense of 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.980
 great humor later I want to talk to you 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.510
 of loyal oscar that loyal oscar is one of 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.790
 the big two bears with more time here in 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.250
 book tube only that I had not seen his 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.050
 videos can clarify something to look for what 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.360
 I met at the international fair of 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.670
 book of the palace of mining and chopped and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.650
 those cards because then it 's almost the sign 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.420
 the distance is very handsome I told him if I 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.920
 I'm subscribing to your channel because I do not know 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.480
 what moment of my life is already accredited 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.770
 subscribed to your channel but I said good if 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.330
 it's a fish and a channel but I 've never 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.250
 given really kind of machismo of two 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.720
 When I arrived at my house I realized 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.810
 that was not subscribed to a channel 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.940
 Imagine 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 so I subscribed and saw his videos 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.010
 directs like that is to oscar but now with 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.020
 reason and with sense because those videos 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.260
 they are great makes criticism of a 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.790
 so special and great and fun way 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.590
 so if you still do not know 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.690
 look for the thing that you see very difficult but 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.030
 If this is the case, then go and see their 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.870
 videos later I want to recommend them to 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.549
 two girls 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.860
 that have a channel together that 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.140
 called a station because the two 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.459
 it's called nana which is great because 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.650
 Well, I'll never miss the name 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.450
 always said wool and then I always go to 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.739
 be fine they also have a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.379
 peculiar way of talking about books 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.110
 apart from that it is a literary taste is 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.879
 exquisite or they definitely speak 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.769
 of books that we will never find in 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.049
 book tube give great importance to the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.139
 Peruvian literature thing that I consider 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.490
 very valuable also love sakura car 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.530
 captor in the same way I want 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.930
 recommend them to charles from the tail of 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.930
 talk even though I think that already 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.289
 You know , I think it's also Spanish and 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.539
 He also talks about Spanish literature and 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.610
 classical literature because he studied 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.470
 Hispanic philology so its 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.780
 comments and their opinions are always 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.160
 very successful and well-justified 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.050
 things that I quite like about the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.789
 videos then it's also difficult channel 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.550
 of course the myth can not be absent 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.830
 Andrea Moreno is so great and so great 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.449
 different from what we know on youtube 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.120
 what she has in her channel up 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.820
 right now is top quality as well 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.160
 that also let them arise 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.500
 in case you did not know her, believe me, believe me 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.230
 she is very worthwhile could not miss 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.070
 in this topic of Peru said books 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.650
 because it is a Latin asia and I do the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.750
 tuning although it's the only one I know 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.480
 he really has a sense of humor 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.940
 exquisite I love everything that makes it 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.400
 everything he says apart he is a 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.250
 rare class definitely because it's from 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.410
 Japanese ancestry but is Peruvian 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.690
 something very strange if you do not know him yet 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.660
 so go see your channel and tell him 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.610
 they have arrived there thanks to me and so with 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.320
 all the other 9 of October that I have 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.870
 presented I hope you liked it 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.030
 a lot of myth I hope they give the time 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.710
 to meet these people and then if 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.600
 this has been all thank you very much for 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.910
 be celebrating with me two years of 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.950
 this videoblog so special essays 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.030
 april remembers the april hashtag does not come out 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.560
 April 2 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.090
 if they want to make me any kind of 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.220
 Comment on any of the networks 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.320
 social and so they have excellent 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.600
 life and see you 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.020
 I always try to recommend you boc 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.020
 verse 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.009

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.600
 and they tell him to come up more I'm sure 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.600
