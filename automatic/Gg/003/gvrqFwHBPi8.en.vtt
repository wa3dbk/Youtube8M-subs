00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello everyone my name is everyone to press 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.599
 today tell you how to do fuck up 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.599
 specifically for the channel right into 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.840
 ok buddhism their favorite tricks and not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.869
 we can perform but with it 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.210
 may not smoke and rub their mission 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.180
 Junna should not focus 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.919
 on the fact that in order for you to the number of gap 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.490
 need to be able to on these with access to 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.450
 halsted 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.470
 u to and can do two different 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.910
 in ways 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.770
 The first method is more suitable for 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.500
 beginners guys who are just learning 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.880
 trick and second for those who already understood how 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.620
 he is done and wants to bring it to 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.680
 perfect now I will tell you more 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.330
 about each of these ways 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.980
 not so the number one way most 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:56.290
 easy to do 180 degrees 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.370
 in the center of activity we shift a little back and 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.220
 turn the front wheel sideways 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.970
 by about 30 loads creating a small 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.430
 arc 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.300
 scroll one circle pedal exactly 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.000
 we clamp the item to those 2 leaving the back 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.850
 wheel and start spinning after that 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.940
 as the veil rider reaches 180 degrees 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.760
 we give another push 180 degrees 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.620
 thereby dokruchivat 360 I do not think that 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.040
 it is worth talking about the exit of its whale and so 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.040
 all clear 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.590
 and directly the second way most 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.280
 beautiful rules are pretty much the same 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.170
 most doing 180 body position remains 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.979
 that is, that's the same breast medals 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.729
 clamp fly no longer waiting for the base 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:55.240
 when we spun with 180 degrees give 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.709
 jerk after degrees 30 and 45 and already 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.709
 fully screw it up so far 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.429
 most novice riders most often 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.709
 Well, the trick is faced with a number of errors 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.000
 which I will explain to you now error 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.150
 number one 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.570
 after 180 degrees the raider doesn't follow 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.520
 the position of her body and therefore she does not 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.740
 it turns out to take 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.060
 what leads here such here is not clear 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.470
 consequences physically can't do 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.880
 and go the same mistake the second lot 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.349
 rider face problem not 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.959
 swirling fuckable 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.520
 it mostly happens because 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.250
 insufficient by no one 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.959
 or again for lack of spirit in front 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.950
 jerk 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.500
 to avoid all this you need 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.340
 follow your body step by step and for its 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 movements we will repeat we go on average 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.030
 speeds 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.700
 doing a 180 degree ride on its center 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.580
 gravity shift slightly to the side to the side 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.260
 rotation and back make one booth 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.439
 pedals and we clamp 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.379
 thereby allowing you to catch a balance on 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:13.069
 back wheel and depending on your 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:16.430
 skill and experience to give a degree either after 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.110
 180 or him after 30 and 45 degrees already in 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.269
 whichever you understand 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.360
 trick in principle regarding this trick 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.720
 I was told there was nothing more to try. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.159
 try to learn and you must 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.590
 everything should work out 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.590
 and get ready to protect them like me 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.110
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.690
 write in the comments such hack would 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.690
 you wanted to see next time all bye
