00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.230 

I<00:00:06.859> frequently<00:00:07.859> hear<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:08.400> people<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:09.000> their

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
I frequently hear from people that their

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
I frequently hear from people that their
mayonnaise<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.929> too<00:00:10.260> thin<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:10.950> watery<00:00:11.429> or<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
mayonnaise is too thin or watery or the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.390 
mayonnaise is too thin or watery or the
oil<00:00:12.450> separated<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> show

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
oil separated so what I'm going to show

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010 
oil separated so what I'm going to show
you<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.910> today<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.360> actually<00:00:15.540> how<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
you how to do today is actually how to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.830 
you how to do today is actually how to
save<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.430> call<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> broken<00:00:18.420> mayonnaise

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
save what we call a broken mayonnaise

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
save what we call a broken mayonnaise
that<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.289> means<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> emulsion<00:00:20.189> is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that just means that the emulsion is

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550 
that just means that the emulsion is
broken<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> oil<00:00:21.390> has<00:00:21.630> separated<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
broken so the oil has separated from the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.099 
broken so the oil has separated from the
rest<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> minis<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:24.930> our

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
rest of the minis so here we have our

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.080 
rest of the minis so here we have our
broken<00:00:25.470> mayonnaise<00:00:25.800> basically<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> reason

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
broken mayonnaise basically the reason

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
broken mayonnaise basically the reason
why<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.240> happens<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> most<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> time

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
why this happens is most of the time

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.349 
why this happens is most of the time
it's<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.130> people<00:00:29.279> add<00:00:29.730> their<00:00:29.939> oil<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
it's because people add their oil a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.269 
it's because people add their oil a
little<00:00:30.570> bit<00:00:30.689> too<00:00:30.869> quickly<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.040> things

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
little bit too quickly and so things

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.740 
little bit too quickly and so things
just<00:00:32.550> start<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> separate<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.510> don't

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
just start to separate and they don't

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.229 
just start to separate and they don't
come<00:00:34.530> together<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.190> nicely<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.969> should

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
come together as nicely as they should

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.930 
come together as nicely as they should
but<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.140> actually<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.620> saved<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.820> I'm

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
but it can actually be saved so I'm

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
but it can actually be saved so I'm
actually<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> switch<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.530> using<00:00:40.980> my

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
actually going to switch to using my

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
actually going to switch to using my
immersion<00:00:41.940> blender<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
immersion blender I actually have the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
immersion blender I actually have the
whisk<00:00:43.410> attachment<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.370> immersion

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
whisk attachment on here but immersion

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
whisk attachment on here but immersion
blender<00:00:44.969> would<00:00:45.120> work<00:00:45.270> well<00:00:45.480> too<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.440> also

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
blender would work well too you can also

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
blender would work well too you can also
just<00:00:46.860> use<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.309> whisk<00:00:47.579> by<00:00:47.879> hand<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.270> you'd<00:00:48.420> like

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
just use a whisk by hand if you'd like

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
just use a whisk by hand if you'd like
otherwise<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.620> still<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.100> blender

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
otherwise you can still use your blender

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
otherwise you can still use your blender
but<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> need<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> clean<00:00:51.059> everything<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but you need to clean everything out and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
but you need to clean everything out and
