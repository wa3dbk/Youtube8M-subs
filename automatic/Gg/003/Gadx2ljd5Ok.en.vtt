00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.210
 throughout Jesus' life he did 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.410
 many miracles 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.230
 many healings 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.689
 He did many signs and wonders for 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.350
 show people that he was going to be 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.980
 your healer 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.680
 that he was going to be his provider 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.870
 who was going to be his pastor 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.100
 and that it will not matter what the 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:36.680
 people he could give them but also 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.210
 he realized that a lot of people 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.970
 I needed there were too many needs 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.809
 and they needed a savior who 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.560
 forever be the pastor of all the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.690
 humanity 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:57.230
 but I knew that to be her pastor 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.770
 it would have to be delivered to pay for 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.580
 our sins 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.490
 next to his disciples and told them that 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.180
 soon he would be delivered to die in 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.390
 a cross 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.430
 they could not believe it like jesus 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.310
 was delivered by them 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 but he knew we needed a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.170
 pastor someone to take care of us and that we 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.800
 love and to do that I would have to die 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800
 for us 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.530
 the night before being delivered it was to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.570
 getsemanÃ­ with his disciples to spend 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.979
 time with god 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.250
 to reflect before paying this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.530
 so serious price 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 I knew I would have to pay a price 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.920
 very high 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.270
 but at this time so difficult 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.270
 he was alone 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.160
 father 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.680
 I know that your children need a pastor 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.220
 I know they need there 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.850
 who knows 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.200
 take care of them 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.200
 someone to protect us 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.940
 I know that that person has to be me 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.330
 but father 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.250
 if it can happen in some other way 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.280
 that I do not have to suffer this 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 please do it 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.220
 and that's it 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.010
 if it is necessary that they suffer 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.010
 I'm willing to do 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.500
 I am willing to be your pastor 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.120
 Jesus loves us so much 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.480
 that at that moment 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.659
 he did not care how much he was going to pay 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.980
 it's going to hurt so much 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.090
 suffer 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.409
 he thought of us and decided to pay the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.280
 penalty decided to pay the price to be 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.600
 our pastor 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.250
 when he returned with his disciples 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.670
 the priests and the temple guards 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.670
 they came for him 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.290
 They brought him before the Sanhedrin the high 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.290
 priests 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.100
 and they decided to crucify what 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.050
 Jesus was always holy and just before the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.930
 eyes of the law but they convinced the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.960
 Romans to take care of crucifying 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.960
 Jesus 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:43.599
 that day jesus then sent 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.599
 and he received 39 lashes on his back 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.270
 besides the soldiers put on their 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.270
 head a crown of thorns 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.300
 They hung Jesus on a cross 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.670
 until he gave me 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.350
 but while Jesus was hanging on that cross 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.350
 while suffering so much pain 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.990
 he thought of one thing 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.680
 in which all of us need to 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.389
 someone who is our healer someone 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.889
 let it be our portion and our 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.449
 provider 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:42.300
 we all need someone to guide us 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.960
 let him be our pastor and think about 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.229
 us at all times 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.020
 Jesus decided to pay the price so that 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.080
 we had someone who we 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.370
 love forever 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.270
 so that we always had to 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.270
 A pastor
