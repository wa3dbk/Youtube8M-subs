00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the Premier League made me more physical

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.290 
the Premier League made me more physical
element<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> game<00:00:58.079> um<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.940> nothing<00:01:00.210> we

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
element to the game um but nothing we

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.430 
element to the game um but nothing we
shouldn't<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.570> able<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> handle<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.199> mean<00:01:01.350> I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.720 
shouldn't be able to handle I mean I
think<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.710> long<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.219> over<00:01:02.340> solid

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
think as long as we go over solid

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
think as long as we go over solid
defense<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> maybe<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.229> could<00:01:04.350> experiment<00:01:04.739> up

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
defense and maybe we could experiment up

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
defense and maybe we could experiment up
top<00:01:05.309> maybe<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> likes<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> Ryo

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
Sanogo is back in the first team and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
Sanogo is back in the first team and
maybe<00:01:33.869> we'll<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> real<00:01:34.470> chance<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.189> him

maybe we'll get a real chance to see him

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
maybe we'll get a real chance to see him
because<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.729> haven't<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.030> seen<00:01:36.299> uses<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
because we haven't really seen uses to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
because we haven't really seen uses to
start<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.229> start<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> campaign<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.610> we

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
start the start of the campaign when we

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.890 
start the start of the campaign when we
saw<00:01:38.790> him<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> couple<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.299> Champions<00:01:39.750> League

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
saw him in a couple of Champions League

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.740 
saw him in a couple of Champions League
games<00:01:40.140> against<00:01:40.439> spin<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.740> Jay<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:42.180> did

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
games against spin about Jay and he did

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.149 
games against spin about Jay and he did
nothing<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.350> impress<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.040> very

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
nothing to really impress he was very

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.649 
nothing to really impress he was very
quiet<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> dice<00:01:44.939> game<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
quiet for a dice game so I would like to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
quiet for a dice game so I would like to
see<00:01:45.930> him<00:01:46.020> make<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:46.920> impact<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.490> this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
see him make it make an impact in this

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.600 
see him make it make an impact in this
squad<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.990> well<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.009> we've

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
squad as well as that you know we've

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.859 
squad as well as that you know we've
lost<00:01:50.790> four<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.000> its<00:01:51.149> key<00:01:51.299> first<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
lost four as its key first one and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.090 
lost four as its key first one and
obviously<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.229> that's<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> massive<00:01:52.799> blow

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
obviously I think that's a massive blow

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.380 
obviously I think that's a massive blow
I<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.579> might<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.880> need<00:01:53.939> him<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.299> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
I know we might not need him in this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
I know we might not need him in this
game<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.110> he's<00:01:55.259> put<00:01:55.470> some<00:01:55.649> really

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
game but I think he's put some really

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.499 
game but I think he's put some really
good<00:01:55.979> performances<00:01:56.430> together<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> late<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
good performances together as of late I

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
good performances together as of late I
would<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.140> liked<00:01:58.320> into<00:01:58.680> featuring<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.219> I
