00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 everything will be left as they are and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 be all welcome again the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.179
 today we are back and just the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710
 today in the morning entered what 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.570
 it's plants against zombies await 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 obviously warfare with the aim of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.960
 see the news that more or less already 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.270
 we had in mind that they were going to get 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 up to us just today 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 and effectively guys just 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 add two little things out there 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 interesting the first one is that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.289
 it obviously starts in activity what 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.119
 is the community challenge 'of this 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 week we were talking a little bit 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.020
 about that a couple of days ago 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.790
 there but well that's not the issue 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.800
 main thing today that maybe what 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 we will take as theme for a video 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.670
 next or a video after this the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.440
 Today I'm going to focus on what is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.239
 the new list of games that have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
 added is that since this is the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.520
 second novelty out there was added 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 a new playlist which is going to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 consist of the combination of what 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.640
 is to defeat by teams and defeat 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.289
 confirmed well let's be able to play 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.880
 these two modalities so 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.820
 random but in what they are 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.190
 maps of the outskirts and I do not know very well 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.920
 what this has to do but the case is 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.870
 who have chosen certain maps so 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.150
 that they have been called the maps of the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.130
 outskirts and now this consists between a 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.650
 combination of two modalities and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.330
 various maps called from the outskirts and 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.100
 fence to play one more modality in 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.320
 a list of game as pretty 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.540
 random enough pretty combined 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.800
 fun what could I say so 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.600
 alright guys let's see how it is going 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.280
 this is going to take us to the little soldier 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990
 first soldier that I was by 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.850
 there it comes out and we are now at the beginning 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 the game I got into this 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.550
 modality comes out is pretty much a kind of 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.229
 mixed mode go what is then 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.240
 Pretty funny, I'm talking very 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.830
 short because obviously it is to defeat by 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.900
 teams and they know that it does not last long 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.460
 let's say and also what is defeat 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.619
 confirmed not that it's not like either 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.060
 last too long because nothing else consists 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.850
 in doing kilos not the first one that reaches 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.009
 50 boom ends not so to see here 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.610
 one that was hidden above see there the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.250
 I am a champion of camps, I am one of 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.240
 true as a whole carnivorous goddess all 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 for this kit for her because 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.399
 because it is no longer champion and companion 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.319
 Rays with his life but he's going to come back 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.910
 Well, what are you going to see if we can make a 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.250
 good game here today 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.370
 this is going to take us to chester by 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.850
 this hat is making a mess 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.990
 Okay, well 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.100
 the joke was making a mess 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.840
 inside 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.810

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.910

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.200
 Subscriber are I imagine a little hello 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.330

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.810
 I moved from the place I moved too much of the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.470
 where I was originally going to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.630
 swallow and managed to swallow me it's amazing what 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.850
 what you just did is true sometimes the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.320
 which banks end up surprising me in 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.630
 each of his plays that can 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.960
 come to be between the combination of 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.450
 life and the game book in truth that 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.070
 sometimes they usually do amazing things 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.440
 that you do not think they can perform but 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.450

 according 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.750
 since the water endured the missile set 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.630
 held the missile for god I'm water and 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.280
 if someone put his healing very well I 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.290
 they read the mind they have read my mind 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.390
 seriously send me what would be stealing 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.580

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.400
 no no no no I'm sick of the 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.950
 carnivorous I'm sick of you 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.490
 hit aila 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.030
 I do not think that the moment has fallen 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.030
 precise 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.759
 what's wrong with you 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.810
 so you want to fork the bottom what the hell 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.010
 here what does he do with his rayito 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.010
 and sequences 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.949
 it's not going to swallow me almost but well guys 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.379
 pretty quick departure as I said 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.990
 this mode to do so games 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:00.449
 lightning see 5 or 6 minutes out there 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.190
 raise on average between 4,000 and 5,000 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.020
 coins between each of your victories 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.550
 in this case take me double medalist 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.099
 out there assists because they continue 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.830
 assists was bursting and I think that 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.750
 It was the longest streak if so effectively 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.789
 what guys already know new new list 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.729
 of game combination between defeat by 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:19.979
 teams and defeat confirmed between a 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.509
 variation of several maps one variation 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.720
 of several maps because I always say 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:26.909
 Jesus Christ redundancies between what is 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.669
 several obviously have chosen maps 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:31.440
 like maps of the outskirts so go to 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.870
 a quite diverse modality could 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.550
 say it very well varied and to do 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.500
 games of this type lightning parties 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.419
 so nothing guys I think it's all 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.340
 from me for the video of today 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.050
 I really hope I enjoyed it 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.550
 forget to comment here in the part of 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.289
 below, what do you think if they have 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.909
 enjoyed and that they would like to continue 

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:50.039
 well in the channel remember the day of 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:52.080
 tomorrow video of the comic said milk 

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.449
 tomorrow we are going to burst with the consta 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.919
 but 

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:55.840
 It is already an issue that we will see on 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:57.699
 tomorrow for the moment I say goodbye 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.740
 for all of you and remember that the 

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:02.460
 I'll be watching until in a next video 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.460
 see you later
