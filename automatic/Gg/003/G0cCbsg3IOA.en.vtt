00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
part from the articulation so just

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.729 
part from the articulation so just
thread<00:03:25.459> for<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.090> wings<00:03:26.390> can<00:03:26.720> flap<00:03:27.500> up

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
thread for that the wings can flap up

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.720 
thread for that the wings can flap up
and<00:03:27.920> down<00:03:28.450> turn<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.750> side<00:03:30.220> as<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.519> show<00:03:31.700> you

and down turn to the side as I show you
the<00:03:31.850> tail<00:03:32.090> for<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.660> didn't<00:03:32.959> show<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.110> all

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the tail for but I didn't show you all

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.800 
the tail for but I didn't show you all
of<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.560> go<00:03:34.250> up<00:03:34.489> down<00:03:34.730> at<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.060> joint<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.570> can

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
of it go up down at this joint you can

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.310 
of it go up down at this joint you can
rotate<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:36.530> joint<00:03:36.830> rotated<00:03:37.459> this<00:03:37.610> joint

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
rotate this joint rotated this joint

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.240 
rotate this joint rotated this joint
then<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.799> legs<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.400> they<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:41.650> go<00:03:42.650> backwards

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
then the legs I they can go backwards

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.970 
then the legs I they can go backwards
now<00:03:43.519> they<00:03:43.940> can<00:03:44.060> kick<00:03:44.299> forwards<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:47.030> head

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
now they can kick forwards the head

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.539 
now they can kick forwards the head
articulated<00:03:48.980> goes<00:03:51.220> why<00:03:52.220> does<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.400> keep

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
articulated goes why does that keep

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:01.780 
articulated goes why does that keep
snapping<00:03:53.060> off<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:56.390> goes

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.619 

good<00:04:03.230> up<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:05.280> can<00:04:05.459> go<00:04:05.610> down<00:04:05.909> it<00:04:06.299> goes<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.599> a

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
good up it can go down it goes on a

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.410 
good up it can go down it goes on a
ratchet<00:04:07.080> joint<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.489> could<00:04:08.670> he<00:04:09.299> could

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
ratchet joint and it could he could

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.160 
ratchet joint and it could he could
twist<00:04:09.659> his<00:04:09.900> head<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:11.659> he<00:04:12.659> can<00:04:12.900> open

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
twist his head like that and he can open
