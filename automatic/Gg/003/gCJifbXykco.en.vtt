away and here after some thought and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.260 
away and here after some thought and
after<00:02:03.570> some<00:02:03.780> calculation<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.770> decided<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.030> play

it's not really damaged for me since it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's not really damaged for me since it

dangerously looking at the King side and
here<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.220> decided<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.090> castle<00:03:40.010> coincide<00:03:41.300> after

here I decided to castle coincide after
rook<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> see<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.470> course<00:03:43.709> I'm<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.980> moved

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
rook a to see one of course I'm I moved

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.240 
rook a to see one of course I'm I moved
my<00:03:44.660> king<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.959> b8<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:48.230> actually<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.769> main<00:03:49.920> idea

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
my king to b8 and actually the main idea

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.040 
my king to b8 and actually the main idea
of<00:03:50.400> black<00:03:50.610> here<00:03:51.060> should<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.690> f5<00:03:52.970> for<00:03:54.050> example

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
of black here should be f5 for example

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.620 
of black here should be f5 for example
here<00:03:55.440> when<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.860> white<00:03:56.130> plate<00:03:56.400> 90<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.090> f5

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
here when a white plate 90 to f5

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.320 
here when a white plate 90 to f5
probably<00:03:58.170> was<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.380> strongest<00:03:58.860> move<00:03:59.040> here<00:03:59.330> but

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
probably was the strongest move here but

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.220 
probably was the strongest move here but
I<00:04:01.250> noticed<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.430> very<00:04:02.640> nice<00:04:02.970> idea<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.840> clear

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
I noticed a very nice idea it's clear

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.340 
I noticed a very nice idea it's clear
that<00:04:04.260> white<00:04:04.830> wants<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:06.060> play<00:04:06.269> Knight<00:04:06.630> c4<00:04:07.140> and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
that white wants to play Knight c4 and

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.670 
that white wants to play Knight c4 and
probably<00:04:08.060> he<00:04:09.060> played<00:04:09.360> 92<00:04:10.049> with<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.380> idea<00:04:10.620> of

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
probably he played 92 with the idea of

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.720 
probably he played 92 with the idea of
Bishop<00:04:11.400> d6<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.970> play<00:04:12.680> 94<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:13.980> here<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.670> see

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
Bishop d6 to play 94 but here you see

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.000 
Bishop d6 to play 94 but here you see
that<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.209> replied<00:04:15.570> immediately<00:04:15.769> Bishop<00:04:16.769> takes

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
that I replied immediately Bishop takes

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.909 
that I replied immediately Bishop takes
h2<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.419> very<00:04:18.630> nice<00:04:18.840> trap<00:04:19.350> probably<00:04:19.890> a

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
h2 it's a very nice trap probably a

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.070 
h2 it's a very nice trap probably a
little<00:04:20.100> bit<00:04:20.780> blitz<00:04:21.780> trap<00:04:22.160> since<00:04:23.160> he<00:04:24.080> shouldn't

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
little bit blitz trap since he shouldn't

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.230 
little bit blitz trap since he shouldn't
have<00:04:25.140> played<00:04:25.530> 94<00:04:26.400> he<00:04:26.850> could
