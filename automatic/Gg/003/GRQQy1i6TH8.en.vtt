00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.330 
race and just wanna make it exciting so
what<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> did<00:00:33.300> over<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.500> 20<00:00:34.980> lat

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
what I did over like a you know 20 lat

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
what I did over like a you know 20 lat
right<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.940> know<00:00:36.059> 25<00:00:36.450> 10<00:00:36.660> races<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
right or you know 25 10 races and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
right or you know 25 10 races and
registered<00:00:37.800> say<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.520> would<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:39.180> easy

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
registered say it would be pretty easy

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
registered say it would be pretty easy
but<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.020> doing<00:00:40.590> over<00:00:40.829> three<00:00:40.980> laps<00:00:41.190> makes

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
but I think doing over three laps makes

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.880 
but I think doing over three laps makes
it<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.730> more<00:00:41.879> exciting<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.680> over<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it a bit more exciting so it over a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430 
it a bit more exciting so it over a
challenge<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> anyway<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.090> erm<00:00:45.440> let's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
challenge to it anyway that's erm let's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.040 
challenge to it anyway that's erm let's
go<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> lights<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.239> course<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
go when the lights go out of course so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.400 
go when the lights go out of course so
two<00:00:49.110> three<00:00:49.710> four<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.660> five<00:00:51.660> lights<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.350> out

two three four and five lights are out

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.560 
two three four and five lights are out
of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.590> way<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:53.039> go<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.370> Hungary<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:54.449> going

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of the way we go in Hungary we're going

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.760 
of the way we go in Hungary we're going
to<00:00:54.629> try<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.020> good<00:00:55.199> start<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.590> around

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to try get good start get around

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
to try get good start get around
children<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> obviously<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
children and obviously we are in a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.869 
children and obviously we are in a
Mercedes<00:00:57.840> which<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> fast<00:00:58.440> car<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.520> we'd

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
Mercedes which is a fast car so we'd

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
Mercedes which is a fast car so we'd
assume<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.449> good<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:01.980> we're

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
assume to be good but it's all we're

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
assume to be good but it's all we're
going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.430> about<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.059> trying<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
going to be about you know trying to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
going to be about you know trying to
maximize<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.350> opportunity<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.830> mean<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.189> them

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
maximize the opportunity I mean get them

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.340 
maximize the opportunity I mean get them
because<00:01:05.549> round<00:01:05.729> hungry<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.630> very<00:01:06.960> hard<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
because round hungry it's very hard to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
because round hungry it's very hard to
find<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> good<00:01:07.770> place<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.250> overtake<00:01:09.049> hitting

fast it's going to be pretty interesting

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590

between<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.760> two<00:02:13.880> towers<00:02:14.710> but<00:02:15.710> we're<00:02:15.860> going

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
between the two towers but we're going

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.150 
between the two towers but we're going
to<00:02:16.040> go<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.310> attack<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> button<00:02:17.330> straight<00:02:17.600> away

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
to go on attack a button straight away

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.310 
to go on attack a button straight away
hopefully<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.250> won't<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.520> too<00:02:20.200> defensive<00:02:21.200> and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
hopefully you won't be too defensive and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.950 
hopefully you won't be too defensive and
that's<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.220> p<00:02:22.370> 9<00:02:22.550> now<00:02:22.940> only<00:02:23.270> what<00:02:23.720> six

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's up to p 9 now only what six

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.290 
that's up to p 9 now only what six
positions<00:02:24.380> now<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.620> get<00:02:24.890> onto<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> podium<00:02:25.580> so

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
positions now to get onto the podium so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.820 
positions now to get onto the podium so
that<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:26.990> we<00:02:27.020> want<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.320> do<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.440> want<00:02:27.590> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
that is what we want to do we want to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.250 
that is what we want to do we want to
just<00:02:28.310> try<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.150> maximize<00:02:29.630> every<00:02:29.870> opportunity

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
just try and maximize every opportunity

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.580 
just try and maximize every opportunity
as<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.890> said<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.600> far<00:02:32.840> it's<00:02:33.080> looking<00:02:33.200> pretty

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
as I said and so far it's looking pretty

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.110 
as I said and so far it's looking pretty
good<00:02:33.800> but<00:02:34.430> it's<00:02:34.550> gonna<00:02:34.640> be<00:02:34.760> pretty<00:02:34.850> tight

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
good but it's gonna be pretty tight

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.730 
good but it's gonna be pretty tight
because<00:02:35.390> obviously<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.930> race<00:02:36.080> gets<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.620> no

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
because obviously the race gets you no

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.920 
because obviously the race gets you no
longer<00:02:37.520> as<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.030> race<00:02:38.180> goes<00:02:38.210> on<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.540> could<00:02:38.750> say

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
longer as the race goes on I could say

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.680 
longer as the race goes on I could say
it's<00:02:39.830> harder<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.280> harder<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.700> get<00:02:40.820> into<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's harder and harder to get into the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.300 
it's harder and harder to get into the
overtaking<00:02:42.290> opportunity<00:02:42.800> i'm<00:02:42.920> sticking

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
overtaking opportunity i'm sticking

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.740 
overtaking opportunity i'm sticking
after<00:02:43.490> i<00:02:43.520> would<00:02:43.610> take<00:02:43.790> Rosberg<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.600> into

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
after i would take Rosberg to go into

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.870 
after i would take Rosberg to go into
the<00:02:44.810> podium<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.700> might<00:02:46.850> be

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
the podium here so that might be

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.120 
the podium here so that might be
interesting<00:02:47.360> hopefully<00:02:47.540> no<00:02:47.840> lost<00:02:48.470> from<00:02:48.830> wings

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
interesting hopefully no lost from wings

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.610 
interesting hopefully no lost from wings
end<00:02:49.430> up<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.180> battle<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.490> skip<00:02:52.490> Groser<00:02:52.760> on

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
