00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.150
 add new comment on view of two today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.360
 not just about hackers in block 2 and yes 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.940
 I have a special here as in the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 mode entire blocks two celestial where 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 just as easy as a graphic artist 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.490
 So do not be surprised that she was 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.090
 always or cassandra here to date 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.740
 We'll show you this in the same way 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 once briefly two motion so he draws 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:38.489
 then then about there with times behind 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:40.829
 meanwhile, you can see flying moment 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.500
 there is someone really standing there and scoring 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.879
 exactly in the direction and yes so we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.879
 Now show it as an example 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.760
 I 'll do a little duplicate 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 speed but a little bit 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 how can its effect be 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 Steam account to post the description 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.439
 I would find great we place would 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.620
 if you have known pc games I have 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.050
 also apply some 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.870
 pc I would argue that 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.950
 he always has hassan every time 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.710
 came in and has an award in it 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.380
 this is triggered only on the body 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.490
 Most miss that, although extremely noticeable 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.460
 peter beckmann does not have the strength 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.600
 The keel fell and looks is real 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.110
 I find a weak performance 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.120
 what a pity 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.710
 yes, so I could use it for the most part 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.830
 Men dies it is one of the explosion 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.420
 and with that the question was why 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.550
 I have so bad with a round I have 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:52.240
 at the moment I try the special weapons 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:55.720
 so threw with crossbow crossbow 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.410
 complete as funny and beautiful on the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.410
 to peace and yes for that I have to stop 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.020
 and yes there are still some we are talking about it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.290
 a little sad that the game is up 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 pc is really crass hacker contaminated 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.880
 that still makes the game fun 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.780
 not on another hotel yet 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.100
 said but did with his tail 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.650
 the game broke, I do not understand 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.530
 You can still have fun when you look 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.660
 So I look at the kg so later on 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.519
 The End 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.400
 he has a 3.6 something kg always has 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.140
 only you're just a whiff of it 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.060
 Planting has already looked at everything 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.120
 I also have a few games and him 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:56.350
 looked at it is simply crass striking 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.630
 empty playing the once totally sad so 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220
 say that hackers are in every game 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.489
 taste tastes pretty good too 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.430
 good in front of the console for pc 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.489
 it is reasonably and on the console 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:22.560
 mostly prestige fields so spellbound 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:25.629
 not otherwise and also three now 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.670
 now here in the round seven 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.379
 Church effect on the plane 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.379
 to stand there and kill but only about 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.379
 all the markets it starkly noticeable 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.549
 Look at the comments you have too 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.440
 problem with hedges so will be two 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.760
 I make requests assisting them often 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.120
 that there is at least one hacker in the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.340
 Round is usually then so bad in 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.959
 but do not hedge that badly in the hack 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.440
 then most of the time you can do that 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:01.709
 still we get around that good 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.709
 but gameplay finds out easily despite 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:11.500
 Only very briefly I was in the rich 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.200
 Colleagues first not exactly 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 and there was the children still a forehand 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.810
 I also wanted to get in and feel good in myself 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:30.580
 mother and me so please we had 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:32.770
 the usa that activates the excuse 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.260
 yes we had the tour as anja 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.349
 is clear he has already at the beginning of the 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.349
 round 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.320
 not the worst player but me 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.860
 sad if i can actually 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.510
 my scores reasonably i can mine 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.960
 chance without hacks reach checker 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:04.520
 not German 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.860
 and maybe from companies like 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.060
 said at steam profile is the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.650
 description and that 's it with the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.850
 video game make big victories because 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.700
 I 'm so excited about the title 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.450
 have and / or in the new video 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.450
 bye bye
