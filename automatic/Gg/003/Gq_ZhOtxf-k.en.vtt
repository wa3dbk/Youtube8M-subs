for<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.949> decided<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> make<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.820> video

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.130 
for you so I decided to make this video
because<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.420> thought<00:00:18.570> there's<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:18.990> really

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
because I thought there's not really

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.439 
because I thought there's not really
much<00:00:19.949> videos<00:00:20.430> maybe<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:20.910> even<00:00:21.150> at<00:00:21.270> all

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
much videos maybe not even at all

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
much videos maybe not even at all
showing<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.619> aqua<00:00:22.920> blue<00:00:22.949> versus<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> flame

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
showing the aqua blue versus the flame

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
showing the aqua blue versus the flame

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
nice and let's look at the inside of it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
nice and let's look at the inside of it
now<00:01:24.110> okay

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
now okay

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.760 
now okay
smooth<00:01:26.160> reading<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.550> out<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:29.480> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
of a good look it's really shiny and can

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620 
of a good look it's really shiny and can

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
see the color it's really nice it's not

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.900 
see the color it's really nice it's not
as<00:01:39.750> reflective<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:40.980> here<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.550> on<00:01:41.700> top

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
as reflective right here that is on top

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.690 
as reflective right here that is on top
it<00:01:42.120> it<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:42.510> reflective<00:01:43.080> if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.700> see

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
it it is reflective if you can see

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.870 
it it is reflective if you can see
reflections<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.600> too<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.550> it's<00:01:47.550> really

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
reflections in it too and it's really

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.000
