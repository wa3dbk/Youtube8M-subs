Fireblade here at the Botanical Garden

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.929 
Fireblade here at the Botanical Garden
we<00:00:17.500> have<00:00:17.680> fire<00:00:17.920> blight<00:00:18.189> on<00:00:18.430> three<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.850> our

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
we have fire blight on three of our

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.000 
we have fire blight on three of our
fruit<00:00:19.180> trees<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.660> year<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.470> across<00:00:20.740> the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
fruit trees this year and across the

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.640 
fruit trees this year and across the
state<00:00:21.250> we<00:00:21.670> have<00:00:21.699> had<00:00:21.970> fire<00:00:22.180> bite<00:00:22.480> very<00:00:23.380> badly

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
state we have had fire bite very badly

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.399 
state we have had fire bite very badly
unfortunately<00:00:24.369> fire<00:00:25.269> blight<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:25.749> a<00:00:25.779> condition

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:26.409 
unfortunately fire blight is a condition

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.429 
unfortunately fire blight is a condition
where<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:26.949> bacteria<00:00:27.720> enters<00:00:28.720> into<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:29.019> tree

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
where the bacteria enters into a tree

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.910 
where the bacteria enters into a tree
and<00:00:29.769> it<00:00:30.070> overwinters<00:00:30.880> in<00:00:30.909> a<00:00:31.329> canker<00:00:31.839> this<00:00:32.710> is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
and it overwinters in a canker this is

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.430 
and it overwinters in a canker this is
actually<00:00:33.280> disease<00:00:33.700> part<00:00:34.239> right<00:00:34.720> here<00:00:35.200> and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
actually disease part right here and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.040 
actually disease part right here and
whereas<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.489> broken<00:00:36.940> area<00:00:37.270> is<00:00:37.450> broken<00:00:37.780> on<00:00:37.930> the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
whereas the broken area is broken on the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.410 
whereas the broken area is broken on the
bark<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:39.070> bacteria<00:00:39.580> stays<00:00:39.850> here<00:00:40.120> over

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
bark and the bacteria stays here over

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.650 
bark and the bacteria stays here over
winter<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:42.250> in<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.490> spring<00:00:42.790> as<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.180> tree<00:00:43.450> puts

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
winter then in a spring as the tree puts

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.740 
winter then in a spring as the tree puts
out<00:00:43.780> its<00:00:43.870> new<00:00:44.050> growth<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:45.220> it<00:00:45.910> also<00:00:46.060> uses<00:00:46.510> a

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
out its new growth the it also uses a

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.860 
out its new growth the it also uses a
tan<00:00:47.550> substance

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
tan substance

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.230 
tan substance
unfortunately<00:00:49.920> bees<00:00:50.920> insects<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.060> birds

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
unfortunately bees insects and birds

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.850 
unfortunately bees insects and birds
that<00:00:52.510> land<00:00:52.720> on<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:52.960> substance<00:00:53.380> then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
that land on this substance then

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.820 
that land on this substance then
accidentally<00:00:54.400> take<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:55.360> other<00:00:55.480> blooms<00:00:55.960> so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
accidentally take it to other blooms so

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.060 
accidentally take it to other blooms so
the<00:00:56.950> infections<00:00:57.550> are<00:00:57.880> mostly<00:00:58.330> seen<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:59.070> spring

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
the infections are mostly seen in spring

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.270 
the infections are mostly seen in spring
once<00:01:00.790> during<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.210> bloom<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.500> blooms<00:01:02.770> open

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
once during the bloom the blooms open

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.340 
once during the bloom the blooms open
they<00:01:03.910> look<00:01:04.150> fine

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
they look fine

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.219 
they look fine
the<00:01:06.150> pollination<00:01:07.150> Zoar<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> pollinators

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
the pollination Zoar the pollinators

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.780 
the pollination Zoar the pollinators
bring<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.560> actually<00:01:08.860> into<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.159> bloom<00:01:09.490> and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
bring it actually into the bloom and

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.600 
bring it actually into the bloom and
therefore<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.900> infection<00:01:11.350> starts<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:12.520> will

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
therefore the infection starts you will

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.760 
therefore the infection starts you will
then<00:01:12.820> see<00:01:13.150> in<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.870> couple<00:01:13.990> weeks<00:01:14.290> sometimes<00:01:14.620> a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
then see in a couple weeks sometimes a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.110 
then see in a couple weeks sometimes a
couple<00:01:14.980> days<00:01:15.130> in<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.370> couple<00:01:15.520> weeks<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:16.000> will

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
couple days in a couple weeks you will

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.600 
couple days in a couple weeks you will
see<00:01:16.240> this<00:01:16.390> blackened<00:01:16.990> or<00:01:17.170> darkened<00:01:18.130> leaves

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
see this blackened or darkened leaves

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.360 
see this blackened or darkened leaves
and<00:01:19.180> whole<00:01:19.900> structure<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.560> sometimes<00:01:21.130> black

and<00:01:21.580> fruit<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.450> an<00:01:22.690> Asian<00:01:23.050> pear<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
and fruit this is an Asian pear this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.870 
and fruit this is an Asian pear this
disease<00:01:25.479> then<00:01:25.780> continues<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.409> live<00:01:26.860> in<00:01:27.310> the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
disease then continues to live in the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.600 
disease then continues to live in the
bark<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.830> overwinter<00:01:29.830> next<00:01:30.130> year<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.400> start

bark and overwinter next year and start

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.140 
bark and overwinter next year and start
again<00:01:31.830> here<00:01:32.830> at<00:01:32.920> Oklahoma<00:01:33.040> State<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.909> is<00:01:34.060> it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
again here at Oklahoma State this is it

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.539 
again here at Oklahoma State this is it
our<00:01:34.240> agent<00:01:34.570> pair<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:34.990> disease<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.890> then<00:01:36.400> we

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
our agent pair this disease and then we

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.950 
our agent pair this disease and then we
have<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> couple<00:01:37.180> other<00:01:37.299> trees<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.870> are

have a couple other trees that are

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.550 
have a couple other trees that are
diseased

cutting back all the way for the disease

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.679 
cutting back all the way for the disease
I<00:02:06.630> would<00:02:07.630> go<00:02:07.990> ahead<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.349> cut<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:08.950> back<00:02:09.689> follow

I would go ahead and cut it back follow

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.649 
I would go ahead and cut it back follow
my<00:02:11.019> disease<00:02:11.379> was<00:02:11.620> here<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.220> here<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:12.939> I<00:02:13.480> would

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
my disease was here and here and I would

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.630 
my disease was here and here and I would
actually<00:02:14.049> cut<00:02:14.260> back<00:02:14.500> since<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:14.950> 12<00:02:15.220> inches

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
actually cut back since it's 12 inches

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.589 
actually cut back since it's 12 inches
lower<00:02:15.910> than<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.270> most<00:02:17.020> recent<00:02:18.480> infection

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
lower than the most recent infection

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.179 
lower than the most recent infection
there's<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.049> down<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.650> would<00:02:20.769> have<00:02:21.040> to

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
there's one down here so I would have to

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.520 
there's one down here so I would have to
cut<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.489> back<00:02:21.609> way<00:02:21.939> back<00:02:22.180> here<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.409> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
cut it back way back here so in the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.379 
cut it back way back here so in the
wintertime<00:02:23.889> I'm<00:02:24.430> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> come<00:02:24.939> back<00:02:24.969> and

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
wintertime I'm going to come back and

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.629 
wintertime I'm going to come back and
actually<00:02:25.480> cut<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.049> tree<00:02:26.349> way<00:02:27.129> back<00:02:27.340> here

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
actually cut that tree way back here

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.390 
actually cut that tree way back here
since<00:02:28.329> we<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.260> disease<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.099> whole

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
since we have this disease in this whole

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520 
since we have this disease in this whole
tree<00:02:30.909> we<00:02:31.540> would<00:02:31.659> actually<00:02:31.810> end<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.290> cutting

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
tree we would actually end up cutting

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.220 
tree we would actually end up cutting
all<00:02:32.889> of<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.510> scaffolding<00:02:34.510> or<00:02:34.689> all<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:35.019> main

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
all of the scaffolding or all these main

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.399 
all of the scaffolding or all these main
branches<00:02:35.799> back<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.879> base<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.019> we<00:02:38.230> will

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
branches back at the base so we will

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.319 
branches back at the base so we will
probably<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.280> face<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.609> decision<00:02:40.209> of

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
probably have to face a decision of

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.050 
probably have to face a decision of
removing<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.840> tree<00:02:41.049> or<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:42.040> top<00:02:42.340> working<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
removing this tree or of top working and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.490 
removing this tree or of top working and
trying<00:02:43.359> to<00:02:43.480> find<00:02:43.659> disease<00:02:44.049> resistant

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
trying to find disease resistant

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.190 
trying to find disease resistant
varieties<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.099> will<00:02:45.459> actually<00:02:45.840> graft<00:02:46.840> on

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
varieties that will actually graft on

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.149 
varieties that will actually graft on
top<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.680> those<00:02:47.769> in<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.040> early<00:02:48.280> spring<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:50.159> our

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
top of those in the early spring so our

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.009 
top of those in the early spring so our
biggest<00:02:51.400> control<00:02:51.849> measures<00:02:52.150> are<00:02:52.419> disease

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
biggest control measures are disease

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.270 
biggest control measures are disease
resistant<00:02:53.620> varieties<00:02:54.159> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.510> our<00:02:56.280> pink

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
resistant varieties this is our pink

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.270 
resistant varieties this is our pink
lady<00:02:57.579> supreme<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.569> was<00:02:58.780> planted<00:02:59.049> in<00:02:59.409> 2014

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
lady supreme it was planted in 2014

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.309 
lady supreme it was planted in 2014
early<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.699> spring<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.209> his<00:03:01.750> very<00:03:02.049> first

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
early this spring and his very first

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.099 
early this spring and his very first
bloom<00:03:02.799> got<00:03:03.370> Fireblade<00:03:03.969> and<00:03:04.180> their<00:03:04.629> very<00:03:04.840> top

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
bloom got Fireblade and their very top

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.689 
bloom got Fireblade and their very top
died<00:03:05.439> back<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.949> the<00:03:06.010> first<00:03:06.189> set<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.489> leaves

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:06.699 
died back and the first set of leaves

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.390 
died back and the first set of leaves
died<00:03:07.030> back<00:03:07.799> unfortunately<00:03:08.799> we<00:03:08.949> sent<00:03:09.159> it<00:03:09.250> to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
died back unfortunately we sent it to

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.770 
died back unfortunately we sent it to
the<00:03:09.519> plant<00:03:09.760> pathology<00:03:10.180> lab<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.510> they<00:03:10.569> said

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
the plant pathology lab and they said

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.689 
the plant pathology lab and they said
yes<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.260> Fireblade<00:03:11.799> go<00:03:12.189> ahead<00:03:12.519> and

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
yes you have Fireblade go ahead and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.420 
yes you have Fireblade go ahead and
remove<00:03:12.819> 12<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.480> 14<00:03:13.900> inches<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:15.099> we<00:03:15.129> actually

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
remove 12 to 14 inches so we actually

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.059 
remove 12 to 14 inches so we actually
cut<00:03:15.879> it<00:03:16.000> back<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.659> actually<00:03:17.019> it's<00:03:17.739> doing

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
cut it back and actually it's doing

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.099 
cut it back and actually it's doing
really<00:03:18.280> well<00:03:18.549> now<00:03:18.750> unfortunately<00:03:19.750> this

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
really well now unfortunately this

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.459 
really well now unfortunately this
variety<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.730> susceptible<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.760> fire<00:03:22.060> blight

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.469 
variety is susceptible to fire blight

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.990 
variety is susceptible to fire blight
and<00:03:23.469> then<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:23.829> is<00:03:24.040> our<00:03:24.129> apple<00:03:24.549> tree<00:03:24.790> that

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
and then this is our apple tree that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.819 
and then this is our apple tree that
also<00:03:25.419> got<00:03:25.569> fired<00:03:25.840> by<00:03:26.079> this<00:03:26.139> is<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.379> Fuji<00:03:26.799> apple

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
also got fired by this is a Fuji apple

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.890 
also got fired by this is a Fuji apple
and<00:03:27.519> they're<00:03:27.639> also<00:03:27.849> highly<00:03:28.239> susceptible<00:03:28.569> to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
and they're also highly susceptible to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.099 
and they're also highly susceptible to
fire<00:03:29.199> blight<00:03:29.439> and<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:31.269> here<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:31.989> can

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
fire blight and it's here we can

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.740 
fire blight and it's here we can
actually<00:03:32.379> really<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:32.680> how<00:03:33.129> the<00:03:33.189> disease

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
actually really see how the disease

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.289 
actually really see how the disease
entered<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:35.049> bloom<00:03:35.650> out<00:03:35.829> here<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.400> traveled

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
entered a bloom out here and traveled

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.670 
entered a bloom out here and traveled
all<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.629> way<00:03:37.659> down<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.810> main<00:03:41.169> branch

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
all the way down the to a main branch

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.979 
all the way down the to a main branch
and<00:03:42.280> then<00:03:42.639> that<00:03:42.849> follows<00:03:43.269> all<00:03:43.479> the<00:03:43.629> way<00:03:43.689> back

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
and then that follows all the way back

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.170 
and then that follows all the way back
and<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.590> same<00:03:44.799> thing<00:03:45.040> with<00:03:45.189> this<00:03:45.400> one<00:03:45.639> if<00:03:45.819> we

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
and the same thing with this one if we

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.699 
and the same thing with this one if we
follow<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:48.180> disease<00:03:49.180> all<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.780> way<00:03:49.840> back<00:03:50.169> we

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
follow the disease all the way back we

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.259 
follow the disease all the way back we
actually<00:03:51.099> come<00:03:51.250> back<00:03:51.400> here<00:03:51.669> and<00:03:51.849> we<00:03:51.939> actually

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
actually come back here and we actually

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.020 
actually come back here and we actually
have<00:03:52.419> disease<00:03:52.689> on<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:52.959> trunk<00:03:53.409> so<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.579> apple

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
have disease on the trunk so this apple

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.659 
have disease on the trunk so this apple
tree<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.359> going<00:03:55.599> to<00:03:55.689> have<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.019> be<00:03:56.109> removed

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
tree is going to have to be removed

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.619 
tree is going to have to be removed
number<00:03:57.669> one<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:58.000> has<00:03:58.120> had<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.389> disease

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
number one and has had the disease

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.869 
number one and has had the disease
multiple<00:03:59.169> years<00:03:59.349> in<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.560> row<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.009> number<00:04:00.609> two

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
multiple years in a row and number two

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.999 
multiple years in a row and number two
the<00:04:01.090> disease<00:04:01.389> is<00:04:01.629> systemic<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:02.500> all<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.919> way

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
the disease is systemic it's all the way

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.289 
the disease is systemic it's all the way
throughout<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.400> whole<00:04:03.790> tree<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:05.819> we<00:04:06.819> will

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
throughout the whole tree and we will

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.999 
throughout the whole tree and we will
need<00:04:07.509> to<00:04:07.689> do<00:04:07.870> something<00:04:08.199> about<00:04:08.319> that

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
need to do something about that

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.300 
need to do something about that
so<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:10.060> terms<00:04:10.599> of<00:04:10.840> prevention<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.949> biggest

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
so in terms of prevention the biggest

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.640 
so in terms of prevention the biggest
part<00:04:12.579> is<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.939> actually<00:04:13.509> buy<00:04:14.259> disease

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
part is to actually buy disease

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.189 
part is to actually buy disease
resistant<00:04:15.099> varieties<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:16.150> second<00:04:16.659> thing<00:04:16.900> is

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
resistant varieties the second thing is

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.560 
resistant varieties the second thing is
even<00:04:17.889> if<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.250> buy<00:04:18.400> desisting<00:04:18.849> resistant

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
even if you buy desisting resistant

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.990 
even if you buy desisting resistant
varieties<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.620> may<00:04:20.829> still<00:04:21.130> get<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.639> disease

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
varieties you may still get the disease

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.050 
varieties you may still get the disease
the<00:04:22.960> most<00:04:23.139> common<00:04:23.620> time<00:04:24.039> is<00:04:24.370> at<00:04:24.610> bloom<00:04:24.820> time

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the most common time is at bloom time

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.860 
the most common time is at bloom time
and<00:04:25.360> then<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:26.130> 75<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.340> 85<00:04:27.789> degrees<00:04:27.870> during

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
and then it's 75 to 85 degrees during

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.850 
and then it's 75 to 85 degrees during
the<00:04:29.020> daytime<00:04:29.409> humid<00:04:30.310> rainy<00:04:30.610> weather<00:04:30.940> and

the daytime humid rainy weather and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.540 
the daytime humid rainy weather and
oftentimes<00:04:32.860> hail

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
oftentimes hail

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.249 
oftentimes hail
can<00:04:33.940> actually<00:04:34.210> be<00:04:34.300> if<00:04:34.479> there's<00:04:34.660> an<00:04:34.750> injury<00:04:34.930> to
