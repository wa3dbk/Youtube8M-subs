00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.670
 gel nails themselves and girlfriends quickly and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.069
 easy 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.219
 I have a completely ordinary inexpensive 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.360
 Forms I processed the nail plate both 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.090
 regretted her now presenting the shape of it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.820
 completely ordinary technique is not salon 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.820
 non arched ordinary home appliances 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 I saw that everything was close to me 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 and exactly 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.220
 now i'm taking an artificial brush for 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.220
 gel number 4 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.940
 the jars are picking up a little drop and 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.410
 rubbing movements distributing it to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.660
 natural nail plate 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.290
 not reaching the cuticle and side rollers 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.290
 one millimeter 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.250
 about 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.510
 then I take a bit more in size 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.990
 with a bead like that 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.990
 pulling gel 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.000
 and form a square free edge 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 nail coming a little on the natural 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.210
 plate 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.820
 and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.450
 if necessary i press the form again me 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.090
 everything suits and in the lamp 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.689
 two minutes later I take off the form very 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.689
 neatly 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.050
 wiping a sticky layer 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.470
 I take any tough nail file for 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.900
 artificial nails and start 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.310
 filing form very neat nail 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.300
 the plate is still thin 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 remove dust 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 on the brush I type a little again 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.940
 drop and spread all over the nail 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.830
 thin layer to the next 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.830
 the caprica slid on it better 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.300
 I take a big drop distributed by 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.080
 the center of the nail and the following movements I 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.030
 I distribute the gel, he spreads himself 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.850
 self-leveling throughout the rest 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.700
 surface of the nail plate as soon as 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.030
 I made sure that the apex was formed and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.840
 Arochka and a smooth transition there I put 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.840
 nail mom 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.770
 two minutes later I take off the sticky layer 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.260
 in order to saw keel 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.020
 imperfections nails and form design 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.440

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.390

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.900
