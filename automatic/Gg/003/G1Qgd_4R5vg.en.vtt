00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
it's not that thin I mean I do have

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
it's not that thin I mean I do have
quite<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.070> hair<00:00:32.219> more<00:00:32.430> than<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> used<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
quite a lot of hair more than I used to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.250 
quite a lot of hair more than I used to
when<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.719> my<00:00:33.870> hair<00:00:34.020> used<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> be

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
when I was little my hair used to be

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.400 
when I was little my hair used to be
really<00:00:34.500> thin<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.719> it<00:00:36.719> doesn't<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> lot<00:00:37.380> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
really thin and it doesn't have a lot of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
really thin and it doesn't have a lot of
volume<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.219> hair<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.610> similar<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
volume so if your hair is similar to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
volume so if your hair is similar to
mine<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.719> respect<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.739> should

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
mine in that respect then this should

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
mine in that respect then this should
work<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:41.940> my<00:00:42.090> hair<00:00:42.329> lacks

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
work for you because my hair lacks

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.619 
work for you because my hair lacks
volume<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.469> can't<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:44.219> pull<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:44.969> hair<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.450> into

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
volume I can't just pull my hair up into

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
volume I can't just pull my hair up into
and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.980> top<00:00:47.219> knot<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.850> really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and you sort of want to aim for the very

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.610 
and you sort of want to aim for the very
top<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.060> your<00:02:16.240> head<00:02:16.510> because<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:17.050> don't<00:02:17.500> know

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
falls backwards and then you want to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.720 
falls backwards and then you want to
sort<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.160> gather<00:02:24.760> all<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> hair<00:02:26.400> sort<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.520> wrap

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
sort of gather all the hair sort of wrap

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.470 
sort of gather all the hair sort of wrap
it<00:02:27.880> around<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.210> an<00:02:28.330> odd<00:02:28.450> sort<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.870> way<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
it around in an odd sort of way and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.890 
it around in an odd sort of way and
secure<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.660> with<00:02:31.690> your<00:02:32.020> hair<00:02:32.230> tie

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.360 

and<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.560> should<00:02:39.709> end<00:02:39.860> up<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:40.069> something

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
and you should end up with something

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.089 
and you should end up with something
like<00:02:40.549> this<00:02:41.409> it<00:02:42.409> doesn't<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:42.769> look<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
like this it doesn't really look that

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.410 
like this it doesn't really look that
great<00:02:43.430> at<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.849> moment<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.090> mean<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.299> could

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
great at the moment I mean you could

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.479 
great at the moment I mean you could
leave<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.780> like<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:45.709> I'm<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
leave it like this but now I'm going to

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.460 
leave it like this but now I'm going to
pull<00:02:47.060> out<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.069> hair<00:02:49.069> on<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.610> top<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:51.319> I'm

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
pull out the hair on the top and I'm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.520 
pull out the hair on the top and I'm
going<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.620> sort<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.860> reshape<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:53.170> into<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> bun

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
going to sort of reshape it into a bun

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.830 
going to sort of reshape it into a bun
and<00:02:54.790> before<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:55.819> secure<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.359> with<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.659> brick

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and before I secure that with a brick

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.880 
and before I secure that with a brick
I'm<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.109> to<00:02:57.260> pull<00:02:57.379> out<00:02:57.409> hair<00:02:57.739> at<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:57.920> sides

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
I'm going to pull out hair at the sides

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.530 
I'm going to pull out hair at the sides
bits<00:03:00.890> do<00:03:01.129> fall<00:03:01.400> out<00:03:01.579> like<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:01.909> because<00:03:02.209> my

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
bits do fall out like this because my

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.509 
bits do fall out like this because my
hair<00:03:02.689> is<00:03:02.720> short<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.290> can<00:03:03.439> just<00:03:03.560> go<00:03:04.310> back<00:03:04.340> and

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
hair is short so we can just go back and

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.670 
hair is short so we can just go back and
pin<00:03:04.819> them<00:03:04.970> back<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.390> minute<00:03:05.599> I'm<00:03:06.470> going<00:03:06.590> to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
pin them back in a minute I'm going to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.009 
pin them back in a minute I'm going to
take<00:03:06.829> hair<00:03:07.099> grips<00:03:07.280> again<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.909> pin<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.810> bun

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
take hair grips again and pin the bun

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:30.650 
take hair grips again and pin the bun
into<00:03:09.439> shape

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.060 

and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.380> when<00:03:31.500> you've<00:03:31.620> done<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:32.010> can

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
and then when you've done that you can

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.950 
and then when you've done that you can
go<00:03:32.430> ahead<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.910> clip<00:03:33.180> up<00:03:33.360> any<00:03:33.570> bits<00:03:33.810> at<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
go ahead and clip up any bits at the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.780 
go ahead and clip up any bits at the
sides<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.740> can<00:03:34.800> carry<00:03:35.130> on<00:03:35.220> put<00:03:35.460> in<00:03:35.580> but<00:03:35.730> be

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
sides you can carry on put in but be

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.300 
sides you can carry on put in but be
gentle<00:03:36.120> because<00:03:36.710> you<00:03:37.710> have<00:03:37.890> pinned<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
gentle because you have pinned in the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.000 
gentle because you have pinned in the
top<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.570> as<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.870> can<00:03:40.050> see<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.410> whole<00:03:40.830> bit

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
top so as you can see this whole bit

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.320 
top so as you can see this whole bit
here<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.340> falling<00:03:41.610> down<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.210> quite

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
here is falling down but it's quite

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.280 
here is falling down but it's quite
short<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.260> I'm<00:03:43.350> just<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.770> take<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:45.290> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
short so I'm just going to take that and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.590 
short so I'm just going to take that and
to<00:03:46.380> pin<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.590> back<00:03:46.800> up<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:49.790> you're<00:03:50.790> done<00:03:50.940> there

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
to pin it back up and you're done there

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.850 
to pin it back up and you're done there
are<00:03:51.690> also<00:03:51.840> some<00:03:52.050> other<00:03:52.230> things<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.680> do

like what I like to do is pull out some

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.700 
like what I like to do is pull out some
little<00:03:56.520> bits<00:03:56.670> here<00:03:57.320> makes<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.440> look<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.680> bit

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
little bits here makes it look a bit

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.550 
little bits here makes it look a bit
Messier<00:03:59.660> I'd<00:04:00.660> quite<00:04:00.870> like<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.320> little

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
Messier I'd quite like to have little

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
Messier I'd quite like to have little
bits<00:04:01.710> hanging<00:04:01.890> down<00:04:02.220> another<00:04:02.940> thing<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.150> can

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
bits hanging down another thing you can

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.240 
bits hanging down another thing you can
do<00:04:03.570> once<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.960> finish<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.040> can

do once you finish this is that you can

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.960 
do once you finish this is that you can
add<00:04:05.520> head<00:04:06.480> scoffs<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.320> is<00:04:07.560> just<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.040> square

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
add head scoffs this is just a square

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.230 
add head scoffs this is just a square
heads<00:04:09.300> graph<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.840> have<00:04:10.170> folded<00:04:10.890> and

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
heads graph that I have folded and

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.479 
heads graph that I have folded and
wrapped<00:04:12.240> up<00:04:12.480> like<00:04:13.050> this<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:17.040> what<00:04:17.400> you're
