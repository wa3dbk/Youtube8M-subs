about the city's engine is whether

about the city's engine is whether

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
you're nipping in and out of city

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.330 
you're nipping in and out of city
traffic<00:03:39.140> or<00:03:39.680> you're<00:03:39.799> cruising<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.280> the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
traffic or you're cruising on the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.930 
traffic or you're cruising on the
highway

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
highway

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.199 
highway
it<00:03:41.000> seems<00:03:41.540> comfortable<00:03:42.200> anywhere<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:44.060> only

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
it seems comfortable anywhere the only

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.360 
it seems comfortable anywhere the only
thing<00:03:44.480> one<00:03:44.659> finds<00:03:44.959> is<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.500> city<00:03:45.769> is<00:03:45.980> not

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
thing one finds is that the city is not

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.399 
thing one finds is that the city is not
as<00:03:46.579> well<00:03:46.790> insulated<00:03:47.180> as<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.780> other<00:03:47.930> two<00:03:48.140> cars

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
as well insulated as the other two cars

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.009 
as well insulated as the other two cars
so<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.650> lot<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.250> road<00:03:49.489> noise<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.180> engine

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
so a lot of the road noise and engine

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.289 
so a lot of the road noise and engine
noise<00:03:51.170> tends<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.040> filter<00:03:52.430> through<00:03:52.579> into<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
noise tends to filter through into the

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:00.190 
noise tends to filter through into the
cabin<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:59.239> city<00:03:59.480> has<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.750> weight<00:04:00.019> advantage

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
cabin the city has a weight advantage

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.170 
cabin the city has a weight advantage
and<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.859> helps<00:04:01.160> in<00:04:01.280> making<00:04:01.579> it<00:04:01.700> sprightly

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and this helps in making it sprightly

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.050 
and this helps in making it sprightly
the<00:04:02.659> winter<00:04:03.019> width<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.319> 1.6<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.730> biggest

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
the winter width is 1.6 is the biggest

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.949 
the winter width is 1.6 is the biggest

now<00:06:55.420> this<00:06:55.780> is<00:06:55.930> a<00:06:55.960> segment<00:06:56.230> where<00:06:56.440> fuel

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
now this is a segment where fuel

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.440 
now this is a segment where fuel
efficiency<00:06:57.280> is<00:06:57.400> still<00:06:57.610> important<00:06:58.090> so<00:06:58.240> let's

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
efficiency is still important so let's

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:08.550 
efficiency is still important so let's
take<00:06:58.660> a<00:06:58.690> look<00:06:58.870> at<00:06:59.170> the<00:06:59.380> figures<00:07:07.290> this<00:07:08.290> is

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
take a look at the figures this is

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.760 
take a look at the figures this is
really<00:07:09.160> where<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.550> city<00:07:09.850> excels

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770
