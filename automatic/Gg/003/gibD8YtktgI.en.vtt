it I could work do what I want because
I'm<00:00:29.750> controlling<00:00:30.500> his<00:00:30.680> hand<00:00:30.920> in<00:00:31.010> controlling

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
I'm controlling his hand in controlling

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.979 
I'm controlling his hand in controlling
his<00:00:31.430> posture<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:32.480> way<00:00:32.629> gel<00:00:32.840> solution

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
his posture so this way gel solution

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.140 
his posture so this way gel solution
that<00:00:33.860> what<00:00:34.040> I'm<00:00:34.130> going<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:34.280> do<00:00:34.400> is<00:00:34.550> basically

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
that what I'm going to do is basically

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.580 
that what I'm going to do is basically
as<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.570> got<00:00:35.750> this<00:00:35.870> grip<00:00:36.079> I<00:00:36.200> think<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.440> natural

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
as you got this grip I think the natural

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.200 
as you got this grip I think the natural
tendency<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.130> actually<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.579> try<00:00:37.880> straighten

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
tendency is actually the try straighten

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.389 
tendency is actually the try straighten
up<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.420> avoid<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.750> knee<00:00:38.900> in<00:00:39.560> this<00:00:39.739> case<00:00:40.010> I'm

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
up and avoid the knee in this case I'm

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.220 
up and avoid the knee in this case I'm
going<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.640> basically<00:00:40.820> simply<00:00:41.180> press<00:00:41.570> this

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
going to basically simply press this

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.460 
going to basically simply press this
joint<00:00:42.530> lock<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.220> in<00:00:43.370> drive<00:00:44.120> my<00:00:44.660> shoulder<00:00:45.079> this

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
joint lock it in drive my shoulder this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.040 
joint lock it in drive my shoulder this
way<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:46.160> basically<00:00:46.340> drive<00:00:46.670> an<00:00:46.880> elbow<00:00:47.210> inward

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
way to basically drive an elbow inward

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.960 
way to basically drive an elbow inward
and<00:00:48.320> I<00:00:48.559> should<00:00:48.770> rest<00:00:49.010> almost<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.670> know<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:49.790> mean

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
and I should rest almost you know I mean

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.959 
and I should rest almost you know I mean
so<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:50.720> basically<00:00:51.620> wrestle<00:00:52.220> so<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.520> idea<00:00:52.760> is

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
so so basically wrestle so the idea is

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.840 
so so basically wrestle so the idea is

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.540 
you're not actually to have a light
distance<00:00:57.200> so<00:00:57.680> I'm<00:00:57.739> going<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:57.950> do<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.130> again

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
distance so I'm going to do it again

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.520 
distance so I'm going to do it again
press<00:00:59.300> drive

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530
