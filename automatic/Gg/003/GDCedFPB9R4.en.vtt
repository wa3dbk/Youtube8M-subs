my<00:00:08.940> tree<00:00:09.179> ologist<00:00:09.540> out<00:00:09.719> there<00:00:09.870> these<00:00:10.019> are

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
my tree ologist out there these are

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.410 
my tree ologist out there these are
conifers<00:00:10.769> not<00:00:11.070> Aspen's<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.150> my<00:00:12.269> mistake

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
conifers not Aspen's that was my mistake

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.419 
conifers not Aspen's that was my mistake
I<00:00:12.840> was<00:00:13.139> looking<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:13.559> Aspen's<00:00:13.980> before<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I was looking at some Aspen's before I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
I was looking at some Aspen's before I
place<00:00:14.880> these<00:00:15.089> conifers<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:15.690> anyway<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.289> we're

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
place these conifers but anyway so we're

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
place these conifers but anyway so we're
gonna<00:00:16.470> check<00:00:16.680> out<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> folded<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:17.520> retracted

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
gonna check out the folded or retracted

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.029 
gonna check out the folded or retracted
hulsey<00:00:18.600> today<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> consider<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> first

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
hulsey today what I consider the first

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.310 
hulsey today what I consider the first
of<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> big<00:00:20.520> hole<00:00:20.880> series<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.140> B<00:00:22.289> are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
of the big hole series the a and B are

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.980 
of the big hole series the a and B are
definitely<00:00:22.920> more<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> starter

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
definitely more of like the starter

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.509 
definitely more of like the starter

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
is the first big cargo mover in the

is the first big cargo mover in the
verse<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.490> far<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.240> concerned<00:00:30.269> unless<00:00:30.810> you

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
verse as far as I'm concerned unless you

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.780 
verse as far as I'm concerned unless you
put<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.380> against<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> whole<00:00:31.949> d<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
put it up against the whole d then it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.450 
put it up against the whole d then it's
not<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.210> big<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.980> retracted<00:00:35.989> folded

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
not so big this is the retracted folded

not so big this is the retracted folded
compacted<00:00:38.460> flight<00:00:38.820> mode<00:00:39.090> whatever<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
compacted flight mode whatever you like

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
compacted flight mode whatever you like
to<00:00:39.660> call<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> hole<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.379> over<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> it

to call it hole see over here and it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
to call it hole see over here and it
comes<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:41.940> around<00:00:42.059> fifty<00:00:42.870> nine<00:00:43.020> meters<00:00:43.410> the

comes in at around fifty nine meters the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.040 
comes in at around fifty nine meters the
same<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> connie<00:00:44.399> taurus<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.870> give<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
same as the connie taurus and to give a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.709 
same as the connie taurus and to give a
little<00:00:46.170> size<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.640> main<00:00:48.090> thrusters<00:00:48.570> i

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
little size to those main thrusters i

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.049 
little size to those main thrusters i
put<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.680> star<00:00:50.190> citizen<00:00:50.579> model<00:00:50.879> down

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
put our little star citizen model down

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.979 
put our little star citizen model down
there<00:00:51.590> very<00:00:52.590> large<00:00:52.890> main<00:00:53.190> thrusters<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:54.719> as

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
there very large main thrusters but as

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
there very large main thrusters but as
far<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> link<00:00:55.620> goes<00:00:55.860> remember<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
far as the link goes remember that is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
far as the link goes remember that is
just<00:00:56.760> my<00:00:56.910> best<00:00:57.239> guess<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> no

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
just my best guess there is no

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470 
just my best guess there is no
documentation<00:00:58.500> yet<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> retracted

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
documentation yet on what the retracted

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
documentation yet on what the retracted
length<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> also<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> believe<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.550> main

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
length is and also I believe the main

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
length is and also I believe the main
thruster<00:01:03.390> cluster<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.350> main

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
thruster cluster back there main

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
thruster cluster back there main
thruster<00:01:05.250> cluster<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.439> tighter

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
thruster cluster will be a in a tighter

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.760 
thruster cluster will be a in a tighter
configuration<00:01:08.460> once<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.619> retracted<00:01:10.619> so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
configuration once it is retracted so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.480 
configuration once it is retracted so
the<00:01:11.280> whole<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:13.080> compacted<00:01:14.010> flight<00:01:14.250> mode

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the whole see as a compacted flight mode

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.380 
the whole see as a compacted flight mode
is<00:01:14.700> still<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> rather<00:01:15.630> large<00:01:16.439> ship<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.390> larger

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
is still a rather large ship and larger

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
is still a rather large ship and larger
so<00:01:18.630> than<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> thought<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.040> when

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so than what I thought it would be when

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.649 
so than what I thought it would be when
I<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> island<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
I first put on the island I was kind of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.530 
I first put on the island I was kind of
shocked<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.799> mass<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> folded

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
shocked about the mass of the folded

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
shocked about the mass of the folded
whole<00:01:24.750> seat<00:01:25.049> especially<00:01:26.040> compared<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
whole seat especially compared to a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 
whole seat especially compared to a
Connie<00:01:27.270> Taurus<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.890> month<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.250> two

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Connie Taurus which just a month or two

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039 
Connie Taurus which just a month or two
ago<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.810> good

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
ago was this you know a pretty good

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.810 
ago was this you know a pretty good
sized<00:01:31.320> ship<00:01:31.650> something<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.670> me

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
sized ship something that's got me

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.310 
sized ship something that's got me
really<00:01:32.850> curious<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:33.869> they're<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
really curious is how they're going to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.340 
really curious is how they're going to
work<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> bridge<00:01:35.150> it's<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> compared<00:01:37.259> to

work the bridge it's a it compared to
the<00:01:37.470> tourists<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> pretty<00:01:38.820> large<00:01:39.119> bridge

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the tourists it's a pretty large bridge

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
the tourists it's a pretty large bridge
a<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:40.470> large<00:01:40.680> viewing<00:01:41.070> window<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
a very large viewing window I know the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
a very large viewing window I know the
spine<00:01:42.689> has<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.229> retract<00:01:43.619> inside<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.579> body

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
spine has to retract inside the body

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.450 
spine has to retract inside the body
once<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.899> closed<00:01:46.200> position<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.979> if

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
once it's in this closed position but if
