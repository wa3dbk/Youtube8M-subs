 access 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.010
 logic than to imagine 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.960
 Moscow is the most effective 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.810
 reliability sharp decline of course 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.900
 vehicle 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.599
 such as cars and motorcycles boats 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.809
 and how model acts all that matters 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.619
 term value 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.769
 called may law 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.499
 key feature of the device 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.879
 is her job opportunity 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.439
 sleep mode 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.290
 wake up a certain time 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.150
 the order determines its coordinates by 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.420
 Essentially press 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.300
 country director 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.020
 and sent their coordinates sms 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.340
 messages of its owner 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.510
 why fall asleep 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.760
 after which Georgia 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.060
 what allows to be given 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.180
 deficiencies 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.540
 to save energy 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.540
 for autonomous work 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.950
 further demonstrate by 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 device order setting procedure 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.860
 besides rub 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 contrary to any 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 basically 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 football 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 as a result 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 double sided tape 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 memory card 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 new product development 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.759
 against perspective 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.759
 it will pass 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.290
 in order to program 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.029
 lighthouse but we have before 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.119
 with their team 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.379
 we prescribe the main opponent 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 Komsomolskaya 1 2 3 4 comma 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.679
 phone number 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.559
 set mode 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.299
 and the third set 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.919
 airing frequency 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.599
 proceed 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 true first 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.709
 then for five minutes on your 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.029
 The phone comes here such an installation 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.929
 it is registered in it 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.689
 our phone number 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.269
 note that 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.930
 three basic settings, their frequency 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.059
 broadcast 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.459
 30 minutes 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.789
 confusing our firms Samara fashion 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.789
 0 30 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.920
 next step 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.949
 send the following amounts to the team 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.729
 worked as a guardian of the transfer of coordinates 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.599
 hyperlink format 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.769
 besides 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.779
 1 2 3 4 because that password is capped 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.019
 other us big or small 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.019
 letters 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.879
 according to the team but because Lyakhom 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.079
 come but just like us as a hyperlink 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.069
 on carpka 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.069
 now we will try to open it 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.659
 football standards of the year 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:53.849
 for example man 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.549
 a service 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.549
 can bring 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.609
 we note that he 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.219
 I have a lighthouse 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.649
 on the windowsill 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:07.749
 things like that would prevent 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.749
 the influx of speculative 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.369
 you need another question 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.849
 invisible 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 UAH people around the world 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.139
 after he 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.069
 our lighthouse we have 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.180
 our cars 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.630
 well there was not any other channel 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.509
 inspector 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.740
 and test it for stability 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 frequency but worth 30 minutes 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.960
 broadcast 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.960
 but if everything is ok 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.339
 show exactly the coordinates i 

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.210
 I recommend to translate the lighthouse 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.090
 maximum mode is a single room 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.580
 once a day the account opened like this 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.509
 make 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.759
 set in the most secretive 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.759
 not place standards 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.430
 after we put on our 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.949
 cars 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.789
 ship the last install maybe 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.789
 thin frequency of broadcasting 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.960
 this is the optimal mode 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.539
 1 2 3 4 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.539
 peak cold that easy 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.529
 corn 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.339
 all of our beacons are in the mood 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.739
 Thank you all for your attention. Good luck. 

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.869
