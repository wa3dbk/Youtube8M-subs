00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.770
 hello you can ask yourself 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.020
 why am I in front of a set of 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.310
 purse because I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.770
 investment in bets 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.710
 sports and usually we associate 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.210
 investments and grows but I'm going 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.100
 show you that we can associate 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.100
 sports betting investments 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.820
 also why invest in 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.950
 sport bets 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.489
 and yes I speak well of investment 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 because for me it's a good alternative 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.400
 to what can exist today 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.019
 where can we invest today if I 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.160
 ask the question to 100 people 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:57.070
 they will tell me the purse has the O p 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.750
 and life insurance real estate as 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.699
 for example parties or 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.739
 apartments 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.590
 the man booklet like any good father of 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.830
 family but it will go down to 1% without 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.640
 delay yes it's safe but my 1% 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.370
 it will not change your life but 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.740
 never the sports bet of secularism 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 what is the reason necessarily a 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.450
 lack of knowledge of this new type 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.910
 investment is perhaps a 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.160
 philosophical question of how to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.380
 think we are Latin and not 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.330
 Anglo Saxons 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.590
 we are not used to betting 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 sports for most people 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.180
 the sports bet is bad it's dirty 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.650
 it's lucky 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 this only serves to launder money from 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.400
 Drugs 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.870
 so of course I force the line but I 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.750
 can you make sure that a lot of 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.410
 people I think in any case through 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350
 my blog 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.250
 I hope to change your mind 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.430
 any case I am speaking to the most 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.070
 skeptical of you many ways 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.800
 exists to do sports betting but 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.510
 what are they your own analyzes 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.930
 but you need some expertise 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.200
 and the time of the live betting of the trading 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.690
 but here too 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.180
 will take time a good knowledge 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 betting exchange 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.170
 that's the closest thing here to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.459
 the stock market 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.180
 thirdly, type of follow-up 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.220
 alas is accessible to all and only takes 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.480
 not much time 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.260
 you buy from a competent person 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.050
 advice I say sparkling them 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.299
 predictions to play because it is supposed to 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.500
 having analyzed the matches and therefore 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.840
 selected for you the best 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.310
 sports betting in shifter tracking 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.640
 some name bettors follow only 1 or 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.390
 2 and others that make the stream plays 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.250
 sometimes up to seize the day 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.890
 purpose for them and to rotate their 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.329
 capital their bankroll 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.819
 even if the king back on 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.680
 investment will be lower 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.470
 they will ultimately win over the mass 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.340
 to play money but it's an activity to 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.230
 full time be careful though because he 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.269
 typical hours who call themselves competent 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.389
 but in the long run it is very far 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.420
 to be true many of these types Steurs 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.280

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.910
 selling anything but a lot 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.680
 Disenchantment 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680
 because in the long run and not the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.670
 expected results and flowed 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.470
