right now I don't know if they're going

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.020 
right now I don't know if they're going
to<00:00:48.500> extend<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.309> United<00:00:49.580> States<00:00:49.760> I'm

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
to extend that to the United States I'm

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.280 
to extend that to the United States I'm
assuming<00:00:50.360> they're<00:00:50.480> going<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.780> sing<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.170> this

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
assuming they're going to sing is this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.170 
assuming they're going to sing is this
is<00:00:51.410> built<00:00:51.680> on<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.980> US<00:00:52.190> model<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:52.700> maybe<00:00:52.940> in<00:00:53.090> the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
is built on the US model so maybe in the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.750 
is built on the US model so maybe in the
future<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:53.570> not<00:00:53.629> right<00:00:53.900> now

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
future but not right now

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.509 
future but not right now
so<00:00:56.179> yeah<00:00:56.480> that's<00:00:56.690> pretty<00:00:56.809> much<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.519> outside

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
so yeah that's pretty much the outside

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.759 
so yeah that's pretty much the outside
how<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:59.120> got<00:00:59.239> your<00:00:59.300> front<00:01:00.230> facing<00:01:00.500> camera

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
right here and then you have your

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.130 
right here and then you have your
back<00:01:03.700> facing<00:01:04.000> camera<00:01:04.210> right<00:01:04.300> there

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
back facing camera right there

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.190 
back facing camera right there
two<00:01:05.680> speakers<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:07.150> we've<00:01:07.600> got<00:01:07.750> your<00:01:07.900> two
