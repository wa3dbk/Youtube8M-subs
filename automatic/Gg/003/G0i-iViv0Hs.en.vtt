00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's like the main place where you can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.510

anything after that he just was like all

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.200 
anything after that he just was like all
right<00:05:44.659> next<00:05:45.380> one<00:05:45.620> when<00:05:45.979> he<00:05:46.159> did<00:05:46.370> do<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:46.699> on<00:05:47.060> the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
right next one when he did do it on the

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.060 
right next one when he did do it on the
bottom<00:05:47.419> it<00:05:47.750> did<00:05:48.080> hurt<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.500> little<00:05:48.650> bit<00:05:48.860> more

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
bottom it did hurt a little bit more

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.800 
bottom it did hurt a little bit more
than<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.400> top<00:05:49.669> did<00:05:49.940> because<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.449> fact<00:05:50.659> that

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
than the top did because the fact that

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.320 
than the top did because the fact that
since<00:05:51.380> my<00:05:51.530> ear<00:05:51.710> is<00:05:51.830> not<00:05:52.009> fully<00:05:52.280> shaped<00:05:52.729> going<00:05:53.300> a

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
since my ear is not fully shaped going a

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.899 
since my ear is not fully shaped going a
little<00:05:53.750> bit<00:05:53.960> more<00:05:54.199> round<00:05:54.560> down<00:05:54.889> at<00:05:55.130> this<00:05:55.460> area

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
little bit more round down at this area

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.390 
little bit more round down at this area
he<00:05:56.599> did<00:05:56.840> have<00:05:57.050> to<00:05:57.229> push<00:05:57.440> it<00:05:57.470> more<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.130> back

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
he did have to push it more to the back

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.730 
he did have to push it more to the back
of<00:05:58.759> my<00:05:59.389> ear<00:05:59.419> and<00:06:00.020> what<00:06:00.169> I<00:06:00.199> mean<00:06:00.259> by<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.560> is

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
of my ear and what I mean by that is

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.149 
of my ear and what I mean by that is
like<00:06:01.039> look<00:06:01.280> at<00:06:01.370> this<00:06:01.580> he<00:06:02.150> literally<00:06:02.449> had<00:06:02.840> to

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
like look at this he literally had to

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.159 
like look at this he literally had to
pierce<00:06:04.159> the<00:06:04.490> back<00:06:04.940> part<00:06:05.479> right<00:06:05.659> here<00:06:05.690> because

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
pierce the back part right here because

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.740 
pierce the back part right here because
this<00:06:06.530> isn't<00:06:06.949> even<00:06:07.070> like<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.580> outer<00:06:08.000> portion

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
this isn't even like the outer portion

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.510 
this isn't even like the outer portion
of<00:06:09.080> my<00:06:09.199> ear<00:06:09.409> this<00:06:09.680> is<00:06:09.830> more<00:06:10.039> like<00:06:10.070> the<00:06:10.340> inner

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
of my ear this is more like the inner

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.899 
of my ear this is more like the inner
portion<00:06:10.880> so<00:06:11.659> it<00:06:12.440> did<00:06:12.710> somewhat<00:06:13.310> hurt<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.880> a

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
portion so it did somewhat hurt to a

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.180 
portion so it did somewhat hurt to a
certain<00:06:14.180> extent<00:06:14.539> but<00:06:14.840> I<00:06:15.020> did<00:06:15.409> handle<00:06:15.770> it<00:06:15.949> like

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
certain extent but I did handle it like

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.390 
certain extent but I did handle it like
a<00:06:16.250> champ<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:17.349> from<00:06:18.349> a<00:06:18.440> one<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.740> ten<00:06:19.009> one<00:06:19.370> being

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
a champ and from a one to ten one being

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.390 
a champ and from a one to ten one being
it<00:06:19.909> was<00:06:20.180> an<00:06:20.449> and<00:06:20.900> ten<00:06:21.440> being<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:22.009> worst<00:06:22.099> pain

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
it was an and ten being the worst pain

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.010

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
even a one it really didn't hurt me that

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.590
