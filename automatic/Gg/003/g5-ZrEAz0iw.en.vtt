it's<00:00:52.710> compatible<00:00:53.219> between<00:00:53.309> PlayStation<00:00:54.000> 3

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's compatible between PlayStation 3

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's compatible between PlayStation 3
and<00:00:54.360> PlayStation<00:00:54.420> Vita<00:00:54.870> owners<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.469> they

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and PlayStation Vita owners that they

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
and PlayStation Vita owners that they
can<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> interact<00:00:56.129> since<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
can kind of interact since it is the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
can kind of interact since it is the
same<00:00:57.870> part<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:59.370> about<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
same part I don't know about that I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.130 
same part I don't know about that I
think<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> different

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
think it's going to be a different

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.139 
think it's going to be a different
