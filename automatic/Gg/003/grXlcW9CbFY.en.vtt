00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.740 

goo-goo-goo<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.940> will<00:01:28.120> turn<00:01:28.600> into

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
goo-goo-goo and it will turn into

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
goo-goo-goo and it will turn into
Windows<00:01:29.610> 2000<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.450> awesome

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.630 

that<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:46.630> will<00:01:46.780> look<00:01:47.110> like<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.350> Windows<00:01:47.979> 2000

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
that it will look like a Windows 2000

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.440 
that it will look like a Windows 2000
but<00:01:48.850> it's<00:01:48.970> still<00:01:49.150> actually<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.690> Windows<00:01:50.170> 7<00:01:51.450> what

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
but it's still actually a Windows 7 what

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.170 
but it's still actually a Windows 7 what
this<00:01:52.720> does<00:01:52.960> basically<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:54.100> takes<00:01:54.820> all<00:01:55.060> the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
this does basically is takes all the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.980 
this does basically is takes all the
visual<00:01:55.960> features<00:01:56.590> away<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.060> about<00:01:58.360> more<00:01:58.659> round

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
visual features away so about more round

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.760 
visual features away so about more round
can<00:01:59.200> be<00:01:59.320> putting<00:01:59.590> together<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.409> another

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
can be putting together right so another

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.130 
can be putting together right so another
thing<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.070> can<00:02:03.310> do<00:02:03.580> which<00:02:04.060> will<00:02:04.330> double<00:02:04.960> your

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
thing you can do which will double your

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.620 
thing you can do which will double your
processor<00:02:05.860> speed<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.179> think<00:02:10.450> there's

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
processor speed is this I think there's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.420 
processor speed is this I think there's
only<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:10.899> slap<00:02:11.290> top<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:12.040> know<00:02:12.130> if<00:02:12.280> it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
only one slap top so I don't know if it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.500 
only one slap top so I don't know if it
works<00:02:12.670> for<00:02:13.500> computers<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.950> might<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.510> finger

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
works for computers it might do finger

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.630 
works for computers it might do finger
doors<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.620> might<00:02:17.860> click<00:02:18.070> on<00:02:18.280> your<00:02:18.400> battery

high-performance what this does

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.979 
high-performance what this does
basically<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.760> uses<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.500> lot<00:02:44.500> more<00:02:44.709> power<00:02:44.890> ball

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
basically is uses a lot more power ball

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.620 
basically is uses a lot more power ball
it<00:02:46.989> increases<00:02:47.980> your<00:02:48.239> processing<00:02:49.239> speed<00:02:49.269> and
