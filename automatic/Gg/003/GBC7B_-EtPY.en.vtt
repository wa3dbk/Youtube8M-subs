00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.370
 whether we are 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.380
 So the vehicle has the engine in front 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.240
 drive end or a front- wheel drive 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.870
 engine front drive front wide at 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.080
 Both must be driven by the differential 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.960
 the drive wheels are passed on 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.000
 in the front-wheel drive engine that sets 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.100
 gear balancing gear yes im 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.620
 manual transmission in and from here 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.330
 go the drive shafts to the left 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.330
 and right drive front wheel 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.110
 the wheels we have a life of their own 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.870
 move up and down so that 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.239
 These drive shafts with joints 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.510
 must be provided to this movement 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.339
 to be able to join 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.380
 exception is a star axis at the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.510
 but the rear axle is not exactly like that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 You will find quite modern in numerous 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.350
 American authors and in German 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 cars being some off-road 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.740
 The actual car of today was the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.930
 things have been around for a long time 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.940
 independent suspension there we come many 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.110
 many clips later again 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.410
 to talk about it in detail so the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.450
 bikes 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.220
 the drive wheels have their own life 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.950
 they make movements that have to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.990
 be balanced by joints there 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.810
 it's the same running young kinetic joints 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.850
 Whatever joints these joints 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.130
 are protected from moisture before 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.680
 rain in front of water through a rubber man 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.660
 had and there you should watch that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.120
 which has no cracks because otherwise it is 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.470
 joint what else is maintenance free too 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.470
 destroyed very quickly 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.360
 I only need those 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.640
 drive shaft my torque in the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.460
 wheels and then it's off 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.590
 then I'm on the street but there 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.480
 there is one more thing to keep in mind 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.090
 I remember ours 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.920
 The torque form is equal to eleven times that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.680
 torque the size is composed 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 from the force and the radius r 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.570
 if i have this shape now once 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.090
 Switch namely to f I want the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.330
 I get the size of the power out of it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.880
 on the street then comes out 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.150
 that the torque through the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.860
 I have to share the radius I'm setting now 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.640
 just give us the values â€‹â€‹we are looking for 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.959
 previously derived for that too 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.950
 torque what in the current 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.280
 is initiated 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.650
 I choose the 10,000 newton meters and as 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 radius on our drive wheel one meter 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.000
 just to make it easier to calculate 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.580
 then a force comes out of the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.269
 Wheels is available from 1000 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.269
 newton if i am in my simple one 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.390
 demonstration example now the radius 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.790
 of the wheel doubles to two meters 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.970
 that would be a four-meter bike , after all 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.070
 is only a thought model then see 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.050
 if i figure that out i will 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.690
 my drive on the street already 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:28.660
 halved to 5,000 minutes 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.090
 what does that say it says nothing else than 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.060
 that is a big moment in 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.370
 my wheels can initiate 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.489
 but the driving force on the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.250
 road depends depends on the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.560
 length of the radius so the rat 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.680
 midpoint until the riot point of 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.670
 road the bigger this radius is and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.560
 so small is the driving force at 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.100
 comparable introduced torque 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.680
 a small wheel brings more 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.910
 driving on the street as a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.910
 very big
