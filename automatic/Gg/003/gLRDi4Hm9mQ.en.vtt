00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
really cool sweep picking arpeggio but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
really cool sweep picking arpeggio but
it's<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> start<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.890> clean<00:00:41.280> sound

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
it's good to start with a clean sound

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.240 
it's good to start with a clean sound
and<00:00:41.879> I'd<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> say<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.070> could

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and I'd like to say that because I could

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.590 
and I'd like to say that because I could
run<00:00:44.550> before<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> could<00:00:45.360> walk

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
run before I could walk

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
run before I could walk
I'm<00:00:45.870> left-handed<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> said<00:00:47.430> showing<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.210> right

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
I'm left-handed I said showing my right

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
hand I'm left-handed I write with my

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
hand I'm left-handed I write with my
left<00:00:50.340> hand<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.420> everything<00:00:51.780> backwards<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
left hand I do everything backwards and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.529 
left hand I do everything backwards and
and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.699> okay<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.530> say<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
and I think it's okay but so I say to to

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.670 
and I think it's okay but so I say to to
students<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> free<00:00:57.840> keytar<00:00:58.109> campers<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
students and free keytar campers and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.529 
students and free keytar campers and
everything<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> any<00:01:00.210> speed<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
everything that do it in any speed you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
everything that do it in any speed you
like<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> comes<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like just go for it but when it comes to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
like just go for it but when it comes to
arpeggios<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.270> need<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.110> from

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
arpeggios you need to get it right from

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.460 
arpeggios you need to get it right from
the<00:01:04.680> start<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.580> practice<00:01:05.790> slowly<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:07.200> kind

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the start to practice slowly it's kind

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.730 
the start to practice slowly it's kind
of<00:01:07.530> stupid<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.159> start<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:12.439> warp<00:01:13.439> speed

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
of stupid to start at the warp speed

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.440 
of stupid to start at the warp speed
it's<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:16.890> tempting<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.759> need<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> get

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it's very tempting but you need to get

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.859 
it's very tempting but you need to get
all<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:18.930> notes<00:01:19.890> first<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.509> start<00:01:21.750> in

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
all the right notes first so we start in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.690 
all the right notes first so we start in
B<00:01:22.020> minor

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.240 

playing<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> same<00:01:33.000> note<00:01:33.650> it's<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:35.040> part

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
playing the same note it's actually part

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.820 
playing the same note it's actually part
of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> trick<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.880> makes<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> cool<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
of the trick that makes it cool this is

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:52.420 
of the trick that makes it cool this is
a<00:01:37.860> six<00:01:38.190> tablet<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> try<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:46.010> sweep<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:48.780> any<00:01:49.020> way

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.100 

then<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.550> can<00:01:53.729> move<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.720> from<00:01:55.470> B<00:01:55.890> Dorian<00:01:57.110> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
then we can move it to from B Dorian to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.219 
then we can move it to from B Dorian to
see<00:01:59.210> Lydian<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> two<00:02:05.820> top<00:02:06.270> notes<00:02:06.540> two<00:02:06.869> bottom

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
see Lydian so two top notes two bottom

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:36.289 
see Lydian so two top notes two bottom
notes<00:02:33.799> you<00:02:34.799> can<00:02:34.830> build<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:35.340> own<00:02:35.400> or<00:02:35.519> peji<00:02:35.940> Oso

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
notes you can build your own or peji Oso

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.650 
notes you can build your own or peji Oso
but<00:02:36.510> basically<00:02:36.870> these<00:02:37.110> are<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.350> ones<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:42.540> get

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
but basically these are the ones to get

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.039 
but basically these are the ones to get
a<00:02:42.720> good<00:02:42.870> flow<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.239> good<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.600> practice

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
a good flow that is good to practice

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.360 
a good flow that is good to practice
with<00:02:52.290> not<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.860> much<00:02:53.040> distortion<00:02:54.709> because<00:02:55.709> it's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
with not so much distortion because it's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.610 
with not so much distortion because it's
getting<00:02:56.640> really<00:02:56.910> messy<00:02:57.180> if<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.320> use<00:02:58.530> too<00:02:58.739> much

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:14.950 

so<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:14.210> can<00:03:14.240> do<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.810> basic

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
so so you can do it but the basic

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:29.410 
so so you can do it but the basic
structure<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:24.850> okay<00:03:26.410> arpeggio
