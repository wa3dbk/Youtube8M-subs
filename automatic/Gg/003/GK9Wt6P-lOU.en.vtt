00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.070

 also the xbox suffer 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.449
 they have to wait a bit 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 means the 12 march we can then 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.930
 to gamble at the beginning and that too is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.450
 the time I start so one 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.260
 bit more about battlefield 3 endgame 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.270
 to report 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 at the thing with battlefield 3 endgame 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.090
 the understood the full throttle 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.739
 motorcycle and so is not basta side 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 that was just bad and that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 also includes the point with the whole 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.899
 easter eggs are there really 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.460
 really many and also one 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.370
 few we have never seen before 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 you should have it here right now 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 to see a small menu on the screen 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 where you can choose which one 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.229
 easter eggs you want to see 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.119
 that is, if there is anything 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.220
 then you just appeals to you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.210
 click on it and you go directly to the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.799
 Start from the easter egg one of the well 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.979
 most original easter eggs so far in 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.920
 battlefield 3 endgame here is this 21st 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.590
 42 vehicle and that is as far as I know 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 1 of the top tips and in the right say 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.170
 you have not tested this game yet 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 have I recommend one more time I 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.650
 personally have too little 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.470
 I have no idea 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.360
 what it looks like and this dlc 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.579
 has many people to cause a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.530
 a little bit about talking like this 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.150
 little to think about whether it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 There is not a new part of it 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.040
 is something like 21 and 43 for 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.810
 For example, if that should be the case 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.880
 will be quite a lot of people 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.200
 I'm really happy 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.850
 probably also because the game 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.229
 in itself looks really cool and if 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 one then with decent graphics 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.680
 and really good gameplay imagines 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.930
 I will definitely do that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.479
 look at because it is already so a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 a little bit the community 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.719
 or the people who play there 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 a little bit to these or too 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.729
 you do not know why 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.370
 again in this dlc we have the nooke 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.629
 or has the skeleton of such 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.330
 skeletons we have been there before 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.830
 intended 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 At least I think so and that was in 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.600
 poverty kill dlc on the map albers 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.670
 but we did not know yet 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.830
 this is here and that is 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.240
 a terrorist hurry did not stay 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.550
 the graf german means in principle 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.690
 that's just a flying dino and that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.520
 is somehow already such a 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.140
 bit funky or if you look at that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.430
 let's see the thing flies so little 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.070
 through the area you can with the yes 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.810
 helicopters are behind and dachshunds 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.280
 do not know exactly what that should but if 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.530
 you think that dice 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 maybe something in that 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.580
 direction for example in battlefield her 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.920
 then, for example, by installing 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.930
 a game mode in which one stops in the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.820
 base and you spontaneously with four people 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.490
 Crowe off about that and then you have to 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.230
 I defend myself from the dinosaurs 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.320
 not like that with you but think so 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.300
 a kind of tower defense with dinos in 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.190
 Battlefield who is not that way again 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.320
 bad if the now so a bit 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.120
 was too much and a bit too 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.090
 We looked dangerous for him 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.070
 Now teddy bears are not horny and 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.630
 sweet whining full crass the have 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.680
 deserves to be in battlefield 3 with 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.450
 penker teddy bears 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.160
 Who did not always want them? 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.600
 never but seriously 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.920
 dragon i think it's really cool that 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.140
 motivates the player a bit 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.150
 take care and that's something 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.620
 cool I mean every game has to 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.700
 of his own easter eggs we had 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 now, for example, such a dead 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.489
 space 2 or 3 easter egg in vevey 3 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.290
 or are already a 1943 easter 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.910
 to see egg in battlefield 3 and so on 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.290
 continue and so on that means I think 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.570
 that's a really cool thing 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.850
 and I really appreciate that 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.709
 that makes it a bit hard as well 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.650
 really beer and really cool 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.360
 and original easter eggs in these 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.800
 new dlcs and I am 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.620
 really curious what in battlefield 4 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.780
 waiting for us another easter egg 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.910
 what already on previous dlcs 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.650
 or maps was to see is 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.989
 the sandcastle and I think it was there 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.880
 even to wake Iceland also eg 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.769
 somewhere in the spell of the desert 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.300
 probably has yes or coast and so on 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.250
 that means that does not think so 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.350
 so completely new but always again 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.450
 pretty nice to see there at the 43 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.250
 endgame also a new snow map 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.080
 there are available there 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.630
 Of course two still down 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.190
 provided the eastereggs and a few 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.419
 of it are really a few times on it 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.000
 available for example here 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.440
 these funny snow soldiers in the 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.720
 principle are nothing more than 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.640
 Snowmen with a metal hat on 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.590
 the head and they do it so often 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.330
 whether seriously hide down paderborn 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.640
 even like such a bouzouki cent 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.870
 battlefield bad company in the bushes 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.820
 I have the friend already such a 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.250
 little mention that vilja quite cool 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.780
 are game mode against dinosaurs too 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.280
 have now come to me like idea 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.500
 when she gave me a coupe here and that 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.510
 why do not you have a game mode? 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.880
 against snowmen with metal hat 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.830
 or even better yetis 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.270
 yeti footprints are already here 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.890
 to see in the video 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.260
 and that's one of the others too 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.060
 easter eggs means who is looking for 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.190

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.590
