00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.559
 go to the second floor and instead 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.199
 of gaulle of which 4 to 5 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.629
 as i am d you arrive you have to 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.149

 here we can not close it closed 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.679
 since short so you'll go 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 in front of the sofa and you're going 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.500
 actually sit on the record like 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.789
 I'm doing it like that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.590
 on the record and not on the end I 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.720
 sit on sofa end fine well we will 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 say not like that but when you have 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.030
 shown right before so on the channel on 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.259
 the record so to sit pushed to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.460
 pass alps got this for those who 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.500
 did not know yet but if I think that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.670
 you know just about all then the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.170
 only thing you have to do in fact 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.470
 it's looking out while staying 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 enough 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.369
 he presses the key for you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.080
 look up like that that makes 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.910
 deal that will be touching for you 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.630
 simply the only thing to do will be 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.849

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.300
 frankly I'm sorry I have not 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.830
