nine<00:00:37.350> essential<00:00:37.710> amino<00:00:37.859> acids<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> obviously

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
nine essential amino acids and obviously

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.970 
nine essential amino acids and obviously
there's<00:00:39.629> something<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.199> recognize<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
there's something that we recognize and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.459 
there's something that we recognize and
I'll<00:00:41.160> mention<00:00:41.309> those<00:00:41.519> first<00:00:41.989> then<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.109> ally

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I'll mention those first then an ally

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.090 
I'll mention those first then an ally
methionine<00:00:44.250> leucine<00:00:45.059> valine<00:00:46.100> isoleucine

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
methionine leucine valine isoleucine

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
methionine leucine valine isoleucine
which<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.609> branch<00:00:47.969> changes<00:00:48.390> last<00:00:48.510> ones<00:00:48.750> there

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
which is branch changes last ones there

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
which is branch changes last ones there
histidine<00:00:50.570> threonine<00:00:51.710> tryptophan<00:00:52.710> which

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
histidine threonine tryptophan which

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.049 
histidine threonine tryptophan which
gone<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.429> tryptophan<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.230> lysine<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> those

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
gone on tryptophan and lysine so those

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
gone on tryptophan and lysine so those
are<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> nine<00:00:57.359> essential<00:00:57.629> ones<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:59.129> do

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
are the nine essential ones and we do

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.880 
are the nine essential ones and we do
need<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.809> for<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.839> variety<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.469> tasks<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
need those for a variety of tasks the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.139 
need those for a variety of tasks the
body<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.219> we'll<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.820> second

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
body which we'll get into in a second

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
body which we'll get into in a second
and<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:04.980> mention<00:01:05.280> something<00:01:05.549> else

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and so I want to mention something else

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.999 
and so I want to mention something else
too<00:01:05.939> about<00:01:06.210> biological<00:01:06.960> value<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
too about biological value because that

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.890 
too about biological value because that
kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> directly<00:01:09.360> correlates<00:01:09.810> with

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
kind of directly correlates with

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.539 
kind of directly correlates with
essential<00:01:10.290> amino<00:01:10.380> acids<00:01:10.860> biological<00:01:11.400> value

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
essential amino acids biological value

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.960 
essential amino acids biological value
basically<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> measure<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> amount

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
basically is the measure of the amount

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.870 
basically is the measure of the amount
of<00:01:15.150> protein<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.619> food<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.820> be

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of protein from a food that can be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
of protein from a food that can be
absorbed<00:01:18.570> readily<00:01:19.110> by<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> body<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:20.189> its

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
absorbed readily by the body into its

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.330 
absorbed readily by the body into its
own<00:01:20.579> proteins<00:01:21.240> meaning<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.560> amino<00:01:22.890> acid

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
own proteins meaning the amino acid

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.499 
own proteins meaning the amino acid
profile<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:24.649> particular<00:01:25.649> food<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
profile of that particular food is

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
profile of that particular food is
complete<00:01:27.509> enough<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> body<00:01:28.439> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
complete enough where the body can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
complete enough where the body can
quickly<00:01:29.280> use<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.060> utilize<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.750> into

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
quickly use that utilize that into

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.510 
quickly use that utilize that into
growth<00:01:32.219> of<00:01:32.430> tissue<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:33.090> repair<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.070> obviously

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
everybody knows that all enzymes in the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.340 
everybody knows that all enzymes in the
body<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.310> made<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> protein<00:02:06.350> communication

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
body are made of a protein communication

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320 
body are made of a protein communication
between<00:02:07.439> brains<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.039> nerve<00:02:08.130> cells<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
between brains and nerve cells and the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.809 
between brains and nerve cells and the
presence<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> amino<00:02:10.019> acids

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
presence of amino acids

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
presence of amino acids
helps<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.879> vitamins<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.390> minerals<00:02:12.599> work<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
helps the vitamins and minerals work to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.920 
helps the vitamins and minerals work to
the<00:02:13.349> full<00:02:13.500> potential<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.069> essentially

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
the full potential so essentially

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.959 
the full potential so essentially
it's<00:02:15.049> become<00:02:15.349> slightly<00:02:15.739> deprived<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
it's become slightly deprived the

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.869 
it's become slightly deprived the
vitamins<00:02:17.329> and<00:02:17.359> minerals<00:02:17.540> also<00:02:17.989> don't<00:02:18.170> work<00:02:18.319> so

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
vitamins and minerals also don't work so

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.770 
vitamins and minerals also don't work so
essentially<00:02:19.879> NASA<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.239> kind<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.450> had<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:20.689> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
essentially NASA it's kind of had like a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.300 
essentially NASA it's kind of had like a
big<00:02:20.930> synergistic<00:02:21.680> effect<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.159> body

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
big synergistic effect on the body

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.149 
big synergistic effect on the body
that's<00:02:22.879> why<00:02:23.060> having<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.420> diet<00:02:23.629> full<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.230> a

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
that's why having a diet full of a

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.009 
that's why having a diet full of a
variety<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.640> food<00:02:25.939> is<00:02:26.150> very<00:02:26.299> important<00:02:26.810> stead

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
variety of food is very important stead

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.630 
variety of food is very important stead
of<00:02:27.049> eating<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.379> same<00:02:27.590> thing<00:02:27.950> every<00:02:28.099> day<00:02:28.400> every

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
of eating the same thing every day every

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.390 
of eating the same thing every day every
meal<00:02:28.790> not<00:02:29.090> having<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.569> variety<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.950> most

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
meal not having a variety and most

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.129 
meal not having a variety and most
important<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.879> regulate<00:02:32.359> blood<00:02:32.540> sugar<00:02:32.659> most

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.139 
important to regulate blood sugar most

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.949 
important to regulate blood sugar most
people<00:02:33.409> will<00:02:34.250> assume<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.569> know<00:02:35.659> only

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
people will assume that you know only

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.240 
people will assume that you know only
thing<00:02:36.109> that<00:02:36.349> regulates<00:02:36.680> blood<00:02:36.739> sugar<00:02:37.069> is

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
thing that regulates blood sugar is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.250 
thing that regulates blood sugar is
insulin<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.909> keeping<00:02:38.299> your<00:02:38.389> carbs<00:02:38.750> low<00:02:38.930> but

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
insulin and keeping your carbs low but

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.289 
insulin and keeping your carbs low but
something<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> masses<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.579> also<00:02:40.819> assist

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
something the masses can also assist

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.479 
something the masses can also assist
with<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.620> think<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.159> some<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
with that and I think that's some of the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.369 
with that and I think that's some of the
things<00:02:43.579> that<00:02:43.819> people<00:02:44.060> see<00:02:44.480> when<00:02:44.750> they<00:02:45.349> see

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
things that people see when they see

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.409 
things that people see when they see
difference<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.280> how<00:02:46.639> they<00:02:46.760> feel<00:02:46.790> during<00:02:47.269> the

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:47.419 
difference in how they feel during the

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.759 
difference in how they feel during the
training<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:47.959> they<00:02:48.079> sit<00:02:48.349> branched-chain

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
training when they sit branched-chain

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.949 
training when they sit branched-chain
amino<00:02:48.980> acids<00:02:49.549> or<00:02:49.700> they<00:02:50.239> have<00:02:50.419> ascension<00:02:50.870> and

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
amino acids or they have ascension and

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.899 
amino acids or they have ascension and
acids<00:02:51.290> during<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> workout<00:02:51.859> they<00:02:52.639> have<00:02:52.730> more

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
acids during the workout they have more

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.119 
acids during the workout they have more
sustained<00:02:53.389> energy<00:02:53.870> level<00:02:54.109> because<00:02:54.859> some<00:02:55.069> of

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
sustained energy level because some of

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.890 
sustained energy level because some of
the<00:02:55.220> muscles<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:55.909> be<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.209> can<00:02:56.629> use<00:02:56.750> those

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the muscles can be you can use those

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.899 
the muscles can be you can use those
amino<00:02:57.079> acids<00:02:57.470> as<00:02:57.620> energy<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:58.549> delayed

amino acids as energy and delayed

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.360 
amino acids as energy and delayed
fatigue<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.590> that's<00:03:00.590> something<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.219> you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
fatigue and that's something that you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.800 
fatigue and that's something that you
know<00:03:01.459> without<00:03:01.909> really<00:03:02.299> raising<00:03:02.719> blood

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
know without really raising blood

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.750 
know without really raising blood
without<00:03:03.019> raising<00:03:03.379> blood<00:03:03.469> sugar<00:03:03.829> so<00:03:04.280> that's<00:03:04.639> an

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
without raising blood sugar so that's an

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.580 
without raising blood sugar so that's an
important<00:03:05.120> factor<00:03:05.419> as<00:03:05.540> well<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:05.989> another

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
important factor as well and another

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.959 
important factor as well and another
thing<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.159> some<00:03:07.969> sources<00:03:08.299> as<00:03:08.659> we<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:08.989> know

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
thing is some sources as we all know

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.190 
thing is some sources as we all know
chicken<00:03:10.969> beef<00:03:11.329> eggs

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
chicken beef eggs

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.369 
chicken beef eggs
you<00:03:13.189> know<00:03:13.280> cottage<00:03:13.639> cheese<00:03:13.909> milk<00:03:14.359> all<00:03:14.810> those

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
you know cottage cheese milk all those

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.470 
you know cottage cheese milk all those
things<00:03:15.829> are<00:03:16.010> all<00:03:16.159> complete<00:03:16.819> sources<00:03:17.269> and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
things are all complete sources and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.960 
things are all complete sources and
those<00:03:18.109> all<00:03:18.349> have<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.650> most<00:03:18.889> amino<00:03:19.459> acid<00:03:19.879> it's

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
those all have the most amino acid it's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.719 
those all have the most amino acid it's
been<00:03:20.120> also<00:03:20.269> high<00:03:20.690> biological<00:03:21.199> value<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.220> I

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
been also high biological value and I

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:23.949 
been also high biological value and I
must<00:03:22.970> mentioned<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.359> like<00:03:23.479> things<00:03:23.780> like

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
must mentioned that like things like

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.129 
must mentioned that like things like
chicken<00:03:24.280> things<00:03:25.280> like<00:03:25.430> fish<00:03:25.729> whey<00:03:26.629> protein

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
chicken things like fish whey protein

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.830 
chicken things like fish whey protein
have<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.250> highest<00:03:28.519> biological<00:03:29.359> value<00:03:29.510> and

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
have the highest biological value and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.379 
have the highest biological value and
the<00:03:30.409> next<00:03:30.650> would<00:03:30.799> be<00:03:30.919> like<00:03:31.099> chicken<00:03:31.669> beef<00:03:32.060> and

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
the next would be like chicken beef and

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.649 
the next would be like chicken beef and
then<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.260> goes<00:03:33.409> down<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.799> line<00:03:34.510> I'm<00:03:35.510> gonna

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
then it goes down the line I'm gonna

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.439 
then it goes down the line I'm gonna
introduce<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:37.040> dog<00:03:37.579> just<00:03:38.000> because<00:03:38.299> it's
