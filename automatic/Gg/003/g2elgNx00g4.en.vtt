with<00:01:53.470> these<00:01:53.590> big<00:01:53.890> bubbles<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.580> then<00:01:55.060> goes

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
with these big bubbles and then goes

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.210 
with these big bubbles and then goes
into<00:01:55.420> worms<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.230> then<00:01:56.530> oh<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.920> then<00:01:57.040> it'll

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
into worms and then oh and then it'll

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.510 
into worms and then oh and then it'll
turn<00:01:57.310> into<00:01:57.370> spiders<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.660> you<00:01:58.750> know<00:01:59.370> so<00:02:00.370> this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
turn into spiders and you know so this

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.400 
turn into spiders and you know so this
is<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.730> beginning<00:02:00.880> stage<00:02:01.330> right<00:02:01.570> now<00:02:01.720> this<00:02:02.140> is

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
is the beginning stage right now this is

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.230 
is the beginning stage right now this is
I<00:02:02.440> well<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.220> actually<00:02:03.550> one<00:02:03.700> step<00:02:04.030> past

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
I well this is actually one step past

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.000 
I well this is actually one step past
the<00:02:04.420> beginning<00:02:04.720> stage<00:02:05.580> our<00:02:06.580> grain<00:02:07.210> bill

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
several hundred pounds of grain go into

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.640 
several hundred pounds of grain go into
a<00:02:11.650> into<00:02:12.190> our<00:02:12.370> kettle<00:02:12.700> with<00:02:13.350> several<00:02:14.350> hundred

a into our kettle with several hundred

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.970 
a into our kettle with several hundred
gallons<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.310> warm<00:02:15.550> water<00:02:15.850> hot<00:02:16.390> water<00:02:16.980> we

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
gallons of warm water hot water we

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.010 
gallons of warm water hot water we
convert<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:18.370> very<00:02:18.520> low<00:02:18.670> temperatures<00:02:19.150> very

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
convert at very low temperatures very

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.630 
convert at very low temperatures very
much<00:02:20.200> different<00:02:20.530> than<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> brewer<00:02:21.370> would

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
much different than that a brewer would

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.030 
much different than that a brewer would
not<00:02:22.120> not<00:02:22.420> very<00:02:22.630> much<00:02:22.840> different<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.350> we're

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
not not very much different but we're

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.680 
not not very much different but we're
not<00:02:24.160> looking<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.460> any<00:02:24.670> residual<00:02:25.030> sugars<00:02:25.420> so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
not looking for any residual sugars so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.210 
not looking for any residual sugars so
we're<00:02:26.230> looking<00:02:26.410> for<00:02:26.530> poor<00:02:26.680> conversion<00:02:27.130> what

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
we're looking for poor conversion what

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.160 
we're looking for poor conversion what
happens<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:28.180> about<00:02:28.360> perfectly<00:02:28.870> at<00:02:29.020> about

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
happens just about perfectly at about

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.970 
happens just about perfectly at about
147<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.100> 150<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:32.380> all<00:02:32.500> goes<00:02:32.650> into<00:02:32.830> our

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
147 to 150 so it all goes into our

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.950 
147 to 150 so it all goes into our
kettle<00:02:34.680> gets<00:02:35.680> agitated<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.210> left<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.810> about

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
warmer climate so we're saving a lot of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.800 
warmer climate so we're saving a lot of

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
atmospheric pressure being so so much

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.259 
atmospheric pressure being so so much
lower<00:03:56.330> than<00:03:56.630> say<00:03:56.900> at<00:03:56.989> sea<00:03:57.170> level<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:58.239> solution

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
lower than say at sea level the solution

lower than say at sea level the solution
the<00:03:59.930> beer<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:00.830> start<00:04:01.100> with<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.340> distillers

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
the beer we start with the distillers

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.449 
the beer we start with the distillers
beer<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:03.110> alcohol<00:04:03.530> vaporizes<00:04:03.890> off<00:04:04.340> the

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
beer the alcohol vaporizes off the

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.000 
beer the alcohol vaporizes off the
solution<00:04:04.850> at<00:04:05.150> lower<00:04:05.600> temperatures<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:06.200> less

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
solution at lower temperatures so less

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.430 
solution at lower temperatures so less
heat<00:04:07.220> input<00:04:07.430> less<00:04:08.390> water<00:04:08.690> usage<00:04:09.110> Rican

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
heat input less water usage Rican

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.309 
heat input less water usage Rican
dancing<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.250> whole<00:04:10.430> process<00:04:10.819> is<00:04:11.209> just

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
dancing it the whole process is just

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.540 
dancing it the whole process is just
very<00:04:12.319> efficient<00:04:12.860> up<00:04:12.950> here<00:04:13.130> at<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:13.310> altitude

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
very efficient up here at this altitude

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.090 
very efficient up here at this altitude
so<00:04:14.450> I'd<00:04:15.140> like<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.440> say<00:04:15.560> we<00:04:15.680> planned<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.070> that

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
so I'd like to say we planned it that

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.469 
so I'd like to say we planned it that
way<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.350> was<00:04:18.470> just<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.769> happy<00:04:19.010> coincidence

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
way but it was just a happy coincidence

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.690 
way but it was just a happy coincidence
after<00:04:20.479> it's<00:04:20.810> condensed<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.739> our<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.550> our

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
after it's condensed in our in our

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.850 
after it's condensed in our in our
condenser<00:04:23.270> here<00:04:23.450> travels<00:04:24.229> down<00:04:24.410> through<00:04:24.440> here

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
condenser here travels down through here

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.440

we<00:04:25.460> measure<00:04:25.669> its<00:04:25.910> gravity<00:04:26.680> using<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.919> simple

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
we measure its gravity using a simple

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.390 
we measure its gravity using a simple
hydrometer<00:04:29.450> a<00:04:29.800> principle<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.950> Archimedes

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
hydrometer a principle that Archimedes

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.090 
hydrometer a principle that Archimedes
figured<00:04:31.910> out<00:04:32.030> like<00:04:32.530> three<00:04:33.530> thousand<00:04:33.950> years

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
figured out like three thousand years

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.409 
figured out like three thousand years
ago<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:36.020> all<00:04:36.169> ends<00:04:36.440> up<00:04:36.560> in<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:38.210> this

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
ago and it all ends up in here so this

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.980 
ago and it all ends up in here so this

and chocolatey and got some interesting
mocha<00:04:58.310> no<00:04:58.340> those<00:04:58.780> yeah<00:04:59.780> I<00:05:00.080> use<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.410> lot<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.740> dark

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
mocha no those yeah I use a lot of dark

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.250 
mocha no those yeah I use a lot of dark
chocolate<00:05:00.979> malt<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.750> use<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> lot

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
chocolate malt so it's I use a lot

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.310 
chocolate malt so it's I use a lot
higher<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.979> higher<00:05:04.220> percentage<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:05.320> heavy

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
higher a higher percentage of heavy

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.080 
higher a higher percentage of heavy

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
malt whiskey which they yields less for

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.940 
malt whiskey which they yields less for
minimal<00:05:14.650> sugars<00:05:15.010> than<00:05:15.940> than<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:17.110> basic

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950

Brewers<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.520> rose<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.380> don't<00:05:21.160> have<00:05:21.280> as<00:05:21.400> much

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
Brewers to rose so I don't have as much

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.810 
Brewers to rose so I don't have as much
for<00:05:21.760> minimal<00:05:22.030> sugars<00:05:22.419> in<00:05:23.139> my<00:05:23.410> wash<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:24.370> costs

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
for minimal sugars in my wash it costs

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.879 
for minimal sugars in my wash it costs
me<00:05:24.940> more<00:05:25.120> they're<00:05:25.330> very<00:05:25.480> expensive<00:05:25.810> but<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.590> do

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
me more they're very expensive but I do

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.870 
me more they're very expensive but I do
it<00:05:27.190> for<00:05:27.370> those<00:05:27.550> flavors<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:29.860> know<00:05:29.889> a<00:05:30.250> lot<00:05:30.760> of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
it for those flavors you know a lot of

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.100 
it for those flavors you know a lot of
distillers<00:05:31.270> look<00:05:31.389> at<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.630> like<00:05:31.750> why<00:05:31.900> are<00:05:31.960> you

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
distillers look at it like why are you

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.780 
distillers look at it like why are you
why<00:05:32.320> are<00:05:32.350> you<00:05:32.470> using<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.889> stuff<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.340> can't

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
why are you using that stuff you can't

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.100 
why are you using that stuff you can't
get<00:05:33.850> enough<00:05:34.060> alcohol<00:05:34.240> out<00:05:34.720> of<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.080> know

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
get enough alcohol out of it you know

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.909 
get enough alcohol out of it you know
and<00:05:35.800> but<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.490> think<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:36.970> sacrifice<00:05:37.620> is<00:05:38.620> well

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
and but I think the sacrifice is well

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.770 
and but I think the sacrifice is well
worth<00:05:39.100> having<00:05:39.430> those<00:05:40.120> interesting<00:05:40.600> kale

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
worth having those interesting kale

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.820 
worth having those interesting kale
notes<00:05:41.610> not<00:05:42.610> tail<00:05:42.910> notes<00:05:43.210> but<00:05:43.510> finishing<00:05:44.470> notes

okay<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:45.310> from<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.729> eyes<00:05:46.020> from<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.110> receiver

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
okay so from the eyes from the receiver

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.340 
okay so from the eyes from the receiver
