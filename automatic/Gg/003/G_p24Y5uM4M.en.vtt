same two machines here this is the ELCA
stream<00:00:15.179> sorry<00:00:16.179> I'm<00:00:16.990> never<00:00:17.260> going<00:00:17.439> to<00:00:17.470> get<00:00:17.619> this

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
stream sorry I'm never going to get this

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.679 
stream sorry I'm never going to get this
right<00:00:17.949> this<00:00:18.250> is<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.519> alkaway<00:00:18.849> ultra<00:00:19.390> stream

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
right this is the alkaway ultra stream

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.769 
right this is the alkaway ultra stream
and<00:00:19.929> this<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.470> energy<00:00:20.740> SD<00:00:21.340> 501<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.210> today

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
and this is the energy SD 501 and today

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.620 
and this is the energy SD 501 and today
we're<00:00:22.990> going<00:00:23.109> to<00:00:23.199> take<00:00:23.470> compare<00:00:24.420> output<00:00:25.420> of

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
we're going to take compare output of

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.659 
we're going to take compare output of
oxidation<00:00:26.470> reduction<00:00:26.679> potential<00:00:27.400> which<00:00:27.640> is

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
oxidation reduction potential which is

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.210 
oxidation reduction potential which is
also<00:00:28.150> known<00:00:28.419> as<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.990> antioxidant<00:00:29.679> effect<00:00:30.009> and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
also known as the antioxidant effect and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.589 
also known as the antioxidant effect and
people<00:00:30.490> take<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.669> lot<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.970> notice<00:00:31.210> of<00:00:31.449> this

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
people take a lot of notice of this

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.049 
people take a lot of notice of this
because<00:00:32.410> they<00:00:32.529> figure<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:32.980> higher<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.640> is<00:00:33.760> the

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
because they figure the higher it is the

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.119 
because they figure the higher it is the
better<00:00:34.390> well<00:00:34.930> I'll<00:00:35.110> fill<00:00:35.649> you<00:00:35.739> in<00:00:35.770> on<00:00:35.950> that<00:00:35.980> a

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
better well I'll fill you in on that a

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.490 
better well I'll fill you in on that a
bit<00:00:36.309> later<00:00:36.460> it's<00:00:36.730> not<00:00:36.760> quite<00:00:37.149> true<00:00:37.329> but<00:00:37.750> that

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
bit later it's not quite true but that

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.830 
bit later it's not quite true but that
being<00:00:38.770> said<00:00:39.039> let's<00:00:39.489> compare<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.030> two<00:00:40.059> now

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
being said let's compare the two now

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.250 
being said let's compare the two now
I've<00:00:41.140> got<00:00:41.440> my<00:00:41.649> same<00:00:41.949> old<00:00:42.480> water<00:00:43.480> system<00:00:43.989> here

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
I've got my same old water system here

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.349 
I've got my same old water system here
I've<00:00:44.410> got<00:00:44.649> water<00:00:45.370> coming<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:45.910> I've<00:00:46.059> got<00:00:46.210> two

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
I've got water coming in I've got two

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.939 
I've got water coming in I've got two
outlets<00:00:46.719> to<00:00:46.899> make<00:00:46.930> sure<00:00:47.260> it's<00:00:47.410> exactly<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
outlets to make sure it's exactly the

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.279 
outlets to make sure it's exactly the
same<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.460> what<00:00:49.030> I'll<00:00:49.180> do<00:00:49.329> first<00:00:49.600> is<00:00:49.840> turn<00:00:50.079> on

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
same and what I'll do first is turn on

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.970 
same and what I'll do first is turn on
the<00:00:50.440> okra<00:00:50.949> stream<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.930> like<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.320> use<00:00:53.559> this<00:00:53.800> is

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
the okra stream we like to use this is

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:05.340 
the okra stream we like to use this is
about<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:54.930> liter<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.260> putting<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.800> two<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:05.110> use

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
about a liter and putting the two we use

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.370 
about a liter and putting the two we use
two<00:01:05.619> up<00:01:05.770> meters<00:01:06.189> simply<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.479> these<00:01:08.140> are

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
two up meters simply because these are

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.109 
two up meters simply because these are
very<00:01:08.409> unreliable<00:01:09.040> things<00:01:09.490> if<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.820> don't<00:01:10.030> know

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
very unreliable things if you don't know

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.490 
very unreliable things if you don't know
how<00:01:10.299> to<00:01:10.360> look<00:01:10.479> after<00:01:10.659> them<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.020> can<00:01:11.170> get<00:01:11.290> some

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
how to look after them you can get some

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.200 
how to look after them you can get some
really<00:01:11.740> crazy<00:01:12.159> ones<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:12.850> ever<00:01:12.970> see<00:01:13.180> a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
really crazy ones so if you ever see a

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.780 
really crazy ones so if you ever see a
video<00:01:13.509> with<00:01:14.409> one<00:01:14.799> ought<00:01:15.009> meter<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:15.610> know

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
video with one ought meter and you know

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.340 
video with one ought meter and you know
casually<00:01:16.329> brought<00:01:16.600> out<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.960> stuck<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.320> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
casually brought out and stuck in the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.740 
casually brought out and stuck in the
water<00:01:17.530> don't<00:01:18.100> believe<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.509> other<00:01:19.630> thing

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
water don't believe it the other thing

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.600 
water don't believe it the other thing
that<00:01:19.990> ought<00:01:20.259> meters<00:01:20.619> do<00:01:20.770> respond<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.490> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
that ought meters do respond to is the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.640 
that ought meters do respond to is the
amount<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.909> minerals<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.509> water<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:23.409> if

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
amount of minerals in the water so if

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.859 
amount of minerals in the water so if
you've<00:01:24.400> got<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> video<00:01:24.939> from<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:25.390> place<00:01:25.689> for

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
you've got a video from a place for

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.510 
you've got a video from a place for
instance<00:01:26.200> California<00:01:26.409> where<00:01:27.100> there's<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.369> lot

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
instance California where there's a lot

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.670 
instance California where there's a lot
of<00:01:27.840> calcium<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:28.899> their<00:01:29.020> water<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.350> get<00:01:29.470> very

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
of calcium in their water you get very

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.429 
of calcium in their water you get very
high<00:01:29.890> up<00:01:30.130> readings<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:31.119> that's<00:01:31.720> why<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:32.110> prefer

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
high up readings so that's why I prefer

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.859 
high up readings so that's why I prefer
to<00:01:32.740> compare<00:01:33.220> one<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.880> another<00:01:34.329> with<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.630> same

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
to compare one to another with the same

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.609 
to compare one to another with the same
source<00:01:35.200> water<00:01:35.439> now<00:01:36.159> we<00:01:37.149> had<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.200> water<00:01:38.409> we

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
source water now we had the the water we

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.120 
source water now we had the the water we
had<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.119> thought<00:01:40.119> meters<00:01:40.540> in<00:01:40.689> here<00:01:40.960> was<00:01:41.649> a

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
had the thought meters in here was a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.039 
had the thought meters in here was a
special<00:01:42.700> solution<00:01:43.119> for<00:01:43.329> cleaning<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.930> to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
special solution for cleaning them to

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.240 
special solution for cleaning them to
make<00:01:44.200> sure<00:01:44.350> they<00:01:44.530> work<00:01:44.710> properly<00:01:44.740> at<00:01:45.159> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
make sure they work properly at the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.249 
make sure they work properly at the
start<00:01:45.549> so<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.090> would<00:01:46.479> be<00:01:46.600> seeing<00:01:46.899> them<00:01:47.079> going

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
start so you would be seeing them going

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.709 
start so you would be seeing them going
down<00:01:47.590> now<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.909> notice<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.329> one's<00:01:49.509> going

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
down now you notice that one's going

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.389 
down now you notice that one's going
down<00:01:49.810> slower<00:01:50.229> than<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.469> other<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.070> I'm<00:01:51.219> like

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
down slower than the other but I'm like

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.429 
down slower than the other but I'm like
golly<00:01:51.549> we're<00:01:51.790> down<00:01:51.939> below<00:01:52.119> 400<00:01:52.869> already<00:01:53.020> and

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
golly we're down below 400 already and

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.800 
golly we're down below 400 already and
it's<00:01:53.619> still<00:01:53.860> going<00:01:54.040> fast<00:01:54.399> okay<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.780> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
it's still going fast okay there is a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.420 
it's still going fast okay there is a
few<00:01:59.140> little<00:01:59.380> tricks<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.829> you'll<00:02:00.070> see<00:02:00.250> you'll

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
few little tricks that you'll see you'll

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.279 
few little tricks that you'll see you'll
see<00:02:00.460> people<00:02:00.789> swizzle<00:02:01.360> sticks<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.899> don't<00:02:02.110> like

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
see people swizzle sticks I don't like

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.200 
see people swizzle sticks I don't like
to<00:02:02.409> do<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.740> because<00:02:03.039> I'm<00:02:03.549> told<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.939> that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
to do that because I'm told that that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.929 
to do that because I'm told that that
gives<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.539> false<00:02:04.750> reading<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.520> we're<00:02:06.670> not<00:02:06.759> going

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
gives a false reading so we're not going

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.370 
gives a false reading so we're not going

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
to swizzle sticks here we're just going

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.350 
to swizzle sticks here we're just going
to<00:02:08.470> let<00:02:08.620> it<00:02:08.740> go<00:02:08.920> even<00:02:09.490> though<00:02:09.790> it<00:02:09.910> does<00:02:10.090> take<00:02:10.330> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
to let it go even though it does take a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
to let it go even though it does take a
little<00:02:10.600> time

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
little time

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.530 
little time
for<00:02:12.910> me<00:02:13.350> looking<00:02:14.350> at<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:15.030> 440<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.390> usually

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
for me looking at that 440 I can usually

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.000 
for me looking at that 440 I can usually
tell<00:02:16.870> from<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.170> speed<00:02:17.410> that's<00:02:17.560> working<00:02:17.950> is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
tell from the speed that's working is

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.950 
tell from the speed that's working is
probably<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.580> go<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:18.910> minus<00:02:19.390> 500

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
probably going to go to about minus 500

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.830 
probably going to go to about minus 500
which<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.140> quite<00:02:20.560> fantastic<00:02:20.890> actually

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
which is quite fantastic actually

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.470 
which is quite fantastic actually
for<00:02:22.840> an<00:02:23.110> operating<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.610> mentioned<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.450> you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
for an operating and I mentioned to you

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.810 
for an operating and I mentioned to you
early<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.320> very<00:02:26.650> high<00:02:26.950> operating<00:02:27.340> really

early that very high operating really
don't<00:02:28.060> do<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.600> lot<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.410> because<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.610> will

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
don't do a lot for you because you will

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.410 
don't do a lot for you because you will
only<00:02:31.090> have<00:02:31.750> free<00:02:32.560> hydrogen<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.340> your<00:02:33.490> body<00:02:33.790> you

only have free hydrogen in your body you

radical oxygen I learned years ago that

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.300 
radical oxygen I learned years ago that
this<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:43.000> such<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.840> effective<00:02:44.410> as<00:02:44.620> an

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
this is such so effective as an

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.480 
this is such so effective as an
antioxidant<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.620> very<00:02:48.010> often<00:02:48.370> you'll

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
antioxidant that you very often you'll

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.860 
antioxidant that you very often you'll
be<00:02:48.640> drinking<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.120> water<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.540> you'll<00:02:49.720> be

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
be drinking this water and you'll be

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
peeing out antioxidants because there's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.650 
peeing out antioxidants because there's
nowhere<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:52.990> it<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.230> go<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:55.270> know<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
nowhere for it to go so you know the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900 
nowhere for it to go so you know the
very<00:02:56.050> very<00:02:56.170> high<00:02:56.410> readings<00:02:56.830> are<00:02:57.040> usually

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
very very high readings are usually

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.120 
very very high readings are usually
accompanied<00:02:58.330> with<00:02:58.380> rather<00:02:59.380> bad<00:02:59.710> tasting

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
accompanied with rather bad tasting

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.950 
accompanied with rather bad tasting
water<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.030> know<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.180> don't<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.870> go

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
water so you know I don't like to go

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.530 
water so you know I don't like to go
over<00:03:02.230> about<00:03:02.320> 500<00:03:03.010> even<00:03:03.160> though<00:03:03.370> we've<00:03:03.910> seen<00:03:03.940> it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
over about 500 even though we've seen it

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.410 
over about 500 even though we've seen it
possible<00:03:05.200> okay<00:03:06.040> what<00:03:06.160> do<00:03:06.220> we<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.490> look

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
possible okay what do we have to look

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.570 
possible okay what do we have to look
that's<00:03:07.690> going<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> for<00:03:08.260> 70<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.950> think<00:03:09.460> it's

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
that's going to for 70 I think it's

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.000 
that's going to for 70 I think it's
going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.880> go<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> 500<00:03:10.780> because<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:11.800> still

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
going to go to 500 because it's still

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.080 
going to go to 500 because it's still
going<00:03:12.220> strong

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
going strong

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.740 
going strong
the<00:03:13.720> lower<00:03:14.140> one<00:03:14.530> knows<00:03:15.430> only<00:03:15.730> 380<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.570> that's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
the lower one knows only 380 and that's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.270 
the lower one knows only 380 and that's
very<00:03:16.990> typical<00:03:17.200> I'll<00:03:17.860> turn<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:20.040> energy<00:03:21.040> now

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
very typical I'll turn on the energy now

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.770 
very typical I'll turn on the energy now
it<00:03:22.120> takes<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.540> while<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> turn<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:24.450> I've<00:03:25.450> got<00:03:25.690> to

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
it takes a while to turn on I've got to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.630 
it takes a while to turn on I've got to
turn<00:03:25.960> on<00:03:26.110> now<00:03:26.410> it'll<00:03:27.040> come<00:03:27.220> through<00:03:27.460> in<00:03:27.580> a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
turn on now it'll come through in a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.080 
turn on now it'll come through in a
minute

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
minute

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:39.240 
minute
and<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:29.260> we'll<00:03:29.410> compare<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.800> might

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
and then we'll compare and you might

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.710 
and then we'll compare and you might
hear<00:03:39.430> noise<00:03:39.670> there<00:03:39.970> I've<00:03:40.090> got<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.240> buck<00:03:40.480> at<00:03:40.630> the

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
hear noise there I've got a buck at the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.600 
hear noise there I've got a buck at the
end<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:44.410> let's<00:03:44.590> see<00:03:44.830> what<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.190> produced<00:03:45.580> oh

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
end and let's see what it's produced oh

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.760 
end and let's see what it's produced oh
my<00:03:48.610> god<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:48.970> going<00:03:49.180> down<00:03:49.450> it's<00:03:50.350> going<00:03:50.440> down

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
my god it's going down it's going down

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.980 
my god it's going down it's going down
fast

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
fast

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.520 
fast
we're<00:03:52.990> down<00:03:57.660> well<00:03:58.660> it's<00:03:59.080> going<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.290> take<00:03:59.500> a

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
we're down well it's going to take a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.080 
we're down well it's going to take a
little<00:03:59.710> while<00:03:59.980> for<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.370> happen<00:04:00.610> but

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
little while for it to happen but

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.740 
little while for it to happen but
suffice<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.170> say<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.880> energy<00:04:04.300> in<00:04:04.600> this

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
suffice to say that the energy in this

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.190 
suffice to say that the energy in this
case<00:04:04.990> is<00:04:05.320> not<00:04:05.740> producing<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.460> same<00:04:07.200> oxidation

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
case is not producing the same oxidation

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.680 
case is not producing the same oxidation
reduction<00:04:08.320> potential<00:04:08.980> as<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:10.060> ultra<00:04:10.420> stream

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
reduction potential as the ultra stream

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.750 
reduction potential as the ultra stream
now<00:04:11.170> let's<00:04:11.380> say<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.740> case<00:04:12.010> because<00:04:12.310> you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
now let's say in this case because you

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.330 
now let's say in this case because you
know<00:04:13.150> I'm<00:04:13.240> not<00:04:13.300> trying<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.870> say<00:04:14.740> that's<00:04:15.040> always

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
know I'm not trying to say that's always

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.490 
know I'm not trying to say that's always
the<00:04:16.000> case<00:04:16.180> I'm<00:04:16.420> not<00:04:16.570> trying<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.959> say<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.410> it

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
the case I'm not trying to say that it

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.630 
the case I'm not trying to say that it
can't<00:04:17.980> go<00:04:18.220> higher

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
can't go higher

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.670 
can't go higher
I<00:04:18.790> believe<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.209> energy<00:04:19.540> can<00:04:19.810> if<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.229> put<00:04:20.500> the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
I believe the energy can if you put the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
I believe the energy can if you put the
pH<00:04:20.979> right<00:04:21.280> up

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
pH right up

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.420 
pH right up
but<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.510> my<00:04:22.750> experience<00:04:22.900> anything<00:04:23.740> from<00:04:23.950> 8

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
but in my experience anything from 8

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.969 
but in my experience anything from 8
9.5<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.330> lovely<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.810> drink<00:04:26.080> anything<00:04:26.590> over

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
9.5 is lovely to drink anything over

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.590 
9.5 is lovely to drink anything over
that<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.280> wouldn't<00:04:27.520> want<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.699> drink<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.479> if

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
that you wouldn't want to drink so if

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.689 
that you wouldn't want to drink so if
you're<00:04:28.720> doing<00:04:28.870> very<00:04:29.229> high<00:04:29.440> pH<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.430> be<00:04:30.580> able

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
you're doing very high pH is to be able

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.110 
you're doing very high pH is to be able
to<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.300> very<00:04:31.720> high<00:04:31.780> up<00:04:32.110> well<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.759> can<00:04:33.970> have

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
to get a very high up well it can have

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.260 
to get a very high up well it can have
some<00:04:34.300> very<00:04:34.419> nasty<00:04:34.690> effects<00:04:36.060> particularly<00:04:37.060> in

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
some very nasty effects particularly in

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.469 
some very nasty effects particularly in
the<00:04:37.419> diarrhea<00:04:38.229> area<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.490> what<00:04:40.270> have<00:04:40.389> we<00:04:40.419> got

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
the diarrhea area so what have we got

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.760 
the diarrhea area so what have we got
we're<00:04:40.720> gonna<00:04:40.780> have<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> last<00:04:41.169> look<00:04:41.289> because<00:04:41.650> I

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
we're gonna have a last look because I

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.990 
we're gonna have a last look because I
think<00:04:41.830> we're<00:04:42.070> getting<00:04:42.280> about<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.610> same<00:04:42.789> time

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
think we're getting about the same time

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.590 
think we're getting about the same time
all<00:04:43.210> right

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
all right

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.409 
all right
you<00:04:44.560> saw<00:04:44.889> that<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.520> ultra<00:04:46.060> stream<00:04:46.300> was

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
you saw that the ultra stream was

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.450 
you saw that the ultra stream was
getting<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.780> close<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.199> 500<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.949> think<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.250> think

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
getting it close to 500 I think I think

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.020 
getting it close to 500 I think I think
that's<00:04:48.639> right<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:49.270> 500<00:04:49.870> we're<00:04:50.080> down<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:51.030> 365

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
that's right for 500 we're down to 365

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.710 
that's right for 500 we're down to 365
here<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:53.039> 316<00:04:54.039> in<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.550> one<00:04:57.240> not<00:04:58.240> much<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.570> say

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
here and 316 in this one not much to say

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.629 
here and 316 in this one not much to say
is<00:04:58.930> there<00:04:59.080> really<00:04:59.289> as<00:04:59.830> I<00:05:00.039> said<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.430> other

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
is there really as I said on the other

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.900 
is there really as I said on the other
videos<00:05:01.030> this<00:05:01.870> runs<00:05:02.110> 100<00:05:02.710> dollars<00:05:03.009> this<00:05:03.669> one's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
videos this runs 100 dollars this one's

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.629 
videos this runs 100 dollars this one's
four<00:05:04.150> thousand<00:05:04.690> dollars<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.830> it's<00:05:06.460> not<00:05:06.610> a

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
four thousand dollars and it's not a

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:15.850 
four thousand dollars and it's not a
tough<00:05:06.910> decision

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.919
