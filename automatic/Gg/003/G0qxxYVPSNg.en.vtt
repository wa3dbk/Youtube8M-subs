get<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> edge<00:01:55.590> foxhole<00:01:56.630> it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
get it so what is the edge foxhole it's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.709 
get it so what is the edge foxhole it's
it's<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> edge<00:01:58.350> easy<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.070> adds<00:02:00.060> pressure<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's the edge easy and adds pressure to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's the edge easy and adds pressure to
combine<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.770> custom<00:02:02.310> play<00:02:02.520> books<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.270> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
combine with custom play books and I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959 
combine with custom play books and I
can't<00:02:03.659> give<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> away<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.729> we're<00:02:05.729> going

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
can't give it away but out we're going

guys when you're talking about the edge
foxhole<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.510> my<00:02:12.720> favorite

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
foxhole is my favorite

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
foxhole is my favorite

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the edge easy was developed by using the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.330 
the edge easy was developed by using the
Cleveland<00:02:29.160> Browns<00:02:29.400> guys<00:02:29.940> no<00:02:30.660> joke<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:32.100> guy's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
Cleveland Browns guys no joke this guy's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.430 
Cleveland Browns guys no joke this guy's
up<00:02:32.610> over<00:02:32.880> 700<00:02:33.480> don't<00:02:33.660> throw<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.170> guys

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
up over 700 don't throw it there guys

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.200 
up over 700 don't throw it there guys
once<00:02:35.220> again<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:36.750> simple<00:02:37.500> physics<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:39.000> you

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
once again it's simple physics if you

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.970 
once again it's simple physics if you
can<00:02:39.420> figure<00:02:39.600> out<00:02:39.720> how<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.350> guys<00:02:40.590> playing

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
can figure out how to get guys playing

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640 
can figure out how to get guys playing
well<00:02:41.310> they<00:02:42.210> will<00:02:42.390> play<00:02:42.630> well<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:43.380> theory

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
well they will play well but your theory

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.560 
well they will play well but your theory
has<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.340> sound<00:02:44.700> we've<00:02:45.000> done<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.390> work<00:02:45.540> for

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
has to be sound we've done the work for

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.650 
has to be sound we've done the work for
you<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.080> matinees<00:02:46.590> calm<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.370> here<00:02:48.180> we're

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
you here matinees calm and here we're

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080 
you here matinees calm and here we're
going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:49.050> into<00:02:49.550> playing<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> guy<00:02:50.820> who's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
going to go into playing the guy who's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.870 
going to go into playing the guy who's
up<00:02:51.240> over<00:02:51.680> 800<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.830> that's<00:02:53.160> how<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.460> know<00:02:53.700> when

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
up over 800 and that's how you know when

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.820 
up over 800 and that's how you know when
the<00:02:53.970> scheme<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.360> really<00:02:54.660> good<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.380> he<00:02:55.500> drives

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the scheme is really good that he drives

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.710 
the scheme is really good that he drives
down<00:02:56.100> there<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:56.940> bit<00:02:57.150> tough<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.450> figure

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
down there a little bit tough to figure

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.930 
down there a little bit tough to figure
out<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.410> get<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> bad<00:02:58.950> break<00:02:59.430> my<00:02:59.670> horse

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
out and then we get a bad break my horse

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.350 
out and then we get a bad break my horse
Steven<00:03:00.570> Jackson<00:03:00.900> fumbles<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.950> fall<00:03:02.220> down

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
Steven Jackson fumbles so we fall down

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.740 
Steven Jackson fumbles so we fall down
14-0<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.480> chop

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
14-0 I like to say that if you can chop

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.590 
14-0 I like to say that if you can chop
a<00:03:06.780> guy<00:03:07.110> down<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:08.010> walk<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> guy<00:03:09.440> down

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
a guy down if you can walk a guy down

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.550 
a guy down if you can walk a guy down
with<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> scheme<00:03:13.020> on<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:14.490> road<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.560> your

team is not supposed to win that's how
you<00:03:18.780> know<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.050> scheme<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.850> real<00:03:21.180> deal<00:03:22.520> stuff

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
you know a scheme is the real deal stuff

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.090 
you know a scheme is the real deal stuff
and<00:03:23.760> gore<00:03:24.000> guys<00:03:24.380> extreme<00:03:25.380> pressure<00:03:25.770> that<00:03:26.010> I

that's the way we do it at matinees calm
but<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> cannot<00:03:50.880> stress<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:52.010> if<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.130> want<00:03:53.340> to

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
but I cannot stress that if you want to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.729 
but I cannot stress that if you want to
be<00:03:53.489> dominant<00:03:53.940> there's<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.450> pressure<00:03:54.750> getting

be dominant there's the pressure getting

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.170 
be dominant there's the pressure getting
that<00:03:55.920> wild<00:03:56.280> throw<00:03:56.550> if<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.820> want<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> be

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
that wild throw if you want to be
