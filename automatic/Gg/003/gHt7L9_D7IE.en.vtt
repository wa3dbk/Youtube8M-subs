and you know some some stadiums have

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.490 
and you know some some stadiums have
instead<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.630> typical<00:01:25.080> bleachers

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
instead of just typical bleachers

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
instead of just typical bleachers
they'll<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.479> giant<00:01:27.479> green<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.680> hills

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
they'll have a giant green like hills

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.990 
they'll have a giant green like hills
that<00:01:29.430> people<00:01:29.729> sit<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:29.970> at<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> games<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.970> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that people sit on at the games and so I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
that people sit on at the games and so I
went<00:01:33.210> behind<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.840> hills<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.409> saw

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
went behind one of these hills and I saw

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.550 
went behind one of these hills and I saw
a<00:01:34.650> bunch<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> kids<00:01:35.250> playing<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:37.229> they

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
a bunch of kids playing but I think they

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620 
a bunch of kids playing but I think they
were<00:01:37.619> playing<00:01:37.950> tackle<00:01:38.640> football<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.570> they

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
were playing tackle football and they

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.060 
were playing tackle football and they
were<00:01:39.689> older<00:01:40.049> than<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.619> didn't<00:01:41.009> really

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
were older than me so I didn't really

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.380 
were older than me so I didn't really
want<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.490> play<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.640> was

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
want to play with them and so I was

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
want to play with them and so I was
super<00:01:45.630> bored<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.500> had<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.890> water<00:01:47.369> bottle

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
super bored and I had this water bottle

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.780 
super bored and I had this water bottle
and<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.360> maybe<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:50.240> if<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.810> memory<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
and it was maybe like if my memory is

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.660 
and it was maybe like if my memory is
right<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.060> probably<00:01:55.250> three-quarters<00:01:56.250> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
right it's probably three-quarters of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
right it's probably three-quarters of
the<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.030> filled<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.600> water<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the way filled up with water and so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
the way filled up with water and so
pretty<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.240> all<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:03.680> either

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
pretty much all I would do was either

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
pretty much all I would do was either
throw<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.310> ball<00:02:05.820> throw<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.990> bottle<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
throw this ball throw this bottle of

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.360 
throw this ball throw this bottle of
water<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.759> hill<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.310> throw<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
water up or down the hill and throw it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.949 
water up or down the hill and throw it
to<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> very<00:02:11.730> bottom<00:02:12.030> or<00:02:12.330> very<00:02:12.510> top<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to the very bottom or very top of the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580
