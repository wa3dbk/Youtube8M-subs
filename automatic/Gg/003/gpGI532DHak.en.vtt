00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you open the bleeder valve a lot of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.600 
you open the bleeder valve a lot of
breaks<00:01:39.270> who<00:01:39.630> witness<00:01:40.110> spray<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.220> from<00:01:41.460> this

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
we can read it and see from there how it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.960 
we can read it and see from there how it
goes<00:02:39.739> if<00:02:40.750> L<00:02:41.750> becomes<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:43.160> know<00:02:43.190> farm<00:02:43.910> back<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
goes if L becomes you know farm back the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.840 
goes if L becomes you know farm back the
same<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.310> passenger<00:02:49.310> side<00:02:49.340> or
