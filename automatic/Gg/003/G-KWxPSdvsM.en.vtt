00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.940
 hello are you the spartan channel friends 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.940
 haha inside video 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello very good to all geeks of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.230
 youtube here is an expert in commenting 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 as is natural another new shine space 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.060
 this time he's going to make the negotiator 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.930
 weapon that is sister of the evangelizadora 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.970
 but that does not look like anything 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.580
 to start as almost always 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.950
 we will apply a standard heavy framework 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.290
 as you already know if we can be of 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.390
 elite while it is heavy everything is worth 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.970
 the next thing we have to add are 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.530
 two external cores both above and 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.690
 down is to say the two tools 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.720
 both lower and higher must be 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.410
 of core tesla now comes the good thing 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.800
 as primary or main adapter and what 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.079
 that we will add 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.780
 although a little special is a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.680
 precision adapter yes it is true that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.930
 I can choose the negotiator who is 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.970
 the original but I guess those who do not 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.750
 have this pack because they can not use 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.479
 this accessory but luckily the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.670
 precision labrador is really 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.670
 similar to this improvement 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.340
 as adapted the secondary we can use 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.120
 the default that is the classic the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.060
 original of the negotiator 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.480
 in reality that is the one that should 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.940
 show you but I like the modified to 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.280
 I like the compressor 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.280
 what are you going to see that launches 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.970
 good the case is that to create the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.680
 real negotiator the original only 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.610
 you will have to put in adapter 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.970
 secondary 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.580
 the default and so you spend less 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.290
 your breasts is scarce fuck 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.540
 Well, after creating the soul, we are going to 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.330
 try it 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.510
 the illusion does not have proof launches that 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.390
 nothing congratulates you to make play games 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.620
 previous dead space 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 remembering him 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.830
 Main shot as the typical 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 contact ray is to say you have to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.150
 press lr1 wait for it to be recharged 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.710
 and releasing so the longer you are 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:28.270
 squeezing more powerful will be your shot 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:32.400
 with the special ingredient of riot is 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 the idea of â€‹â€‹electric shock 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:43.640
 for the second classic shot of space 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.350
 the typical finished 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.990
 as default this is a case of 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.700
 scorers that is pretty much better but 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.780
 good to do what you want in your 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.940
 nation and as I say I have always been not 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.760
 forget to subscribe for more guides and 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.930
 I make space like these and like many more 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.200
 What do I have left? 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 greetings here spartan us day to 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.620
 day
