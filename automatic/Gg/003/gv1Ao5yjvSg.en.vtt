of<00:01:36.240> galaxy<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:38.009> loved<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.400> movie<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
of galaxy I really loved that movie so I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140 
of galaxy I really loved that movie so I
picked<00:01:39.479> them<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.720> too<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> didn't<00:01:41.939> really

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
picked them up too and I didn't really

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
picked them up too and I didn't really
want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> pick<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.540> all<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> villains<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
want to pick up all the villains but I

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
want to pick up all the villains but I
thought<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> should<00:01:44.040> pick<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.430> Thanos<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.060> least

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
thought I should pick up Thanos at least

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
thought I should pick up Thanos at least
because<00:01:45.630> he's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> good<00:01:46.320> tie<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.250> villain

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
because he's a good tie in villain

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
because he's a good tie in villain
between<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> Guardians<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> Avengers

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
between the Guardians and the Avengers

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
between the Guardians and the Avengers
and<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> picked<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.329> O's<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> he's<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and so I picked up that O's and he's a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.499 
and so I picked up that O's and he's a
huge<00:01:52.759> honking<00:01:53.759> fear<00:01:55.520> check<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> box

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
huge honking fear check out the box

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.080 
huge honking fear check out the box
that's<00:01:57.719> Thanos<00:01:58.320> box<00:01:58.740> compared<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.460> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that's Thanos box compared to the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 
that's Thanos box compared to the
standard<00:02:00.600> boxes<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> he's<00:02:02.909> number<00:02:03.180> 70

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
standard boxes there so he's number 70

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.850 
standard boxes there so he's number 70
