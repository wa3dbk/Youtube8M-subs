00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.889
 hello everyone welcome i'm esther and in 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.690
 this time as we are in summer what 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.240
 better idea than to make a car seat 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.519
 beach to use as a support for 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.160
 the mobile 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.990
 I like it so stay with me to see 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.990
 how it is done step by step 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 to make this craft we are going to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.260
 need 6 ice cream sticks and some 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.660
 skewers like these 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.489
 you can leave them like this or paint them with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.489
 acrylic paint or you find out 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.630
 in the first step we will measure the width 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.450
 of the mobile mine is 65 centimeters 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.210
 to the width of the mobile we add 15 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.070
 centimeters and this measure will be the long 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 of the two sticks that we are going to cut 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.869
 now we cut another two half sticks 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.869
 cm longer than the previous ones 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 next on two ice cream sticks 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.370
 We put hot silicone in the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 ends and stick the two sticks 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.810
 smaller rounds 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.270
 it has to be like that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.930
 we do the same with the sticks that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.300
 we had cut larger 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.760
 two ice cream sticks we're going to 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.340
 mark approximately three centimeters 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.930
 we're going to cut it with the scissors and we 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.930
 let's stay with the longest part 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.170
 in the next step the piece more 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.240
 small we put it for the largest and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.620
 let's give it the inclination that we most 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.620
 like to support the mobile 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.600
 We put hot silicone in both 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.010
 sticks that we had cut and we're going 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.010
 to hit in this way 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.349
 and finally we will use a piece of 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.970
 rubber eva of the width of the seat and the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.459
 long enough to not be left 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.080
 tight and can support perfectly 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.390
 the module 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.910
 If you do not have rubber eva or foami by hand 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.540
 You can use a piece of cloth that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.540
 have at home 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.740
 and ready look what support for the mobile 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.740
 more summery 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.209
