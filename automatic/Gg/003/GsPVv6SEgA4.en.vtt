in<00:00:00.210> a<00:00:00.390> way<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:00.780> project<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.319> kind<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.650> giving

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.000 
in a way this project is kind of giving

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.369 
in a way this project is kind of giving
students<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.120> power<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:04.430> be<00:00:05.430> informed<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
students the power to be informed and

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.660 
students the power to be informed and
make<00:00:07.379> them<00:00:07.620> maybe<00:00:07.799> think<00:00:08.189> about<00:00:08.309> questions

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
make them maybe think about questions

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.390 
make them maybe think about questions
that<00:00:09.150> they<00:00:09.269> haven't<00:00:09.540> thought<00:00:09.900> themselves<00:00:10.400> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
that they haven't thought themselves the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.390 
that they haven't thought themselves the
undergraduate<00:00:12.090> course<00:00:12.599> video<00:00:12.960> project<00:00:13.530> was

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
undergraduate course video project was

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.240 
undergraduate course video project was
to<00:00:15.030> create<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.839> short<00:00:16.260> video<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.650> every

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
to create one short video for every

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880 
to create one short video for every
undergraduate<00:00:17.730> course<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.890> for

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
undergraduate course here for

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
undergraduate course here for
prospective<00:00:20.189> students<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.210> answer<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
prospective students to answer the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.599 
prospective students to answer the
question<00:00:22.109> why<00:00:22.350> should<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:22.859> choose<00:00:23.160> this

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
question why should they choose this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.230 
question why should they choose this
course<00:00:24.080> here<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.109> Oxford<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
course here at Oxford I think that the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.179 
course here at Oxford I think that the
main<00:00:27.449> thing<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.689> attracted<00:00:28.289> me<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
main thing that attracted me to the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.330 
main thing that attracted me to the
project<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.970> year<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:31.529> almost

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
project was this year of almost

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.299 
project was this year of almost
impossibility<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.649> peak<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
impossibility of it at the peak of the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
impossibility of it at the peak of the
project<00:00:35.790> i<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.059> doing<00:00:36.360> five<00:00:36.630> interviews<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
project i was doing five interviews a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
project i was doing five interviews a
day<00:00:37.590> before<00:00:38.309> throwing<00:00:38.820> information<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
day before throwing information at you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this very quickly with some small video

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
this very quickly with some small video
camera<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> was

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
camera and then actually you know it was

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.010 
camera and then actually you know it was
a<00:01:30.240> fairly<00:01:30.799> big<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.130> long<00:01:32.340> production<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a fairly big and long production at the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
a fairly big and long production at the
time<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.530> doing<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> interviews<00:01:35.610> almost

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
time of doing the interviews almost

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.260 
time of doing the interviews almost
always<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.170> thought<00:01:37.470> wow<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.400> um<00:01:38.700> Sequoia

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
always I thought wow that's um Sequoia

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
always I thought wow that's um Sequoia
wish<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.810> studied<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
wish I would have studied that the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.010 
wish I would have studied that the
largest<00:01:41.490> galaxies<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> structure<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
largest galaxies the structure of the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
largest galaxies the structure of the
universe<00:01:43.250> studying<00:01:44.250> humans<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.670> all

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

universe studying humans from all
possible<00:01:45.420> perspectives<00:01:46.200> identity<00:01:47.149> purpose

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
possible perspectives identity purpose

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.929 
possible perspectives identity purpose
those<00:01:48.630> are<00:01:48.869> things<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.250> choose<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.850> be

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
those are things or you can choose to be

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.319 
those are things or you can choose to be
absolutely<00:01:51.479> off<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.020> wall<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.490> sort<00:01:54.299> of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
absolutely off the wall and do sort of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.740 
absolutely off the wall and do sort of
medieval<00:01:56.090> history<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.390> modern

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
medieval history with modern

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
medieval history with modern
international<00:01:58.079> relations<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.040> course

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
international relations and of course

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.280 
international relations and of course
there<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.640> things<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.969> people<00:02:00.360> say<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
there are things that people say that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
there are things that people say that
are<00:02:01.500> always<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.490> same<00:02:02.729> such<00:02:03.360> as

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
are always going to be the same such as

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
are always going to be the same such as
some<00:02:03.840> students<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.560> jobs<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> city<00:02:05.310> in
