00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.850
 hi welcome on mac this report 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.450
 for the test of mercedes citan kangoo 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.760
 tuner by mercedes with anyway 200 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.680
 modifications to start with a face 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.140
 specific front with shields 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.670
 much more imposing which increases the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.390
 length of the vehicle of ten 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.880
 centimeters 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.100
 so we have all the advantages of a 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.370
 kangoo to know namely his door 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.739
 sliding back that provides access 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.280
 at a bank is very wide with three 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.830
 real places other practical point the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.330
 modularity since the seats are rocking 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.390
 automatically with the folders for 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.570
 to form an almost flat floor we go 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.690
 watch them trunk a trunk 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.390
 gigantic with a very very high radius 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.260
 very large very large it is a limit 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.200
 tent and there we have almost 700 liters of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.200
 volume with square shapes 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.090
 a very low loading threshold 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.170
 the front seats were also 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.479
 completely revised especially at the level of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.640
 the thickness of the seat of the foam 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.840
 also fabrics that come from 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.369
 mercedes viano and the dashboard 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.789
 also has a nice design to 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.299
 she is then it's still plastic 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.130
 rigid but good at the level of ergonomics 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.049
 it's very simple only thing that is 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.479
 pity it's this car radio second 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.960
 which should be modified on the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.549
 final versions manufacturer a 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.649
 also reviewed the box order 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:52.689
 speeds for it to be a bit more 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.689
 effective so we start sanary 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.310
 so we have the recoil radar which is 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.960
 also an option obviously the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.860
 assisted steering is the same as on 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.830
 the court where she is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.159
 very well light enough with a precise 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.159
 welcome back 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 however the steering wheel is not adjustable 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.040
 in depth in only authors 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.900
 mercedes also reviewed fully 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.330
 chassis with firmer suspensions 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.270
 lower anti-roll bars a little 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.690
 bigger take an important 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.940
 of highways do not have when we have the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.120
 speed stabilized at 120 the vehicle is 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 quite silent however at 130-140 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 to start a lot of noises 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.510
 of air and the engine is heard 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.420
 also obviously if we want to double 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 it's a bit more complicated because 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.530
 the reports are still very long 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.070
 you have to know in class to have 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.350
 also this 5 dci lille motor that we can 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.460
 still be proud that an engine 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.940
 French now to buy used 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.940
 by mercedes 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.010
 then as is marseille 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.190
 enjoy to ask the Marseillais 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.050
 what they think the site has landed 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.190
 a question to the boss of the branch 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.900
 mercedes france utility 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.640
 when you and that's the rc version 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.360
 comfortable in the center best of the mercedes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.900
 but why robust level and this look 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.800
 who she has a nice face and if 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.980
 I tell you it's a kangoo not 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.440
 thought never you thought late 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.820
 when you do not loan a module to 20 if he 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.090
 not see all the tow of the vehicle 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.590
 but I am so deletes me to choose 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.920
 between that and a kangoo you take a 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.810
 progress is there this one rather than April 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.260
 and felt in front of the cool ones and if I read 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.260
 that his kangoo 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.150
 when you too and by mercedes magazine 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.689
 and corrected by mercedes listen 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.790
 11:07 connoisseurs to his excesses of the 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.250
 range mercedes 20 20 it has more mouth 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.780
 that a kangoo ah so largely so to 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.230
 choose between sarria when you take 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.480
 rather that now I know it's 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.730
 a kangoo ze that's because with the price 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:21.959
 the difference between mercedes and renault 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:24.590
 there are two million can wait balloon if he 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.539
 is not a mercedes engine I do not know 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.010
 part in the design but I do not know if there is 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.570
 a lot of differences yeah of course 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.130
 there is the name there is still a pledge of 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.020
 quality 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.520
 when we know that a few kangoo 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.870
 thousands of kilometers he said everything 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.710
 live and the engine week yes 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.700
 laquerre these inmates thank you very much to 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.490
 right the pleasure of passing on my site 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.640
 sir franÃ§ois boss of the branch 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.810
 mercedes france utility 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.550
 when do we have an amg version of 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.590
 this sit and we will not have a version 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.760
 would clearly like to have no version 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.260
 but maybe we can have fun doing it 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.630
 more athletic versions 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.250
 oh that's an info already and then this 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.660
 which is a pity finds these two do not 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.740
 find that in the utility network 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.630
 why not put them in concession 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.250
 you have a part of the network that is 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.570
 mixed on some important cities 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.330
 requests the largest bank of 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.130
 france who resolves minister is both 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.710
 cars and trucks or islands 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.910
 will be an opportunity to present in 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.500
