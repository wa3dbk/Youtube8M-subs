00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.750
 border guards to leave the house in the morning 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.270

 what questions do not work for us 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.770
 identification marks or titles well slag 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.439
 Ukraine, you're just a symbol of the country bend 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.720
 I do not see where the chevron fans 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.880
 but I go fishing almost the same 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 recruiting office staff 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 I did not have any certificates , but the drill 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.009
 agendas more than 50 people with a plan for 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.850
 mobilization Venkova you can not cope 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.700
 send into battle it is now given by failure 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.549
 1500 pieces 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.380
 load 1500 summonses were sent and 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.479
 stupendously colossal failure to appear 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.310
 have to improvise future 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.649
 defenders of the homeland are caught on the track 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.269
 mass events will have a floor right 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:17.260
 in public transport 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:20.380
 where is indicated regional military commissar foam and 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.880
 on top and came here it confused me 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.980
 that Kharkov young punx same day 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.650

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.900
 no subpoenas handing anyone on the subway 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.090
 can not and given the fact that his 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.480
 the signature as it stood on the spine that 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.640
 I stayed I was perplexed I decided 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.810
 let's take off nowhere not to go on that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.730
 Kharkiv draft board for beech 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.950
 mobilization plan opinions found out 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.870
 the musicians of the local philharmonic would seem 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.450
 what attitude cellists and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.860
 horn player and have to military professions 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.260
 but the agenda got 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.239
 and they we are each of the delay musicians 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.340
 mass market and singing choir state 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.349
 Gog paid a lot of money for 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.450
 decades per person so that later it 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.760
 just piles of the service is now takin 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.980
 even fathers with many children also because 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.510
 there is no one to choose who is legally 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.060
 and health fit 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.700
 they are doing everything to this army no 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.130
 relationship not to have I don't understand what 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.950
 going on in the country we have no military 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.239
 provisions going on mobilize put 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.130
 there is no war openly with us 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.319
 anti-terrorist operation with 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.980
 terrorists must fight the special services 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.680
 they are military and so here I don't want to somehow 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 20 years to die roughly clear 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.060
 for what but volunteer fighters 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.920
 battalion Donbass on the words for Ukraine 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.950
 always fight but much more 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.140
 It can not get better than this is another 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.220

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.500

 separatist no unlocked service 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.340
 now militants allegedly live in the territory 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.290

 Semenchenko was first to solve it all 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.220
 then populated 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.500
 no question we seltino we broke the law 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.269
 evict them through them people from 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.040
 volunteer battalions which 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.780
 Minsk agreements should have long 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.340
 be disbanded and walks with 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.889
 weapons in hand and become defendants 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.989

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.120
 Sergey Melnichuk Battalion Commander 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.039
 Aydar 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.139
 used subordinates and civilian 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.940
 under his leadership a gang of several 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.100
 Aydara militants kidnapped people 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.479
 seized the enterprise by among them 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.760
 fairly low percentage 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.010
 really patriots there or ideological 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.510

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.169
 the number of people who went to these 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.800
 battalions 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.639
 tackle your narrow corporate interests 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.969
 That's why we 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.360
 we read 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.009

 there is a crime being committed 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:59.159

 Aydar these stories that beat now 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.389
 around him those who still fall into 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:08.879
 army command periodically forgets 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.829
