00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 good folks one more time with good night 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.299
 for you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.030
 Brazil and the world at home that I 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.269
 give of your videos on youtube of stones 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 gross of agnaldo santos today 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.000
 with you, I'm already filming on a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:24.000
 photo taken from an internet search 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.400
 a stone that was auctioned and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.029
 sold by a fan for 2 million 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.929
 dollars and was sold and the announcement went to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 internet ne 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 was auctioned for 2 million 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 of dollars for a fan of tickets 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.579
 at that time, it was not by the American 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.430
 millionaire of total control is of lion 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 but up there it says so no more 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.110
 important 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.140
 see things that are worth nothing but 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:57.120
 were sold at absurd prices, right? 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 this is the rock that made it better. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.730
 language is of the beats and noca here in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.510
 low has a line lyon tried there the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.049
 that says the auction was 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 auctioned for 2 million dollars for one 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.990
 fan of ghettos tickets at the time either 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 the 14 American activists, right? 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.330
 so he was a big fan of a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 dream millionaire he learned that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.689
 this thesis was the only stone wants to be 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.479
 Tower of bits to be 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.130
 then this stone was and not auctioned it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.740
 went there and bought 2 million 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.960
 dollars on the hour in stone plus a stone 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.259
 simple black as a small with 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.329
 sure a small drop and was on the icon 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.820
 protects better is paid two million 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.490
 dollars and stayed close and bought and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.950
 better but I said already that she did not 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.960
 say nothing because a simple stone 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.079
 we have a ore stone as we did not have the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.640
 diamond number was not my race 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.250
 only a black stone as a tall 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 Technical grade right 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.549
 So what happens then, then? 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 by case one day 11 is the guy was a fan 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.060
 he paid is of a value and paccola has a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.670
 great value 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.459
 He paid for it now. I ask. 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.459
 leave the house that you will always have me 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.379
 your videos on youtube - ores because 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.420
 has no value 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.970
 You have people who do not believe not 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.730
 values â€‹â€‹do not give value of my ores 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.000
 they find it strange that this exe file is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.099
 This is the real master of the five 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.019
 10 20:50 real cell 10 is 15 parathion 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.780
 finish gives the face of these sectors and nothing 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.090
 then asks if this stone that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.959
 People are already saying it's not worth it. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.299
 anything 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.030
 a stone as neither speak research in the 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.940
 internet she was taken in the face stones 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.730
 The ad was worthless but 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.560
 sold but not legal 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.930
 sold by price so absurd only this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.299
 stone was sold for 2 million 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.190
 dollars by an american mets fan 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.959
 he bought in an auction for 2 million 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.769
 dollars paying the order in dollar 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.840
 American 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.000
 at that time the dollar was higher than 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.859
 today today it looks like dollars to 12 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.440
 a little bit more our money 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.450
 brazilian who in Brazil is an owner 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.739
 at that time it was worth more and less 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.440
 huh 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.370
 when he bought a stone 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440
 common simple 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.720
 now ask me like that, by taking the photo 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.260
 I'm going to put my rock that now 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.910
 raw gold content with a kilogram and 36 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.370
 the group because it is a 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.510
 of this amount in the amount of 100 thousand reais 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.450
 View 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.760
 Surely the people will go even further. 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:45.640
 more than 151 rock 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.340
 then it's there, or 150,000 reais a 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 sale of came out but she still 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.500
 surety is worth another 200,000 if the other 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.239
 Nothing glory was auctioned for 2 million 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 of dollars at auction 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.159
 so imagine a rock of this here what 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.250
 There are lots of gold hermann ruschel too. 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.040
 meteorite nor the beloved rock of 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.109
 gold with the kilo and 36 grams of 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.049
 gross weight already identified with the 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.750
 device propagates the already registered 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.350
 already paid tax and already despite scales 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.199
 and there is the point of Brazil and 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.570
 Joyce Grass and Yellow Mix in 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.880
 part of the morning on the stretch of rock 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.800
 gold points is personal so this here 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.440
 has a lot of value that is real and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.539
 true here has gold and their stone 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.310
 Nothing here is not worth nothing. 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.449
 it was just that he hit one of the tickets 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.510
 laden 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.120
 there a simple black stone of fall and 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.919
 was sold for bought and sold 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.770
 bought for 2 million dollars for one 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.530
 so imagine a rock that it has or 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.630
 you have much value it is sure which 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.240
 It's even more than that stone right there. 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.539
 for what she has for rock and for what 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.539
 she has 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.479
 we will know how to value believing and 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.139
 started to give value and rocks like this 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.760
 so found in nature, right? 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.099
 there are people who think they're worthless 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.160
 but there it is worth much more than a piece 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:14.229
 that there is certainly the one already 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.360
 indicates the survey is worthless but 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.699
 was sold for 2 million dollars 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.440
 this one then surely worth close 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.250
 of 200 thousand or more a rock of this 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.500
 because there is a lot of a draw or even more 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.479
 thank you all until the next 5 of 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.440
 October of precious stones of 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.260
 agnaldo santos 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.260
 let's value what it is to know what 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.000
 valued work new value nÃ© rocks 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.050
 so honored to find two in the 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.630
 Brazil and the world 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.390
 so it has a lot of rock value 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.480
 because here is gold that stone does not 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.870
 there is nothing and this one has gold to draw 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.260
 huh 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.650
