I've now placed the stock in a saucepan

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.300 
I've now placed the stock in a saucepan
which<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.209> simmering<00:03:59.810> nicely<00:04:00.080> there<00:04:00.530> I've<00:04:01.190> I

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
which is a simmering nicely there I've I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.740 
which is a simmering nicely there I've I
did<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.580> little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:01.970> salt<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.390> pepper

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.390 
did a little bit of salt and pepper
that's<00:04:02.900> obviously<00:04:03.349> just<00:04:03.530> enhance<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.160> flavor

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
that's obviously just enhance the flavor

a<00:04:04.610> little<00:04:04.700> bit<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.540> do<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.900> when

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
a little bit I like to do that when

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.900 
a little bit I like to do that when
we're<00:04:06.769> actually<00:04:06.860> boiling<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.400> stuck<00:04:07.610> up<00:04:07.730> to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
we're actually boiling the stuck up to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.820 
we're actually boiling the stuck up to
drink<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.390> rather<00:04:08.959> than<00:04:09.170> doing<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.500> when<00:04:09.650> we

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
drink it rather than doing it when we
