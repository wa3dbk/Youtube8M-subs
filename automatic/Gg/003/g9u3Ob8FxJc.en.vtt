00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.070 
and it wasn't like a big deal it was
just<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.030> people<00:02:10.210> making<00:02:10.630> videos<00:02:10.900> on

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
just like people making videos on

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.380 
just like people making videos on
YouTube<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.770> then<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.700> out<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.360> nowhere

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
YouTube and then like out of nowhere

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.350 
YouTube and then like out of nowhere
things<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.560> changed<00:02:15.550> overnight<00:02:15.880> and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
things just like changed overnight and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.990 
things just like changed overnight and
it<00:02:16.540> was<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:16.930> weird<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.610> things<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.820> like

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
it was really weird and things just like

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.760 
it was really weird and things just like
starting<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> become<00:02:19.540> about<00:02:19.870> popularity<00:02:20.440> and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
starting to become about popularity and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.840 
starting to become about popularity and
like<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.100> was<00:02:21.220> cooler<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:22.360> um<00:02:23.430> who<00:02:24.430> had<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
like it was cooler like um who had the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.640 
like it was cooler like um who had the
better<00:02:25.060> collection<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.020> stuff<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.530> was

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
better collection and stuff and it was

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.430 
better collection and stuff and it was
just<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.920> don't<00:02:27.220> know<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:28.050> got<00:02:29.050> down<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
just I don't know just like got down to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.420 
just I don't know just like got down to
kind<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.940> big<00:02:30.940> comparison<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.430> don't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
kind of a big comparison and I don't

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.950 
kind of a big comparison and I don't
know<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.580> just<00:02:33.700> kind<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.060> got<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.450> little<00:02:34.480> bit

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
know it just kind of got a little bit

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.370 
know it just kind of got a little bit
old<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.400> think<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.720> whole<00:02:37.840> YouTube<00:02:38.350> thing

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
old and I think the whole YouTube thing

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.890 
old and I think the whole YouTube thing
for<00:02:39.190> me<00:02:39.340> as<00:02:39.460> far<00:02:39.610> as<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> reptiles<00:02:40.270> has<00:02:40.630> gotten

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
for me as far as the reptiles has gotten

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.800 
for me as far as the reptiles has gotten
a<00:02:40.930> little<00:02:41.050> bit<00:02:41.230> stagnant<00:02:41.590> um<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:43.270> kind<00:02:43.690> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
a little bit stagnant um it's kind of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.860 
a little bit stagnant um it's kind of
tough<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.380> post<00:02:44.620> videos<00:02:44.800> on<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.060> same<00:02:46.420> things

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
tough to post videos on the same things

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.440 
tough to post videos on the same things
over<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.380> over<00:02:47.650> again<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.370> mean<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.820> have<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.120> lot

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
over and over again I mean I have a lot

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.120 
over and over again I mean I have a lot
of<00:02:49.480> things<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.020> post<00:02:50.140> videos<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.890> have

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
of things I can post videos on I have

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.270 
of things I can post videos on I have
different<00:02:51.940> ideas<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.410> lot<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.190> just

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
different ideas but a lot of it's just

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.210 
different ideas but a lot of it's just
it's<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:54.850> been<00:02:55.150> done<00:02:55.180> before<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.050> it's<00:02:56.800> it's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
really tough to just like kind of move

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.000 
really tough to just like kind of move
