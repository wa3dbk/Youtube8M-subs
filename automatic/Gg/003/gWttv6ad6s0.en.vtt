00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.299 
Galaxy Tab 10 1 if you look at my other
review<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.719> was<00:00:09.990> showing<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.469> folio<00:00:10.889> stand

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
review I was showing the folio stand

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.940 
review I was showing the folio stand
which<00:00:11.580> was<00:00:11.790> considerably<00:00:12.210> thicker<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.530> had

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
which was considerably thicker and had

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.700 
which was considerably thicker and had
some<00:00:14.250> some<00:00:15.030> say<00:00:15.210> some<00:00:15.240> bulking<00:00:15.839> problems

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
some some say some bulking problems

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
some some say some bulking problems
where<00:00:16.949> some<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> cutouts<00:00:17.910> were<00:00:18.119> we're<00:00:18.810> not

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
where some of the cutouts were we're not

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.029 
where some of the cutouts were we're not
fitting<00:00:19.320> quite<00:00:19.529> right

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
fitting quite right

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.540 
fitting quite right
I<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.789> happily<00:00:21.000> say<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:22.109> case<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.100> much

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
I can happily say that this case is much

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150 
I can happily say that this case is much
more<00:00:23.820> better<00:00:24.140> when<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.230> comes<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.830> cutouts

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
more better when it comes to the cutouts

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
more better when it comes to the cutouts
and<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.640> device<00:00:27.210> fits<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.779> most<00:00:28.680> cases

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and how the device fits as most cases

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.529 
and how the device fits as most cases
you<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.150> flap<00:00:30.359> right

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you know it has this little flap right

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.530 
you know it has this little flap right
here<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.900> she<00:00:31.050> used<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> keep<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.180> tab<00:00:33.180> in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
here that she used to keep the tab in

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.170 
here that she used to keep the tab in
its<00:00:33.809> place<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.260> I'll<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.410> put<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
its place so I'll just put this on and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.630 
its place so I'll just put this on and
I'll<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> here<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.050> connectors

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
I'll show you here are your connectors

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.530 
I'll show you here are your connectors
for<00:00:39.320> your<00:00:40.320> charging<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.059> negative<00:00:42.210> thing

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
for your charging the one negative thing

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.880 
for your charging the one negative thing
about<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.500> close<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
about it is that when you do close the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
about it is that when you do close the
case<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.309> can't<00:00:44.520> charge<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> case

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
case it can't charge it with the case

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
case it can't charge it with the case
flow<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.469> has<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.039> open<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> don't

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
flow so it has to be open but I don't

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.950 
flow so it has to be open but I don't
think<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.000> big<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> deal<00:00:48.750> because

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
think it's that big of a deal because

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360 
think it's that big of a deal because
you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.770> you're<00:00:49.890> charging<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can just when you're charging it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
you can just when you're charging it
overnight<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.390> rest<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
overnight just rest it like this to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.939 
overnight just rest it like this to
actually<00:00:52.649> charge<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.410> access<00:00:55.620> to

microphone you have your other speaker

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
microphone you have your other speaker
on<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.909> side<00:01:12.180> although<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.110> would<00:01:13.320> say<00:01:13.350> on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on this side although I would say on

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.190 
on this side although I would say on
this<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.189> looks<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:15.200> pretty

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
this side it looks like it's pretty

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
this side it looks like it's pretty
close<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.799> notice<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.850> seems

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
close if you notice right there it seems

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.179 
close if you notice right there it seems
to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.360> very<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.810> close<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> speaker<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to be very very close to the speaker and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.359 
to be very very close to the speaker and
I<00:01:20.729> guess<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.659> complaint<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.950> we

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I guess my one complaint is that as we

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890 
I guess my one complaint is that as we
compare<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.210> didn't<00:01:24.689> notice<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
compare it to this I didn't notice that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.990 
compare it to this I didn't notice that
the<00:01:25.049> cutout<00:01:25.380> has<00:01:25.590> more<00:01:26.310> than<00:01:26.460> enough<00:01:26.670> space<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the cutout has more than enough space to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
the cutout has more than enough space to
clear<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> speaker<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.860> side<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.700> really

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
clear the speaker on this side it really

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
clear the speaker on this side it really
doesn't<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:31.409> interesting<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.860> some

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
doesn't be interesting to get some

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.469 
doesn't be interesting to get some
feedback<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.939> you're<00:01:33.210> seeing

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
feedback from you all if you're seeing

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
feedback from you all if you're seeing
that<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> purchase<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.500> case<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that if you purchase this case it's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.050 
that if you purchase this case it's
different<00:01:35.250> maybe<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> manufacturing

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
different maybe it's a manufacturing

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
different maybe it's a manufacturing
problem<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.280> seem<00:01:38.520> pretty<00:01:38.759> even

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
problem but it they seem pretty even

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
problem but it they seem pretty even
it's<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> cutout<00:01:40.710> seems

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it's just that this one the cutout seems

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.060 
it's just that this one the cutout seems
to<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.280> too<00:01:42.119> high<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.630> nevertheless<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.979> still

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to be too high up nevertheless it still

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679 
to be too high up nevertheless it still
gives<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.670> enough<00:01:44.850> room<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.390> speaker

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
gives you enough room for your speaker

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.139 
gives you enough room for your speaker
to<00:01:45.960> play<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.549> cutout<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to play you do have your cutout in the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.230 
to play you do have your cutout in the
back<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.590> your

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
back as you can see right here for your

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.389 
back as you can see right here for your
camera<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.829> lip

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
camera and then you have this little lip

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.710 
camera and then you have this little lip
right<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:53.939> I'll<00:01:54.180> explain<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.570> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
right here which I'll explain how this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
right here which I'll explain how this
works<00:01:54.990> later<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:55.649> common<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
works later but this is pretty common in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.010 
works later but this is pretty common in
most<00:01:56.219> cases<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.329> we'll<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.600> over<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> in

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
most cases so but we'll go over that in

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.389 
most cases so but we'll go over that in
a<00:01:58.170> couple<00:01:58.320> seconds<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.880> front<00:02:00.180> has<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.399> same

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a couple seconds the front has the same

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.990 
a couple seconds the front has the same
rubber<00:02:02.880> grip<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.200> other<00:02:04.409> case<00:02:04.710> had<00:02:05.009> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
rubber grip that the other case had so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
rubber grip that the other case had so
as<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.659> position<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> case<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.890> kind<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
as you position the case it kind of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.830 
as you position the case it kind of
stops<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.789> different<00:02:09.090> viewing<00:02:09.239> angles<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
stops for different viewing angles and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.550 
stops for different viewing angles and
you<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.530> I'd<00:02:11.220> say<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.700> all

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
you have I'd say this at all

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320 
you have I'd say this at all
elastic<00:02:13.040> band<00:02:13.250> that's<00:02:13.370> used<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.760> shut<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.150> that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
elastic band that's used to shut it that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.870 
elastic band that's used to shut it that
also<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.069> used<00:02:16.190> as<00:02:16.459> almost<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.790> a

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
also can be used as almost like a

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.770 
also can be used as almost like a
stopper<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.080> notice<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.860> pretty<00:02:19.160> firm

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
stopper so you notice it's pretty firm

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.170 
stopper so you notice it's pretty firm
you<00:02:20.780> also<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.170> another<00:02:21.350> position<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.340> you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you also have another position that you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.240 
you also have another position that you
can<00:02:23.330> put<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.569> case<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.800> were<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.040> grab

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
can put the case in so if I were to grab

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.940 
can put the case in so if I were to grab
this<00:02:25.970> little<00:02:26.300> flap<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.319> put<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.740> this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
this little flap and put it like this

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.729 
this little flap and put it like this
this<00:02:28.640> gives<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> nice<00:02:29.569> viewing<00:02:30.050> angle<00:02:30.530> so

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
this gives you a nice viewing angle so

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.320 
this gives you a nice viewing angle so
if<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.310> want<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.700> watch<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.690> movie<00:02:33.550> also<00:02:34.550> but

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
if you want to watch a movie also but

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.870 
if you want to watch a movie also but
more<00:02:35.660> importantly<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.890> really<00:02:37.100> overcomes<00:02:37.670> one

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
more importantly it really overcomes one

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.340 
more importantly it really overcomes one
of<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.030> challenges<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.930> other<00:02:39.080> case

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
of the challenges that the other case

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.750 
of the challenges that the other case
had<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.890> giving<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.640> ability

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
had and that is giving you the ability

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.240 
had and that is giving you the ability
to<00:02:41.120> actually<00:02:41.420> type<00:02:41.959> from<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.890> very

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
to actually type from it this is a very

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.070 
to actually type from it this is a very
good<00:02:43.520> typing<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:44.330> if<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.510> compare<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.050> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
good typing in when if we compare it to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500 
good typing in when if we compare it to
the<00:02:45.410> other<00:02:45.890> case<00:02:46.670> our<00:02:46.880> showing<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.330> guys

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the other case our showing you guys

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.420 
the other case our showing you guys
earlier<00:02:48.019> on<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.320> yo<00:02:48.410> bow<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.150> get<00:02:50.300> this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
earlier on the yo bow and we get this

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.520 
earlier on the yo bow and we get this
notice<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.519> viewing<00:02:52.790> angle<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:54.170> typing

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
notice a viewing angle and the typing

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.100 
notice a viewing angle and the typing
angle<00:02:54.830> there<00:02:55.160> they're<00:02:56.030> almost<00:02:56.209> exactly<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
angle there they're almost exactly the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.390 
angle there they're almost exactly the
same<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.959> iPad<00:02:59.959> again<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.800> Samsung<00:03:01.250> Galaxy

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
same so iPad again the Samsung Galaxy

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.820 
same so iPad again the Samsung Galaxy
Tab<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.540> case<00:03:02.810> gives<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.350> pretty<00:03:03.560> much<00:03:03.769> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
Tab this case gives you pretty much the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.949 
Tab this case gives you pretty much the
same<00:03:04.069> experience<00:03:04.819> when<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.480> comes<00:03:05.569> from<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
same experience when it comes from a

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.479 
same experience when it comes from a
typing<00:03:06.290> experience<00:03:06.709> is<00:03:06.830> not<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.220> prone

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
typing experience is not so prone

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.449 
typing experience is not so prone
towards<00:03:07.819> carpal<00:03:08.209> tunnel<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.470> one<00:03:09.680> negative

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
towards carpal tunnel the one negative

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.970 
towards carpal tunnel the one negative
and<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.300> guess<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> matter<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.709> guess

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
and I guess this is a matter of I guess

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.000 
and I guess this is a matter of I guess
color<00:03:13.670> choice<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.780> really<00:03:15.410> don't<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.830> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
color choice is I really don't like the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.400 
color choice is I really don't like the
blue<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.400> wish<00:03:16.730> was<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.120> all<00:03:17.360> black<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.049> don't

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
blue I wish was this all black I don't

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.470 
blue I wish was this all black I don't
know<00:03:18.560> why<00:03:19.160> Belkin<00:03:19.670> didn't<00:03:19.910> offer<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.329> in

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
know why Belkin didn't offer this in

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.970 
know why Belkin didn't offer this in
multiple<00:03:20.660> colors<00:03:21.200> have<00:03:21.350> been<00:03:21.500> great<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.950> have

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
multiple colors have been great to have

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.690 
multiple colors have been great to have
this<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.519> red<00:03:23.180> black<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.560> know<00:03:24.680> all<00:03:25.489> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
this in red black you know all the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.130 
this in red black you know all the
colors<00:03:25.880> if<00:03:26.209> someone<00:03:26.660> was<00:03:26.780> interested<00:03:27.079> in

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
colors if someone was interested in

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.750 
colors if someone was interested in
something<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:27.530> color<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:28.400> don't<00:03:28.610> really

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
something with color but don't really

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.100 
something with color but don't really
care<00:03:29.030> for<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.209> blue<00:03:29.450> but<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.900> pretty

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
care for the blue but this is pretty

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.479 
care for the blue but this is pretty
much<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.320> only<00:03:30.560> case<00:03:30.739> that's<00:03:30.769> out<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.310> that

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
much the only case that's out there that

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.630 
much the only case that's out there that
fits<00:03:32.450> well<00:03:32.630> in<00:03:32.720> my<00:03:32.840> opinion<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:34.010> other<00:03:34.130> part

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
fits well in my opinion the other part

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.960 
fits well in my opinion the other part
of<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:35.180> if<00:03:35.360> we<00:03:35.480> were<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.690> compare<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.049> cases

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
of it is if we were to compare the cases

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.180 
of it is if we were to compare the cases
and<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.060> think<00:03:38.299> about<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.660> bulk<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.470> talked

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
and you think about the bulk I talked

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.520 
and you think about the bulk I talked
about<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.579> case<00:03:40.820> earlier<00:03:41.239> it's<00:03:41.359> pretty<00:03:41.540> it's

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
about this case earlier it's pretty it's

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.380 
about this case earlier it's pretty it's
pretty<00:03:42.590> comparable<00:03:43.190> if<00:03:43.579> you<00:03:43.700> notice<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.120> the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
pretty comparable if you notice in the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.910 
pretty comparable if you notice in the
height<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:44.870> you're<00:03:45.019> looking<00:03:45.079> at<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.410> device

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
height so you're looking at this device

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.890 
height so you're looking at this device
in<00:03:46.160> this<00:03:46.310> device<00:03:46.609> it<00:03:47.060> doesn't<00:03:47.239> add<00:03:47.540> too<00:03:47.780> much

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
in this device it doesn't add too much

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.170 
in this device it doesn't add too much
buff<00:03:48.230> though<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:49.190> other<00:03:49.370> area<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.910> I'd<00:03:50.000> say

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
buff though the other area that I'd say

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.810 
buff though the other area that I'd say
is<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:51.200> would<00:03:51.470> say<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.709> New<00:03:51.829> York<00:03:51.980> light<00:03:52.640> for

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
is I would say that New York light for

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.509 
is I would say that New York light for
me<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.030> when<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.690> do<00:03:53.870> close<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.500> this<00:03:54.980> flap

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
me is when you do close it this flap

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.640 
me is when you do close it this flap
kind<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.000> has<00:03:56.329> all<00:03:56.630> this<00:03:56.780> excess<00:03:57.140> material

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
kind of has all this excess material

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.710 
kind of has all this excess material
that<00:03:57.799> wraps<00:03:58.040> around<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.730> then<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.359> definitely

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
that wraps around and then it definitely

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.240 
that wraps around and then it definitely
adds<00:04:00.260> some<00:04:00.850> thickness<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.359> actual<00:04:03.250> galaxy

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
adds some thickness to the actual galaxy

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.890 
adds some thickness to the actual galaxy
tab<00:04:04.489> but<00:04:04.670> it's<00:04:04.790> nothing<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.299> comparison<00:04:05.570> to

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
tab but it's nothing in comparison to

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.530 
tab but it's nothing in comparison to
the<00:04:05.989> other<00:04:06.140> one<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:07.220> does<00:04:07.459> have<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:08.120> blue

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
the other one it does have that blue

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.720 
the other one it does have that blue
feature<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.769> don't<00:04:09.829> know<00:04:10.010> if<00:04:10.100> we<00:04:10.160> can<00:04:10.310> see<00:04:10.549> that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
feature I don't know if we can see that

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.280 
feature I don't know if we can see that
but<00:04:10.940> there's<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.180> kind<00:04:11.359> of<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.540> blue<00:04:11.810> texture

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
but there's a kind of a blue texture

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.949 
but there's a kind of a blue texture
that<00:04:12.440> kind<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:12.829> comes<00:04:13.130> right<00:04:13.340> through<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.959> you

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
that kind of comes right through and you

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.420 
that kind of comes right through and you
can<00:04:15.109> definitely<00:04:15.260> see<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.039> you<00:04:16.130> have<00:04:16.280> the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
can definitely see that and you have the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.830 
can definitely see that and you have the
ax

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
ax

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.710 
ax
so<00:04:17.489> he<00:04:18.489> has<00:04:18.639> this<00:04:18.760> little<00:04:18.910> chubby<00:04:19.239> Ness<00:04:19.450> going

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
so he has this little chubby Ness going

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.990 
so he has this little chubby Ness going
on<00:04:19.870> right<00:04:20.109> here<00:04:20.440> from<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.220> sexist<00:04:21.579> material

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
on right here from the sexist material

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.540 
on right here from the sexist material
again<00:04:22.180> don't<00:04:22.740> don't<00:04:23.740> get<00:04:23.830> why<00:04:23.980> they<00:04:24.160> had<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.430> do

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
again don't don't get why they had to do

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.070 
again don't don't get why they had to do
that<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:25.240> would<00:04:25.360> have<00:04:25.450> been<00:04:25.540> nice<00:04:25.690> if<00:04:25.720> they

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
that it would have been nice if they

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.690 
that it would have been nice if they
just<00:04:26.350> continued<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.800> because<00:04:27.070> really<00:04:27.220> without

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
just continued it because really without

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.830 
just continued it because really without
this<00:04:28.090> piece<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:29.380> case<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.880> pretty<00:04:31.210> slim

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
this piece the case is is pretty slim

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.070 
this piece the case is is pretty slim
it<00:04:32.680> is<00:04:32.830> very<00:04:33.040> slim<00:04:33.570> one<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.720> other<00:04:34.870> nice

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
it is very slim one of the other nice

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.110 
it is very slim one of the other nice
features<00:04:35.470> about<00:04:35.590> this<00:04:35.830> case<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.400> we<00:04:36.580> when<00:04:37.030> you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
features about this case is we when you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.850 
features about this case is we when you
think<00:04:37.360> about<00:04:37.570> these<00:04:37.960> ends<00:04:38.350> why<00:04:38.530> do<00:04:38.620> they

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
think about these ends why do they

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.740 
think about these ends why do they
protrude<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.520> much<00:04:39.760> it's<00:04:40.240> really<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.570> protect

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
protrude so much it's really to protect

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.930 
protrude so much it's really to protect
the<00:04:41.050> device<00:04:41.200> if<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.680> were<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.010> drop<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.490> you

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
the device if you were to drop it you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.610 
the device if you were to drop it you
notice<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.720> takes<00:04:44.260> most<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.330> impact

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
notice that it takes most of the impact

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.110 
notice that it takes most of the impact
and<00:04:47.620> it's<00:04:47.980> not<00:04:48.190> really<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.490> device<00:04:48.760> obtained

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
and it's not really the device obtained

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.190 
and it's not really the device obtained
it's<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.930> National<00:04:50.229> material<00:04:50.740> itself<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.540> one

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
it's the National material itself so one

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.620 
it's the National material itself so one
last<00:04:53.380> piece<00:04:53.800> is<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.910> if<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.180> are<00:04:55.330> carrying

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
last piece is that if you are carrying

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.600 
last piece is that if you are carrying
it<00:04:55.750> in<00:04:55.840> your<00:04:55.960> bag<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.130> nice<00:04:57.370> little

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
it in your bag this is a nice little

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.570 
it in your bag this is a nice little
feature<00:04:58.320> this<00:04:59.320> elastic<00:04:59.860> band<00:05:00.130> goes<00:05:00.340> right

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
feature this elastic band goes right

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.580 
feature this elastic band goes right
around<00:05:00.700> it<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.479> then<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.990> keeps<00:05:02.139> your<00:05:02.350> case

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
around it and then it keeps your case

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.900 
around it and then it keeps your case
closed<00:05:02.950> especially<00:05:03.520> if<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.639> don't<00:05:03.760> have<00:05:03.880> a

scratched<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.630> is<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.440> nifty<00:05:08.710> little<00:05:08.889> case<00:05:09.550> so

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
scratched this is a nifty little case so

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.690 
scratched this is a nifty little case so
of<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.960> two<00:05:11.110> cases<00:05:11.380> from<00:05:11.680> Belkin<00:05:11.950> which<00:05:12.520> one

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
of the two cases from Belkin which one

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.909 
of the two cases from Belkin which one
when<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:12.820> recommend<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:13.600> definitely<00:05:14.500> recommend

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
when I recommend I definitely recommend

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.610 
when I recommend I definitely recommend
this<00:05:15.040> case<00:05:15.310> color<00:05:16.030> choice<00:05:16.389> not<00:05:16.930> my<00:05:17.139> preference

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
this case color choice not my preference

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.469 
this case color choice not my preference
but<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:18.190> know<00:05:18.280> everyone<00:05:18.880> has<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.180> different

but you know everyone has a different

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.240 
but you know everyone has a different
opinion<00:05:19.630> when<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.930> comes<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.229> color<00:05:20.410> I<00:05:20.650> like

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
opinion when it comes to color I like

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.390 
opinion when it comes to color I like
how<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.850> really<00:05:22.479> helps<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.590> Galaxy<00:05:23.950> Tab<00:05:24.130> stand

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
how it really helps the Galaxy Tab stand

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400 
how it really helps the Galaxy Tab stand
out<00:05:24.580> from<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:25.150> thickness<00:05:25.570> perspective<00:05:26.260> it's

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
out from a thickness perspective it's

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.260 
out from a thickness perspective it's
not<00:05:26.590> too<00:05:26.830> thick<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.520> doesn't<00:05:27.850> make<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.000> look

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
not too thick it doesn't make it look

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.510 
not too thick it doesn't make it look
that<00:05:28.300> bulky<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.800> wish<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.130> calls<00:05:30.340> were<00:05:30.490> a

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
that bulky I just wish the calls were a

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.219 
that bulky I just wish the calls were a
little<00:05:30.669> bit<00:05:30.850> different<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.600> again<00:05:32.020> as<00:05:32.140> I

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
little bit different and again as I

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.529
