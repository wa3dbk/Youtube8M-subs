00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.640
 to the needs of his two matches in 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:52.019
 terms of staff knowing that a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.370

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.399
 Players players aligned 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
 it's a mini championship it's a mini 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.800
 championship six games points to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.390
 take the maximum 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 you know the problem data 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 on the number of qualified in the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.820
 prospect it before the can in morocco 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.350
 of 2015 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 so what regards the purpose of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.740
 of the list and the movements of players 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.729
 players appeared in the last 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.710
 grouping that were in grouping 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.689
 to the cyclist also constituted by 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 the absence of other players that has us 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.020
 allowed to bring his players whose 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.579
 your cities that are not there 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.579
 currently 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.119
 after it took in relation to the return 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.689
 on the return of all players 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.880
 in terms of possibilities review a 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.320
 little bit the situation of some and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.740
 others through what everyone 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.780
 did and today boys who 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.570
 are not 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.570
 that are not called have been because 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.400
 that also also in terms of the beginning of 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.630
 season they have little time of little 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.570
 playing time and that's what I got 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.720
 explained with them especially between diafra 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.759
 sakho who was in the tent of his 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.970
 transition to the next level 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.370
 that is to say, rank of the French d2 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.739
 to a league 1 franc franÃ§ois-ier it has 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.420
 been done now we will follow him for 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.239
 see a little bit what can 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.550
 give with his new club and the other 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.860
 boy currently who also spent a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.930
 bearing a player or locomotive does not have 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.120
 still engaged series of matches 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.040
 and so that's also an element he has 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.860
 played also compared to the 6 also 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.300
 to return to turn to the share at 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.709
 turn to the availability of others 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.560
 players who were previously called 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.819
 in the group 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.959
 you tell me about the first match 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.300
 the first match always has on 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.280
 importance its importance in terms of 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.290
 moral trust and then obviously 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.440
 of capital points but when I 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.239
 spoke of naming mini 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.290
 championship that is to say that at the 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.700
 difference from the last match of 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.840
 competition that we made that is played 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.560
 on a round trip match ie 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.200
 against the Ivory Coast 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.870
 no we are in one in a series 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.430
 of matches or interest each time 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.170
 but there will be points to take and the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.810
 maximum obviously being the most 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.910
 important so we start from investors 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.260
 to take maximum points on 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.260
 this first meeting 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.870
 without this total having 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.099
 keeping their perspectives as it gets 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 will play on all six matches and not 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.030
 on this first match
