00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
knew it was gonna help me slide better

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.139 
knew it was gonna help me slide better
so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.950> wanted<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.460> try<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.970> so

I just like you know purposely tried to
like<00:01:50.340> stand<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> nose<00:01:51.149> slide<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.780> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like stand on a nose slide and like that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.040 
like stand on a nose slide and like that
okay<00:01:52.320> like

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
okay like

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.290 
okay like
you<00:01:53.350> know<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.520> know<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.880> went<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.270> just

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
you know and it you know it went it just

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.110 
you know and it you know it went it just
kept<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.920> good<00:01:57.130> just<00:01:57.430> one<00:01:58.030> of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
kept going so this is good just one of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.340 
kept going so this is good just one of
those<00:01:58.240> things<00:01:58.480> that<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:58.720> thought<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:59.020> was<00:01:59.140> cool

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
those things that I thought it was cool

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.320 
those things that I thought it was cool
I<00:01:59.410> think<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.830> should<00:02:00.010> always<00:02:00.520> be<00:02:00.670> trying<00:02:01.030> new

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
I think you should always be trying new

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.880 
I think you should always be trying new
stuff<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.930> trying<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.380> make<00:02:02.530> things<00:02:02.770> better

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
stuff and trying to make things better

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.880 
stuff and trying to make things better
and<00:02:03.430> at<00:02:03.880> least<00:02:03.970> experimenting<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.870> know<00:02:04.990> yeah

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
and at least experimenting you know yeah

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.640 
and at least experimenting you know yeah
a<00:02:05.920> black<00:02:06.460> ice<00:02:06.730> is<00:02:06.940> kind<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.330> truth<00:02:07.660> like<00:02:07.990> not

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
a black ice is kind of a truth like not

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.770 
a black ice is kind of a truth like not
only<00:02:08.890> does<00:02:09.040> it<00:02:09.070> like<00:02:09.280> help<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.640> slide<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.510> lot

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
only does it like help you slide a lot

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.710 
only does it like help you slide a lot
better<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:12.190> actual<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.180> black<00:02:13.480> ice

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
better the actual like the black ice

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.680 
better the actual like the black ice
layer<00:02:14.260> makes<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.280> board<00:02:15.490> stronger<00:02:16.060> black<00:02:16.450> ice

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
layer makes the board stronger black ice

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.960 
layer makes the board stronger black ice
holds<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.380> board<00:02:17.650> together<00:02:17.980> structurally

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
holds the board together structurally

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.150 
holds the board together structurally
better<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.810> doesn't<00:02:20.230> let<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> board<00:02:20.890> sort

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
better and it doesn't let the board sort

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040 
better and it doesn't let the board sort
of<00:02:21.250> SOG<00:02:21.460> out<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.880> easy<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.420> flatten<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
of SOG out as easy and flatten out and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.260 
of SOG out as easy and flatten out and
hold<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.380> spot<00:02:23.680> longer<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:24.850> sort<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
hold it spot longer so that's sort of a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.720 
hold it spot longer so that's sort of a
side<00:02:25.480> effect<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.230> six<00:02:26.650> plies<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.280> wood<00:02:27.490> and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
side effect to it six plies of wood and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.340 
side effect to it six plies of wood and
a<00:02:27.790> seven<00:02:28.150> ones<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.540> one<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.810> makes<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.080> strong

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
a seven ones to one that makes a strong

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.840 
a seven ones to one that makes a strong
you<00:02:29.500> know<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> only<00:02:30.580> thing<00:02:30.730> I've<00:02:30.820> been

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
you know that's the only thing I've been

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.640 
you know that's the only thing I've been
skating<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.360> can't<00:02:31.570> skate<00:02:31.750> anything<00:02:32.170> else<00:02:32.440> I'll

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
skating I can't skate anything else I'll

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.650 
skating I can't skate anything else I'll
type<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.460> see<00:02:33.610> people<00:02:33.940> trying<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.270> too<00:02:34.480> you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
type to see people trying this too you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
type to see people trying this too you
know<00:02:34.720> let's<00:02:35.560> see<00:02:35.680> what<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.860> feel<00:02:36.130> when<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.340> slide

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
know let's see what I feel when I slide

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.850 
know let's see what I feel when I slide
my<00:02:36.640> tricks<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.870> makes<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.290> graphic<00:02:38.710> look

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
my tricks it makes a graphic look

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.560 
my tricks it makes a graphic look
different<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:39.940> super<00:02:40.120> shiny

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
different to like it's super shiny

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.120 
different to like it's super shiny
underneath<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.830> once<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.100> start

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
underneath it and so like once you start

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.190 
underneath it and so like once you start
skating<00:02:42.610> off<00:02:42.760> your<00:02:42.940> graphic<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.480> goes<00:02:43.660> into

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
skating off your graphic it goes into

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.250 
skating off your graphic it goes into
the<00:02:44.440> actual<00:02:44.590> black<00:02:44.980> eyes<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.430> board<00:02:45.760> actually

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the actual black eyes to board actually

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.230 
the actual black eyes to board actually
stays<00:02:47.260> looking<00:02:47.620> pretty<00:02:47.830> fresh<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:49.090> know<00:02:49.180> I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
stays looking pretty fresh you know I

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.940 
stays looking pretty fresh you know I
think<00:02:49.360> it's<00:02:49.630> great<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:50.080> Plan<00:02:50.260> B<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.590> try<00:02:50.710> new

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
think it's great for Plan B to try new

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.980 
think it's great for Plan B to try new
stuff<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.550> try<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:51.970> make<00:02:52.060> boards<00:02:52.390> better<00:02:52.600> and

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
stuff and try and make boards better and

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.510 
stuff and try and make boards better and
you<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.800> pushing<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
you you know be pushing that

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.000 
you you know be pushing that
construction<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.570> make<00:02:56.050> life<00:02:56.290> easier<00:02:56.740> on<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
construction and make life easier on the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.510 
construction and make life easier on the
skater<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.880> think<00:02:57.970> that's<00:02:58.239> good
