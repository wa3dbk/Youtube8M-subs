00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
hello guys it's the diamond boat here

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.370 
hello guys it's the diamond boat here
today<00:00:15.790> I<00:00:16.000> will<00:00:16.360> be<00:00:16.480> showing<00:00:16.720> you<00:00:16.869> on<00:00:17.020> how<00:00:17.350> to

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
today I will be showing you on how to

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.850 
today I will be showing you on how to
generate<00:00:18.150> cobblestone<00:00:19.150> walls<00:00:19.599> so<00:00:20.410> keep<00:00:20.680> on

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
generate cobblestone walls so keep on

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.730 
generate cobblestone walls so keep on
watching<00:00:21.660> okay<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.720> start<00:00:23.050> building<00:00:23.439> it<00:00:23.590> you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
watching okay to start building it you

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.800 
watching okay to start building it you
will<00:00:23.919> need<00:00:24.099> some<00:00:24.340> building<00:00:24.730> blocks<00:00:24.849> and<00:00:25.270> lava

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
will need some building blocks and lava

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.089 
will need some building blocks and lava
and<00:00:26.020> water<00:00:26.349> and<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:26.829> will<00:00:26.980> basically

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
and water and that will basically

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.030 
and water and that will basically
generate<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.939> cobblestone<00:00:28.540> wall<00:00:28.750> so<00:00:29.680> first<00:00:29.919> you

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
generate a cobblestone wall so first you

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.440 
generate a cobblestone wall so first you
want<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.220> locate<00:00:30.400> where<00:00:30.759> you<00:00:30.849> want<00:00:31.060> your<00:00:31.239> wall

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
want to locate where you want your wall

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.420 
want to locate where you want your wall
and<00:00:31.750> wherever<00:00:32.140> you<00:00:32.470> want<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:32.980> can<00:00:33.160> have<00:00:33.399> it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
and wherever you want it you can have it

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.000 
and wherever you want it you can have it
as<00:00:33.700> tall<00:00:34.120> as<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.480> want<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.840> as<00:00:35.350> wide<00:00:35.649> as<00:00:35.860> you

going to make it very wide I'm just
going<00:00:40.059> to<00:00:40.120> make<00:00:40.539> it<00:00:40.719> like<00:00:40.840> this<00:00:41.109> now<00:00:41.739> you<00:00:41.800> want

going to make it like this now you want

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.220 
going to make it like this now you want
to<00:00:42.100> go<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.340> one<00:00:42.609> end<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.149> wall<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.870> start

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
to go to one end of the wall and start

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.990 
to go to one end of the wall and start
building<00:00:44.620> up<00:00:44.739> depending<00:00:45.370> on<00:00:45.489> how<00:00:45.699> high<00:00:45.969> you

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
building up depending on how high you

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.139 
building up depending on how high you
want<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.539> call<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.960> stone<00:00:47.230> wall<00:00:47.469> to<00:00:47.710> be<00:00:47.890> so<00:00:48.670> I'm

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
want to call the stone wall to be so I'm

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.119 
want to call the stone wall to be so I'm
just<00:00:49.390> going<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.719> build<00:00:49.839> mine<00:00:50.199> maybe<00:00:50.559> like<00:00:50.859> this

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
just going to build mine maybe like this

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.310 
just going to build mine maybe like this
or<00:00:51.370> something<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:51.910> then<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:52.780> want<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.079> start

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
or something and then you want to start

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.889 
or something and then you want to start
building<00:00:53.559> in<00:00:53.949> this<00:00:54.219> direction<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:55.030> little<00:00:55.750> bit

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
building in this direction a little bit

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.610 
building in this direction a little bit
longer<00:00:56.260> than<00:00:56.620> what<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.249> actually<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.760> so<00:00:58.179> on

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
longer than what this actually is so on

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.290 
longer than what this actually is so on
one<00:00:59.620> block<00:00:59.920> longer<00:01:00.460> than<00:01:00.670> what<00:01:00.940> your<00:01:01.089> wall

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
one block longer than what your wall

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.320 
one block longer than what your wall
will<00:01:01.600> be<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:02.109> my<00:01:02.530> case<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:03.100> would<00:01:03.339> be<00:01:03.370> like<00:01:03.999> this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
will be so my case it would be like this

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.110 
will be so my case it would be like this
and<00:01:04.600> then<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.590> want<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.890> start<00:01:06.430> building<00:01:06.730> one

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
and then you want to start building one

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.920 
and then you want to start building one
more<00:01:07.540> up<00:01:07.720> over<00:01:08.050> here<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:10.270> more<00:01:10.450> up<00:01:10.630> over

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
more up over here and one more up over

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.510 
more up over here and one more up over
here<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.320> then<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.920> want<00:01:12.040> to<00:01:12.160> build<00:01:12.310> out

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
here and then you want to build out

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.880 
here and then you want to build out
three<00:01:13.180> out<00:01:13.450> like<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.290> start<00:01:14.680> building

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
three out like that and start building

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.720 
three out like that and start building
in<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.340> direction<00:01:15.820> as<00:01:15.970> well<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.460> and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
in this direction as well like this and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.540 
in this direction as well like this and
place<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.510> same<00:01:19.750> thing<00:01:20.080> on<00:01:20.320> each<00:01:20.620> of<00:01:20.830> these<00:01:20.980> so

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
place the same thing on each of these so

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.760 
place the same thing on each of these so
now<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:21.820> want<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.060> close<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.480> in<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.020> build

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
now you want to close this in and build

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.250 
now you want to close this in and build
like<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> cage<00:01:24.700> around<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:25.660> that<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:26.080> lava

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
like a cage around it so that the lava

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.460 
like a cage around it so that the lava
does<00:01:26.440> not<00:01:26.710> go<00:01:26.860> in<00:01:27.010> different<00:01:27.160> directions<00:01:27.400> on

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
does not go in different directions on

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.830 
does not go in different directions on
and<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:30.520> for<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.760> other<00:01:30.940> side<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.600> make

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
and same for the other side so and make

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.660 
and same for the other side so and make
sure<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.140> have<00:01:35.230> these<00:01:35.500> clothes<00:01:35.890> out<00:01:36.130> it

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
sure to have these clothes out it

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.180 
sure to have these clothes out it
doesn't<00:01:37.030> really<00:01:37.180> matter<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.230> recommend

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
doesn't really matter but I recommend

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.490 
doesn't really matter but I recommend
having<00:01:39.370> them<00:01:39.670> close<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:40.240> now<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:40.990> want<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.350> go

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
having them close so now you want to go

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.480 
having them close so now you want to go
and<00:01:41.800> build

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
and build

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.790 
and build
I<00:01:42.520> mean<00:01:43.090> place<00:01:43.390> lava<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.050> one<00:01:44.200> side<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.620> this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
I mean place lava and one side of this

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.020 
I mean place lava and one side of this
um<00:01:45.510> wall<00:01:46.510> generator<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:48.310> basically<00:01:48.520> just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
um wall generator and you basically just

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.550 
um wall generator and you basically just
want<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.330> wait<00:01:49.480> for<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.020> flow<00:01:50.230> all<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
want to wait for this to flow all the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.670 
want to wait for this to flow all the
way<00:01:50.680> down<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:52.330> I'll<00:01:52.600> see<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.810> guys<00:01:52.930> once<00:01:53.470> it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
way down so I'll see you guys once it's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.640 
way down so I'll see you guys once it's
flown<00:01:53.950> all<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.250> way<00:01:54.370> down<00:01:54.810> okay<00:01:55.810> now<00:01:56.050> that<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
flown all the way down okay now that the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.010 
flown all the way down okay now that the
lava<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.070> done<00:01:57.220> flowing<00:01:57.640> all<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.790> way<00:01:58.000> down<00:01:58.270> we

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
lava is done flowing all the way down we

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.420 
lava is done flowing all the way down we
can<00:01:59.200> actually<00:01:59.230> start<00:01:59.740> with<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.950> other<00:02:00.070> stuff

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
can actually start with the other stuff

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.980 
can actually start with the other stuff
and<00:02:00.580> depending<00:02:01.180> on<00:02:01.270> how<00:02:01.450> high<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:01.750> thing

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
and depending on how high this thing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.070 
and depending on how high this thing
will<00:02:02.410> be<00:02:02.560> um<00:02:03.150> that's<00:02:04.150> how<00:02:04.360> long<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:04.810> going<00:02:04.990> to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
will be um that's how long it's going to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.600 
will be um that's how long it's going to
take<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:05.710> build<00:02:05.890> lay<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.130> couple<00:02:06.430> of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
take so if you build lay a couple of

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.089 
take so if you build lay a couple of
hundred<00:02:07.060> blocks<00:02:07.480> high<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:08.349> can<00:02:08.590> take<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.830> while

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
hundred blocks high it can take a while

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.820 
hundred blocks high it can take a while
because<00:02:09.280> lava<00:02:09.789> does<00:02:10.060> not<00:02:10.090> flow<00:02:10.450> very<00:02:10.720> fast<00:02:11.080> so

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
because lava does not flow very fast so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.010 
because lava does not flow very fast so
now<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.040> generate<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.790> wall<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.510> want<00:02:13.840> to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
now to generate the wall you want to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.800 
now to generate the wall you want to
place<00:02:14.200> down<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.710> bucket<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.280> water<00:02:15.490> here<00:02:15.810> wait

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
place down a bucket of water here wait

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.660 
place down a bucket of water here wait
until<00:02:17.260> three<00:02:17.590> blocks<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.190> been

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
until three blocks have been

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.949 
until three blocks have been
form<00:02:19.450> there's<00:02:19.810> two<00:02:21.390> three<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.569> then<00:02:22.720> place

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
form there's two three and then place

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.070 
form there's two three and then place
another<00:02:23.290> one<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:25.239> wait<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> three

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
another one and then wait for the three

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.670 
another one and then wait for the three
to<00:02:26.349> form<00:02:26.620> over<00:02:26.770> there<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.470> then<00:02:29.470> place

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
to form over there and then place

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.550 
to form over there and then place
another<00:02:30.010> one<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.230> wanna<00:02:32.410> keep

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
another one so now you just wanna keep

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.410 
another one so now you just wanna keep
on<00:02:32.739> doing<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.130> depending<00:02:33.610> on<00:02:33.700> how<00:02:33.910> far<00:02:34.209> your

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
on doing this depending on how far your

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.830 
on doing this depending on how far your
wall<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.530> or<00:02:35.739> how<00:02:35.950> long<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.630> will

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
wall is or how long it is but this will

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
wall is or how long it is but this will
save<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> lot<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.500> cobblestone<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.550> lot

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
save you a lot of cobblestone and a lot

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.720 
save you a lot of cobblestone and a lot
of<00:02:40.000> time<00:02:40.600> as<00:02:40.870> well<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.160> great<00:02:42.520> for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
of time as well and this is great for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.460 
of time as well and this is great for
factions<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.660> guys<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.110> love<00:02:44.290> playing

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
factions for you guys that love playing

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.220 
factions for you guys that love playing
factions<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:46.480> way<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.690> generate

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
factions on this is one way to generate

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.110 
factions on this is one way to generate
walls<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.830> protection<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.550> stuff<00:02:48.849> so<00:02:51.120> like

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
walls for protection and stuff so like

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.300 
walls for protection and stuff so like
if<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.450> look<00:02:52.690> here<00:02:52.900> now<00:02:52.959> as<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.680> see<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.010> done

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
if I look here now as you see it's done

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.150 
if I look here now as you see it's done
generating<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.150> one<00:02:55.360> side<00:02:55.600> completely

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
generating on one side completely

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.309 
generating on one side completely
already<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.489> now<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.880> can<00:02:58.180> go<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.900> side<00:02:59.170> and

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
already so now I can go to this side and

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.650 
already so now I can go to this side and
do<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.620> as<00:02:59.830> well<00:03:00.370> I'm<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.330> just<00:03:01.450> get<00:03:01.630> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
do this as well I'm going to just get a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.309 
do this as well I'm going to just get a
empty<00:03:02.380> bucket<00:03:02.830> for<00:03:03.069> later<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.870> play<00:03:05.080> some

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
empty bucket for later and play some

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.630 
empty bucket for later and play some
water<00:03:05.769> over<00:03:06.280> there<00:03:07.950> wait<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:08.980> three<00:03:09.400> blocks

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
water over there wait for three blocks

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.420 
water over there wait for three blocks
of<00:03:09.819> January<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.480> another<00:03:10.930> one<00:03:11.200> just<00:03:12.160> this

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
of January and another one just this

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.530 
of January and another one just this
last<00:03:12.819> layer<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.510> lava<00:03:13.840> will<00:03:14.350> come<00:03:14.650> out<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> bit

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
last layer of lava will come out a bit

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.910 
last layer of lava will come out a bit
Alma

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
Alma

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.800 
Alma
it<00:03:17.920> won't<00:03:18.190> come<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.519> completely<00:03:18.850> good<00:03:19.540> it

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
it won't come out completely good it

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.800 
it won't come out completely good it
will<00:03:20.080> have<00:03:21.069> some<00:03:21.549> blocks<00:03:21.819> missing<00:03:22.360> or<00:03:22.510> even

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
will have some blocks missing or even

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.380 
will have some blocks missing or even
the<00:03:22.930> complete<00:03:23.260> layer<00:03:23.560> missing<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.820> depends

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
the complete layer missing it depends

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.210 
the complete layer missing it depends
because<00:03:25.510> basically<00:03:26.290> what<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.620> layer<00:03:26.890> does

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
because basically what this layer does

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.130 
because basically what this layer does
it<00:03:27.430> keep<00:03:27.640> some<00:03:27.850> lava<00:03:28.060> over<00:03:28.359> here<00:03:28.570> becomes<00:03:28.870> lava

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
it keep some lava over here becomes lava

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.650 
it keep some lava over here becomes lava
flows<00:03:29.500> down<00:03:29.739> pretty<00:03:30.340> fast<00:03:30.609> too<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.510> do

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
flows down pretty fast too if you do

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.400 
flows down pretty fast too if you do
these<00:03:31.930> walls<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:33.600> it's<00:03:34.600> pretty<00:03:34.780> much<00:03:34.989> as<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
these walls but it's pretty much as the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.500 
these walls but it's pretty much as the
last<00:03:35.620> layer<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.459> will<00:03:36.670> not<00:03:36.820> come<00:03:37.060> out<00:03:37.090> too

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
last layer that will not come out too

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.979 
last layer that will not come out too
good<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.049> let<00:03:39.010> me<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.310> generate<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.880> one

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.780 

there<00:03:43.989> goes<00:03:44.170> another<00:03:44.200> water<00:03:44.799> bucket<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.459> now

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
there goes another water bucket and now

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.550 
there goes another water bucket and now
this<00:03:46.209> last<00:03:46.480> one<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.079> want<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.380> wait

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
this last one you want to wait

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.729 
this last one you want to wait
completely<00:03:48.340> for<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.940> last<00:03:49.209> for<00:03:50.109> everything

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
completely for the last for everything

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.110 
completely for the last for everything
to<00:03:50.859> finish<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.370> then<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:51.609> want<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.880> do<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to finish and then you want to do the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.740 
to finish and then you want to do the
last<00:03:52.359> one

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
last one

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.620 
last one
some<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.230> them<00:03:53.350> will<00:03:53.530> form<00:03:53.859> and<00:03:54.070> some<00:03:54.310> won't

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
some of them will form and some won't

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.569 
some of them will form and some won't
because<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.900> does<00:03:56.140> not<00:03:56.290> have<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> lava<00:03:57.220> source

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
because it does not have a lava source

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.060 
because it does not have a lava source
flowing<00:03:58.150> decided<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.959> will<00:03:59.140> like<00:03:59.320> help<00:03:59.799> him

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
flowing decided that will like help him

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.140 
flowing decided that will like help him
as<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.370> see<00:04:00.549> over<00:04:00.760> here<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:02.819> let's<00:04:03.819> just<00:04:04.000> wait

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
as you see over here so let's just wait

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.569 
as you see over here so let's just wait
for<00:04:04.390> this<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.540> finish<00:04:05.140> forming<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.220> wall

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
for this to finish forming this wall

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.280 
for this to finish forming this wall
over<00:04:06.790> here<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.269> now<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:07.420> can<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.019> as

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
over here and now you can have this as

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.949 
over here and now you can have this as
tall<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:08.829> want<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:10.390> will<00:04:10.569> just<00:04:10.750> depend

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
tall as you want and it will just depend

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.949 
tall as you want and it will just depend
a<00:04:11.290> bit<00:04:11.470> if<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.400> have<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.700> very<00:04:12.970> high<00:04:13.359> it<00:04:13.690> can

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
a bit if you have it very high it can

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.890 
a bit if you have it very high it can
take<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.350> lot<00:04:14.769> longer<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.790> flow<00:04:16.299> down<00:04:16.600> and

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
take a lot longer to flow down and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.440 
take a lot longer to flow down and
everything<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.530> generate<00:04:18.100> okay<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:18.970> now

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
everything and generate okay so now

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.270 
everything and generate okay so now
we're<00:04:19.750> up<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.289> last<00:04:20.530> one<00:04:20.799> if<00:04:20.889> we<00:04:21.039> place<00:04:21.250> a

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
we're up to this last one if we place a

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.120 
we're up to this last one if we place a
bucket<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.789> water<00:04:22.110> you'll<00:04:23.110> see<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:23.620> most<00:04:23.919> of

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
bucket of water you'll see that most of

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.980 
bucket of water you'll see that most of
it<00:04:24.220> does<00:04:24.400> not<00:04:24.550> form<00:04:24.910> there's<00:04:25.300> like<00:04:25.479> one<00:04:25.750> block

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
it does not form there's like one block

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.580 
it does not form there's like one block
that<00:04:26.050> form<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.950> rest<00:04:27.159> did<00:04:27.430> not<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:28.590> that's

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
that form and the rest did not so that's

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.250 
that form and the rest did not so that's
pretty<00:04:29.830> much<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.550> how<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.210> form<00:04:31.780> these<00:04:31.930> now

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
pretty much it on how to form these now

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.540 
pretty much it on how to form these now
you<00:04:32.350> can<00:04:32.530> actually<00:04:32.680> get<00:04:32.920> rid<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.160> all<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
you can actually get rid of all the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
you can actually get rid of all the
water<00:04:33.820> up<00:04:34.060> here<00:04:35.400> like<00:04:36.400> Alma<00:04:36.970> if<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.330> build

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
water up here like Alma if you build

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.660 
water up here like Alma if you build
small<00:04:37.960> things<00:04:38.320> with<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.980> don't<00:04:39.370> recommend

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
small things with this I don't recommend

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.730 
small things with this I don't recommend
it<00:04:40.000> because<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:40.630> better<00:04:40.900> just<00:04:41.260> building<00:04:41.620> it

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
it because it's better just building it

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.410 
it because it's better just building it
with<00:04:41.920> your<00:04:42.100> hands<00:04:42.520> or<00:04:42.670> placing<00:04:43.120> blocks

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
with your hands or placing blocks

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.660 
with your hands or placing blocks
because<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.440> need<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.770> build<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.160> thing<00:04:45.220> up

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
because you need to build this thing up

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.490 
because you need to build this thing up
here<00:04:45.850> but<00:04:46.060> if<00:04:46.180> you're<00:04:46.330> like<00:04:46.480> building<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.990> giant

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
here but if you're like building a giant

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.340 
here but if you're like building a giant
wall<00:04:47.920> then<00:04:48.700> this<00:04:49.450> thing<00:04:49.720> would<00:04:49.960> save<00:04:50.200> you<00:04:50.320> a

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
wall then this thing would save you a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.980 
wall then this thing would save you a
lot<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.650> time<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.670> lot<00:04:51.850> of<00:04:51.910> resources<00:04:52.450> so<00:04:52.900> if

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
lot of time and a lot of resources so if

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.170 
lot of time and a lot of resources so if
I<00:04:53.110> get<00:04:53.170> rid<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.530> all<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.820> break<00:04:55.030> these

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
I get rid of all this I can break these

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.330 
I get rid of all this I can break these
blocks<00:04:55.540> around<00:04:56.020> here<00:04:56.260> now<00:04:56.440> I'm<00:04:56.770> just<00:04:57.010> get<00:04:57.220> rid

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
blocks around here now I'm just get rid

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.380 
blocks around here now I'm just get rid
of<00:04:57.430> all<00:04:57.610> these<00:04:59.490> as<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.760> see<00:05:00.970> we<00:05:01.180> have

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
last layer which you would have to

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.120 
last layer which you would have to
finish<00:05:06.430> or<00:05:07.090> add<00:05:07.420> another<00:05:08.140> water

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130
