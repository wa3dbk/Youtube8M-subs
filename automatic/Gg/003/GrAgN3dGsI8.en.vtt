script is going to contain six primary
things<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.150> my<00:00:09.269> estimation<00:00:10.160> the<00:00:11.160> first<00:00:11.460> thing

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
things in my estimation the first thing

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.660 
things in my estimation the first thing
that<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.389> compelling<00:00:12.719> script<00:00:13.139> will<00:00:13.349> contain<00:00:13.670> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that a compelling script will contain is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.040 
that a compelling script will contain is
a<00:00:14.910> well-formed<00:00:15.660> plot<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.379> plot<00:00:17.180> in<00:00:18.180> which<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
a well-formed plot a plot in which the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.290 
a well-formed plot a plot in which the
action<00:00:19.439> feeds<00:00:19.740> off<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.250> previous<00:00:20.550> action

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
action feeds off of the previous action

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.099

so you have a sort of actions in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.019 
so you have a sort of actions in
sequence<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.949> build<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.609> another<00:00:26.640> and
