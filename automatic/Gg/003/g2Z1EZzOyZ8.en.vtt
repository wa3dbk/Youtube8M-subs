00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.770
 very good to all kids that just like 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 you are welcome back to the channel and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.810
 we are here back in call of duty 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.790
 advanced warfare and first of all I tell you 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.550
 that you are going to listen to me a little differently 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.259
 since the sweet beats have been broken 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.210
 but surely this afternoon they are already 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.070
 arranged but just now 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.829
 I'm commenting with other helmets 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.169
 surely you are listening to me 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.359
 different but good I think that it 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.269
 listen more or less well so we're going to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.670
 them kids how to get the speak and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 if it's worth the speakeasy the asm one 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.310
 speakeasy without touching us in a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.860
 supply this is not going to put that monkey 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.280
 speakeasy we are not going to put some 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.740
 accessories so that the normal s1 is 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.900
 equivalent to the speakeasy so if 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.840
 you want to see how this trick is done 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.060
 good more than the trick this way to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.970
 have as a speakeasy for me not going 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.480
 I teach now thinks it later 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.930
 as you see here we have the ace-1 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 the asm 1 ok we do we put 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 vertical grip fire fast and you 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 we put scope when we have put 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.780
 these accessories will be like having a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 speakeasy if you do not look at the statistics and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.869
 you will see something else to save you a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.970
 space would be if you have the asm 1 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.490
 reckless that you put it and it's coming 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.509
 included the rapid fire with this we 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 we save a space but if we put the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.190
 same accessories, but if you do not have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 the rules then nothing happens you can 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.320
 put the other this amounts to a speed 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 and if it's worth it's a very easy trick that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.840
 I do not know I've seen that little has gone up 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.210
 people and the truth because it is a trick that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 The truth is that it serves a lot and is equivalent 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.340
 to a speakeasy that we won with this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.289
 Well, let's get the explanation 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.740
 in supply we can enjoy a 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.380
 weapon transited as that disadvantage that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.360
 It would not be like not wearing accessories but 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.930
 equally we all know that a spy 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 without accessories bursts likewise 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.470
 what good kids at the beginning of the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.840
 video over here I'm leaving you two 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.340
 notes in case you want to click on 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.680
 other tricks on how to get 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.660
 supplies and I remind you that you can 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.460
 subscribe to not miss any video 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 I also remind you that this channel 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.120
 it's not the audio quality that I use 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.380
 have in the channel because right now what 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.650
 I'm commenting with a microphone 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.360
 pretty bad so soon it is 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 I'll probably have the microphone later 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.920
 well and then we can return to the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.360
 normality in the channel as well as ones 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.040
 I hope you liked it already 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 you know you can share the video or if you 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.209
 He liked to give a like and a favorite that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.709
 help a lot and subscribe for not 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.900
 miss any video so good 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.070
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.430
 until next time 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.430
 chao chao
