the left the KBT 1.5 in chartreuse sexy

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.740 
the left the KBT 1.5 in chartreuse sexy
shad<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> right<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:46.290> KVD<00:00:46.710> 2.5<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
shad and on the right is the KVD 2.5 and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.970 
shad and on the right is the KVD 2.5 and
some<00:00:48.750> sort<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> blue<00:00:49.140> google<00:00:49.350> color<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.680> forgot

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
some sort of blue google color I forgot

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.340 
some sort of blue google color I forgot
but<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> obvious

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
but as you can see the obvious

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.670 
but as you can see the obvious
difference<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.760> 2.5<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.809> quite

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
difference is that the 2.5 is quite

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.279 
difference is that the 2.5 is quite
larger<00:00:56.010> than<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> 1.5<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:58.140> also

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
larger than the 1.5 and so they also

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.950 
larger than the 1.5 and so they also
have<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.559> size<00:00:58.920> 1.0<00:00:59.640> that's<00:01:00.120> even<00:01:00.390> smaller<00:01:00.660> than

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
have a size 1.0 that's even smaller than

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.939 
have a size 1.0 that's even smaller than
e<00:01:01.170> 1.5<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.470> questions<00:01:04.830> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
e 1.5 now I have some questions that

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
e 1.5 now I have some questions that
like<00:01:05.309> well<00:01:05.850> should<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> throw<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.450> 1.5<00:01:06.899> of<00:01:07.050> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
like well should I throw the 1.5 of the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.160 
like well should I throw the 1.5 of the
2.5<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.700> depends<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> situation<00:01:09.660> you're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
2.5 it depends on the situation you're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.900 
2.5 it depends on the situation you're
fishing<00:01:10.440> in<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.039> lot<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.430> times<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> water

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
fishing in and a lot of times the water

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.090 
fishing in and a lot of times the water
clarity<00:01:12.300> so<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.259> fishing<00:01:13.440> like<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.800> river

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
clarity so if I'm fishing like a river

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.669 
clarity so if I'm fishing like a river
system<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.759> a<00:01:14.910> system<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.470> dirty

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
system or a system that has a very dirty

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.680 
system or a system that has a very dirty
water<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.550> like<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.910> upper<00:01:18.149> end<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.479> lakes

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
water it's like the upper end of lakes

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.010 
water it's like the upper end of lakes
and<00:01:18.929> such<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.440> usually<00:01:20.310> fish<00:01:20.460> 22.5<00:01:21.149> because<00:01:21.690> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and such I usually fish 22.5 because it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
and such I usually fish 22.5 because it
creates<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.470> bigger<00:01:22.850> disturbance<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.940> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
creates a bigger disturbance in the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.900 
creates a bigger disturbance in the
water<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.390> fish<00:01:24.869> can't<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:26.429> size<00:01:26.610> or

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
water and fish can't see the size or

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.330 
water and fish can't see the size or
really<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.149> color<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.599> much<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.560> color

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
really the color as much and so color

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.339 
really the color as much and so color
doesn't<00:01:29.550> really<00:01:29.670> matter<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.240> dirty<00:01:30.840> water<00:01:30.929> as

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
doesn't really matter in dirty water as

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.710 
doesn't really matter in dirty water as
much<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> doesn't<00:01:32.130> clear<00:01:32.280> water<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.509> my

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
much as it doesn't clear water and so my

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.080 
much as it doesn't clear water and so my
home<00:01:33.869> link<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.140> Lake<00:01:34.289> Travis<00:01:34.819> crankbaits<00:01:35.819> are

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.210 
key because almost all the lake is rock
rock<00:01:39.239> structure<00:01:39.690> whether<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.679> be<00:01:40.739> rock<00:01:40.920> piles

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
rock structure whether it be rock piles

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.910 
rock structure whether it be rock piles
or<00:01:42.170> really<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> whole<00:01:43.500> thing<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.739> rock

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
and so I use the 1.5 a lot that's I use

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.380 
and so I use the 1.5 a lot that's I use
the<00:01:48.690> 1.5<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.560> start<00:01:50.099> off<00:01:50.220> tournaments<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the 1.5 to start off tournaments and to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.380 
the 1.5 to start off tournaments and to
to<00:01:51.660> get<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> quick<00:01:52.050> limit<00:01:52.440> because<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:54.030> really

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to get a quick limit because it really

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
to get a quick limit because it really
imitates<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.959> shad<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.709> lake<00:01:55.920> very<00:01:56.310> well

guess it's just universal that shad
looked<00:02:00.929> like<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.560> sexy<00:02:01.860> shad<00:02:02.039> color<00:02:02.250> and
