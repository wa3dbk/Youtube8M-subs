00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and been to all boys and well found in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.420
 this new video from your aretz 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.730
 the ice that brings you another struggle today 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.370
 the random battle jenny one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.349
 Well, the genie is finally back and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.790
 today we are with another youtuber that is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 rope that presents itself now 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.690
 hi all guys everywhere 9 am 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.119
 very ready for this wonderful challenge 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.410
 with incredible graphics if I like it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 so very much I am looking forward to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.050
 begin 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 it's really beautiful yet it wasn't there 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 used to an exhibition from today for the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.660
 first time and I must say that it always does the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.730
 his figure is this graphic then 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.410
 we can really start have not seen 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.690
 not even the film we hope we need 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 something interesting this game and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.020
 nothing anyway in the meantime that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 we await conrad's move and vi 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 I explain the graphics practically from the link 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.110
 below you can also access his 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 channel and at the end of the video you will find a link 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.399
 which also brings you its version of the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 fight in the meantime what a fear will do 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.109
 which at times dissolved well very well 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.059
 the knight because it was logical to launch kate 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.989
 mairati that a nation 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.530
 ok even from I can't even think a little 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.470
 place really does not freeze me then 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.540
 maybe by the way I don't know if you know 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.570
 here freezing is something 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.400
 bestial is a bad ugly thing 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 really practically not 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 mocking that there is practically the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 freezing goes on until death is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.470
 A thing like that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 everyone dreams of having many things have 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.049
 so many old things that they have 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.439
 improved or worsened depends on whether 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.290
 tend to show where you really 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.549
 here the magazine but really a lot 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.439
 meanwhile he still uses super fans 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.570
 crabs kate vera obviously not there 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.540
 manda ko vis that the move itself but 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 that and now there is a country that knows it is 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.909
 slower than me, however, could help me 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 lequan in which case put on the heel 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.210
 let's see where the point is not made 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.490
 resisted credible thanks to amnesia 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.310
 absolutely or here in this one 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:14.430
 generation I did I did 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 no criticism oh well no we were saying 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.590
 first influences derive from them the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:27.420
 right the usual infinite envelope no no 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.989
 absurd in the south from I could make you a 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.820
 absorption of mothers by the gods 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.340
 however yes the reporter bus eventually 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.050
 because in the end I'm quite slow 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:47.850
 good too much goodbye between recoil 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:50.730
 attacked for nothing consider of 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.700
 two points only faster than you 15 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.650
 let alone in yellow ok so can 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.319
 put back in song of my management 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.239
 the dodo ok that can shoot a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.260
 very heavy attack we see a little earlier 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.239
 to crack 96 by two opop really 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.950
 let's see a little fear if you came like that 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.870
 I'm afraid my mom with you 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.840
 would never wait for this move not yes 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.480
 never sees on a duo huber earthquake is 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.940
 straggler no no 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.640
 but that the law is extremely useless yes 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.200
 stop we don't study anymore I thought 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.720
 did more with an escaped move 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.790
 with 120 of power and instead no but no 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.920
 perhaps after law here it was more scarce than 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.220
 now maybe with all that strength though 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.269
 now that is good at home but that is 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.519
 driving the strong song then 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.379
 we can use this move a classic 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.810
 we see a little this kind of type 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.799
 psycho on maybe yes absolutely 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.599
 especially in the first generation 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.269
 proposed in creativity there are 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.720
 andresen grandpa never did but mister 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.030
 it's right 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.890
 I thought you were doing a lot more than I thought 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.790
 from the mission because the house but one 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.760
 ridiculous defense 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.650
 mamma mia what a crap defense oh well it 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.910
 I take this opportunity to have it removed later 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.519
 unfortunately, still attacking 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.079
 attacked at least 18 months ago 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.239
 very well, he left me 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.160
 now remember the gazelle somewhat 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.260
 arouse in the way of enemy moves that 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.760
 has very few ps we see a bit like the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.049
 next moment that is but I don't know 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.849
 really if not one worse than the other 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:28.400
 the ninja boss is serious ok 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:30.080
 attack and a serious person to proceed 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.430
 because an attack probably the law 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.789
 can only ass 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:40.900
 criticized for once it served today 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.879
 attention to bears that creates 96 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.069
 well i think i'm faster i don't know me 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.479
 gives a lot of speed 231 bases 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.699
 to me however in I know how he holds heathrow 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.650
 inclined to now is not his day 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.610
 could have said maybe in the other time by 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.039
 I had said resell it 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.990
 well now you don't want to create 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.669
 from the hooks to sweep from 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.479
 uproar after the dips themselves are not 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.639
 finished we were starting ok okay test 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.550
 girl be the uproar but always holding 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.340
 the blow and then to the gazzam ends 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.279
 here sweep well then control against 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.180
 amazon offers a little as I was in surplus 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:24.810
 good we put him but we put ourselves 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.520
 let's hope I don't really feel here 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.470
 we mean to infinity we see a little bit 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.890
 archaic 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:40.650
 no to emerge dg rai giu damn it is 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:43.420
 true a little more for the long ok 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.250
 then we are so watched asleep 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.710
 enough on no 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:52.570
 I think I understand so perfect and I finish 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.270
 so uncritically enough forward not 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.830
 Christmas is nothing seize condor 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.960
 obviously could not miss the most in 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.000
 end well then thank you 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.240
