00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
sure that you give it a little tap by

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.060 
sure that you give it a little tap by
the<00:07:06.070> ear

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.590 

the<00:07:12.490> reason<00:07:12.760> why<00:07:12.850> you<00:07:12.910> give<00:07:13.090> it<00:07:13.180> a<00:07:13.210> little<00:07:13.330> tap

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.600 
the reason why you give it a little tap

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.090 
the reason why you give it a little tap
by<00:07:13.810> the<00:07:13.870> air<00:07:14.110> so<00:07:14.500> you<00:07:14.560> don't<00:07:14.710> get<00:07:14.800> that<00:07:14.920> little

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
by the air so you don't get that little

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:23.220 
by the air so you don't get that little
hole<00:07:15.430> there<00:07:20.100> and<00:07:21.100> just<00:07:21.600> take<00:07:22.600> your<00:07:22.840> time<00:07:23.050> with

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.230 
hole there and just take your time with

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:30.420 
hole there and just take your time with
it<00:07:23.440> and<00:07:23.800> clean<00:07:24.430> it<00:07:24.550> up<00:07:24.670> slow<00:07:29.070> I'll<00:07:30.070> stand<00:07:30.340> in

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430 
it and clean it up slow I'll stand in

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.920 
it and clean it up slow I'll stand in
front<00:07:30.550> of<00:07:30.700> the<00:07:30.790> person<00:07:31.000> and<00:07:31.510> I'll<00:07:31.690> actually

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
front of the person and I'll actually

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.290 
front of the person and I'll actually
pull<00:07:32.860> it<00:07:32.980> down<00:07:33.130> and<00:07:33.250> make<00:07:33.370> sure<00:07:33.550> it's<00:07:33.700> even<00:07:34.000> now

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
pull it down and make sure it's even now

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.790 
pull it down and make sure it's even now
I<00:07:34.330> can<00:07:34.630> see<00:07:34.810> that<00:07:34.960> this<00:07:35.140> sides<00:07:35.380> a<00:07:35.530> little<00:07:35.650> bit

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
I can see that this sides a little bit

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.980 
I can see that this sides a little bit
longer<00:07:36.100> so<00:07:37.000> I'll<00:07:37.120> cut<00:07:37.360> that<00:07:37.540> a<00:07:37.600> little<00:07:37.870> bit

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
longer so I'll cut that a little bit

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:51.330 
longer so I'll cut that a little bit
more<00:07:38.170> just<00:07:38.530> to<00:07:38.620> even<00:07:38.770> it<00:07:38.920> off
