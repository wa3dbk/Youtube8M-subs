later videos on how this dlc is going to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
later videos on how this dlc is going to
drop<00:00:35.670> now<00:00:36.239> apparently<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:36.960> supposed<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
drop now apparently it was supposed to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.840 
drop now apparently it was supposed to
drop<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.649> march<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.399> pushed<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> back

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
drop in march then they pushed it back

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.040 
drop in march then they pushed it back
because<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.329> leak<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> wasn't<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
because of a leak but that wasn't the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
because of a leak but that wasn't the
only<00:00:40.110> reason<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.710> said<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
only reason they said that they want to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
only reason they said that they want to
fix<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.300> patch<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> work

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
fix it and patch it up to make it work

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
fix it and patch it up to make it work
it's<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> dark<00:00:44.730> below<00:00:44.879> where<00:00:45.239> it's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it's not like the dark below where it's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
it's not like the dark below where it's
lacking<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.559> stuff<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.430> so

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
lacking a lot of stuff that they need so

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.680 
lacking a lot of stuff that they need so
that's<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> reason<00:00:48.090> why<00:00:48.300> they're<00:00:48.510> apparently

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that's the reason why they're apparently

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.439 
that's the reason why they're apparently
pushed<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.680> maze<00:00:50.070> what<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> release

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

pushed it back to maze what the release
date<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.690> apparently<00:00:52.649> scheduled<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.579> now

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

about<00:01:28.380> flat<00:01:28.740> every<00:01:29.070> year<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.369> year<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
about flat every year this year and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.399 
about flat every year this year and
going<00:01:30.000> forward<00:01:30.270> every<00:01:30.570> year<00:01:30.720> until<00:01:30.780> destitute

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
going forward every year until destitute

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.840 
going forward every year until destitute
comes<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.790> than

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
comes out it's going to be more than

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
comes out it's going to be more than
just<00:01:33.000> map<00:01:33.420> packs<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.930> leveling<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
just map packs and leveling up this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
just map packs and leveling up this
major<00:01:34.890> content<00:01:35.369> drop<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> more

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
major content drop is going to be more

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
major content drop is going to be more
like<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.570> world<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> warcraft<00:01:36.990> expansion<00:01:37.409> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like a world of warcraft expansion so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
like a world of warcraft expansion so
probably<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> forty<00:01:39.090> dollar<00:01:39.119> 10

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
probably more like a forty dollar 10

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.940 
probably more like a forty dollar 10
level<00:01:39.840> cap<00:01:39.990> change<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.470> opposed<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
level cap change as opposed to a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
level cap change as opposed to a
twenty-dollar<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> level<00:01:41.909> cap<00:01:42.090> change<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
twenty-dollar to level cap change so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.910 
twenty-dollar to level cap change so
that's<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.259> bit<00:01:43.380> more<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's a little bit more about the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.289 
that's a little bit more about the
account<00:01:44.189> you'll<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.000> heard

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
about that it's supposed to come out

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.980 
about that it's supposed to come out
later<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> year<00:01:47.250> more<00:01:48.210> around<00:01:48.420> fall<00:01:48.720> time

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
later in the year more around fall time

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
later in the year more around fall time
is<00:01:49.170> parently<00:01:49.590> rumored<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.430> there's<00:01:50.640> also

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a little bit more talk about the house

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
a little bit more talk about the house
of<00:01:52.290> wolves<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.680> other<00:01:52.920> stuff<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.369> here

of wolves and other stuff right here

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.429 
of wolves and other stuff right here
says<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.329> unsure<00:01:54.689> about<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.990> frequency

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
says they are unsure about the frequency

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.719 
says they are unsure about the frequency
of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> twenty-dollar<00:01:56.009> expansions<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of the twenty-dollar expansions but that

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550 
of the twenty-dollar expansions but that
there<00:01:56.909> may<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.570> least<00:01:57.750> four<00:01:58.110> month<00:01:58.380> gap

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
there may be at least four month gap

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.050 
there may be at least four month gap
between<00:01:58.799> each<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.939> how

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
between each one I don't know how

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.039 
between each one I don't know how
frequently<00:02:00.450> we're<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
frequently we're going to see the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.300 
frequently we're going to see the
twenty-dollar<00:02:01.409> versions<00:02:01.770> about<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.009> guess<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
twenty-dollar versions about my guess is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
twenty-dollar versions about my guess is
that<00:02:02.340> you'll<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.759> 220<00:02:03.450> our<00:02:03.540> expansions<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that you'll see 220 our expansions and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
that you'll see 220 our expansions and
140<00:02:04.619> dollar<00:02:04.770> expansion<00:02:04.979> each<00:02:05.369> year<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.060> kind

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
140 dollar expansion each year so kind

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.089 
140 dollar expansion each year so kind
of<00:02:06.450> pace<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.079> way<00:02:07.110> every<00:02:07.920> four

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
of pace it out that way every four

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.410 
of pace it out that way every four
months<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.489> something<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.390> i

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
months you get something like that so i

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.540 
months you get something like that so i
think<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> goal<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.289> keep<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.649> 3.5

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
think that the goal is to keep that 3.5

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
think that the goal is to keep that 3.5
to<00:02:11.730> 5.5<00:02:12.450> million<00:02:12.750> day

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to 5.5 million day

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.870 
to 5.5 million day
the<00:02:13.110> active<00:02:13.470> player<00:02:13.620> groups<00:02:13.890> spending<00:02:14.460> sixty

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the active player groups spending sixty

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.300 
the active player groups spending sixty
to<00:02:14.970> eighty<00:02:15.120> dollars<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.570> year<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:17.040> he<00:02:17.160> just

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to eighty dollars a year so like he just

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.520 
to eighty dollars a year so like he just
said<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.550> content<00:02:18.300> drops<00:02:18.480> having<00:02:18.720> me<00:02:18.780> 2<00:02:19.110> $20

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
said to content drops having me 2 $20

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590 
said to content drops having me 2 $20
content<00:02:19.950> drops<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.370> 140<00:02:20.850> our<00:02:20.970> content<00:02:21.360> drop<00:02:21.570> a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
content drops in 140 our content drop a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.210 
content drops in 140 our content drop a
gear<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.020> that's<00:02:22.170> three<00:02:22.410> content<00:02:22.830> drops<00:02:23.040> all

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
gear so that's three content drops all

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
gear so that's three content drops all
together<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> argument<00:02:24.270> most<00:02:25.200> likely<00:02:25.530> in

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
together so the argument most likely in

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.900 
together so the argument most likely in
between<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.190> months<00:02:26.460> because<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.760> only

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
between for months because that only

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.060 
between for months because that only
makes<00:02:27.150> sense<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:28.560> they<00:02:28.680> separate<00:02:28.980> their

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
makes sense and like they separate their

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.610 
makes sense and like they separate their
3.5<00:02:29.700> 5.5<00:02:30.420> million<00:02:30.750> daily<00:02:30.990> active<00:02:31.170> players

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
3.5 5.5 million daily active players

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.710 
3.5 5.5 million daily active players
that<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.220> how<00:02:32.370> many<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.150> said<00:02:33.360> daily

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that is how many like I just said daily

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.020 
that is how many like I just said daily
active<00:02:33.960> players<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.350> destiny<00:02:34.710> has<00:02:35.030> right

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
active players that destiny has right

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.390
