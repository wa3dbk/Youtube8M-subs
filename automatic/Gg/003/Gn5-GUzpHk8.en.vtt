don't<00:00:53.370> mean<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.670> were<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.000> clapping<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
don't mean they were just clapping on

don't mean they were just clapping on
the<00:00:54.660> 1<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.079> 3<00:00:55.289> beats<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.100> old

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190

they<00:01:01.920> would<00:01:02.070> try<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.570> off<00:01:03.750> the
