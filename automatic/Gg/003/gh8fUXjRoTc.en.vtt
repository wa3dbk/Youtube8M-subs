00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that and turn it on they don't really

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
that and turn it on they don't really
put<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.570> much<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.020> puts<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> error

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
put out that much this puts out a error

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.590 
put out that much this puts out a error
I'm<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> demonstrate<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> second

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
I'm going to demonstrate for a second

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
I'm going to demonstrate for a second
that's<00:00:54.600> power<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:56.210> that's<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> see

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that's power one that's off you can see

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.229 
that's power one that's off you can see
that<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> good<00:01:00.920> quality<00:01:01.969> motor<00:01:02.969> in

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that they use a good quality motor in

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
that they use a good quality motor in
there<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.870> bearings<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.350> stuff

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there with good bearings and stuff

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
there with good bearings and stuff
because<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.769> fans<00:01:05.129> still<00:01:05.460> spin<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
because that fans still spin it and it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.980 
because that fans still spin it and it's
off<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> also<00:01:09.689> means

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
off so you know that and that also means

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
off so you know that and that also means
you're<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.979> spending<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.369> lot<00:01:11.549> on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you're going to not be spending a lot on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.050 
you're going to not be spending a lot on
electricity<00:01:13.189> for<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.280> batteries<00:01:14.670> sake<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
electricity for your batteries sake that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.310 
electricity for your batteries sake that
is<00:01:16.159> because<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.520> requiring<00:01:17.970> very<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
is because it's requiring very little to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
is because it's requiring very little to
run<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> there's<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> drag<00:01:20.670> it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
run it there's not a lot of drag it's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140 
run it there's not a lot of drag it's
not<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:22.400> bad<00:01:23.400> bearings<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
not like it's bad bearings you have to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
not like it's bad bearings you have to
overcome<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.570> by<00:01:24.840> putting<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
overcome that by putting on more and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
overcome that by putting on more and
more<00:01:25.650> electricity<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> show

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
more electricity so I'm going to show

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.300 
more electricity so I'm going to show
you<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:28.320> two<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.650> three

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.250 

and<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> significant<00:01:36.450> amount<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> hair

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:50.850 

listen<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:45.370> that's<00:01:46.370> quite<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> report

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.060 

fantasize<00:01:53.020> or<00:01:54.020> anything<00:01:54.850> fantasize<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.150> is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
fantasize or anything fantasize that is

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.880 
fantasize or anything fantasize that is
that's<00:01:58.070> why<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:58.460> age<00:01:58.610> $5<00:01:59.360> if<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.500> find<00:02:00.770> it

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
that's why it's age $5 if you find it

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.790 
that's why it's age $5 if you find it
cheaper<00:02:01.250> feel<00:02:01.910> lucky<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.970> is<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.120> good<00:02:05.360> device

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
cheaper feel lucky it is a good device

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.990 
cheaper feel lucky it is a good device
I'm<00:02:06.800> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:07.010> use<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.490> boat<00:02:07.670> because

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
I'm going to use it on the boat because

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.500 
I'm going to use it on the boat because
I'm<00:02:08.060> outside<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.630> boat<00:02:08.810> all<00:02:08.930> day<00:02:09.140> long<00:02:09.380> and
