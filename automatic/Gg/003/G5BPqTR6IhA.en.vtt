00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.549
 This time 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 We received cooperation to 32 who had want Co., Ltd. and 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:17.070
 Sold by Mr. Yata 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 There is a product called 8 hot alarm 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.180
 That 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.180
 I would like to introduce the process of modeling 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.780
 A product called this feverish alarm is good 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:44.379
 From temperature and humidity king 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:50.140
 How dangerous is the heat stroke to your current location? 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:53.629
 It will be an alarm to measure and warn 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.570
 Specifically, 8 Mr. Yata's website 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.570
 It is nice and you can check the details 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 The modeling process is also described here, but first 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 As I was able to borrow an actual item from Mr. Yata this time 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.170
 Close to orthographic 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.950
 Front and again 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:29.650
 back 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.530
 Take a picture of each side there and import it into each view 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.460
 Modeling 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 When making a big deal 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 I think that trying to use as a per 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:51.950
 Without built Aikinari in modeling the early stages of 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:54.420
 Place the shape of primitive U ãƒ¼ such as TOKYU TIRE 40 and balance the whole 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.570
 confirm 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.770
 Then we will make each part 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.190
 This time, without using the subdivision surface 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.190
 mainly 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.550
 beneath take a modeling method using a boolean 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 The final part of the whole process is finished 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.950
 In fine operation 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.950
 Make a small bevel or a finish 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:38.569
 Then edit uv 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:44.220
 Because the also creates this time the the material uses the renderer dull example 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:50.600
 Materials will also be made for v 0 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.600
 This time for no ping hdr light studio 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.010
 I will try to use 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:03.260
 Create an hdr image created with this software 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.260
 Try to Tehe rendering and lighting 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.750
 Here is the rendering Oh a 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.890
 Adjusted by photoshop and completed 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.980
 It becomes a still picture 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.599
 8 well 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.450
 Or try to one Atochotto diagonally from right in front 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.000
 I can see the back of the weight 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 From the angle 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.880
 I tried to make 3 cuts 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:47.720
 Here's the modeling is complete and the material settings are complete. 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.720
 8 As it is still this way, the shape is a bit confusing 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.110
 With the texture off 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.960
 I will try to display 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:04.880
 It is a model of this kind of feeling 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:10.420
 I mentioned a little bit earlier but almost this time 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.420
 Do not use 90% of the subdivision surface 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.090
 It is a model using boolean 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.940
 It is such a feeling when it expands 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.220
 Here 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:33.430
 All these places are being chosen 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.730
 A hole in the hermitage Broiled from the original object 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.980
 After determining the shape 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.020
 point 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:46.830
 Organize 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.830
 It has become the applicants appointed model of the form 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.570
 81 places here 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.400
 To The individual parts 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:05.810
 Oh yeah 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.810
 Because the shape was like is relatively high undulating 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.099
 I used a subdivision surface here 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.450
 If you look at 8 object manager 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.450
 Paint first say that this alarm 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.139
 Under the condition that it is in the root child 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.600
 is not it 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.240
 To the child of 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.240
 8 for each part 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.670
 It is in the state that contains each part 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.160
 Then from next time 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:58.120
 Along this process 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.120
 I would like to explain in order
