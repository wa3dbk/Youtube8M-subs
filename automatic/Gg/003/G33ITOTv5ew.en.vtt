while a bit more complex still can
basically<00:00:57.239> come<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.780> those<00:00:57.930> basic

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
basically come down to those basic

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
basically come down to those basic
shapes<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.340> when<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.850> pose

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
shapes but then when we have the pose

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
shapes but then when we have the pose
and<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> basic<00:01:00.899> shapes<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.320> place<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:02.039> can

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and the basic shapes in place we can

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
and the basic shapes in place we can
start<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.670> add<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.850> refinement<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
start to add the refinement and the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
start to add the refinement and the
details<00:01:04.290> things<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> clothing<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.549> the

my pencil lines almost to the point

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.890 
my pencil lines almost to the point
where<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.130> look<00:01:14.340> quite<00:01:14.670> solid<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> when

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
where they look quite solid so that when

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
I get to the line work I can simply just

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
I get to the line work I can simply just
draw<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:18.630> erase<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> line

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
draw over it and then erase the line

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.030 
draw over it and then erase the line
work<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.680> underneath

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
ready to move on to my line work I'm

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
ready to move on to my line work I'm
just<00:01:23.790> using<00:01:23.970> basic<00:01:24.479> unit<00:01:24.990> pen<00:01:25.140> fineliners<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
just using basic unit pen fineliners and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
just using basic unit pen fineliners and
I'm<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> go<00:01:26.250> over<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> whole<00:01:26.729> thing<00:01:26.790> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I'm going to go over the whole thing in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
I'm going to go over the whole thing in
a<00:01:27.270> point<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.920> quite

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
a point one so it's going to be quite

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.710 
a point one so it's going to be quite
fine<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.030> basically<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
fine and that's basically because I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
fine and that's basically because I
really<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> details

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
really want to get the details

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.520 
really want to get the details
especially<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.310> hero's<00:01:33.030> face<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> then

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
especially in hero's face right and then

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.080 
especially in hero's face right and then
I'll<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.770> ready<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> erase<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.579> construction

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I'll be ready to erase the construction

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.539 
I'll be ready to erase the construction
work<00:01:36.240> from<00:01:36.479> underneath<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
work from underneath and get on to the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
work from underneath and get on to the
color<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.090> doing<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> line<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.140> trying

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
color in doing the line work I'm trying

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
color in doing the line work I'm trying
to<00:01:40.439> keep<00:01:40.619> things<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.100> crisp<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.670> possible

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to keep things as crisp as possible

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.940 
to keep things as crisp as possible
I<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:42.930> characters<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.590> shapes<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I want these characters and shapes to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
I want these characters and shapes to
look<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.460> solid<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.090> clean<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
look really solid and clean so I'm just

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710 
look really solid and clean so I'm just
using<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.829> simplistic<00:01:47.549> lines<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.420> going

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
using very simplistic lines not going

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.090 
using very simplistic lines not going
over<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> top<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> detail<00:01:49.649> or<00:01:49.799> using

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
over the top of the detail or using

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
over the top of the detail or using
techniques<00:01:50.430> such<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.939> cross<00:01:51.329> hatching<00:01:51.720> or

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
techniques such as cross hatching or

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.120 
techniques such as cross hatching or
anything<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.770> keeping

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
anything like that just keeping

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 
anything like that just keeping
everything<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.640> clean<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.240> solid<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> can

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
everything as clean and solid as I can

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
everything as clean and solid as I can
now<00:01:55.920> baymax<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> very<00:01:57.060> simplistic

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
now baymax is a very simplistic

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.770 
now baymax is a very simplistic
character<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:59.009> white<00:01:59.369> coloring<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
character with white coloring so that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.179 
character with white coloring so that
means<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> lines<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.710> him<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
means the lines on him are going to

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.069 
means the lines on him are going to
stand<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.820> heck<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.840> I'm<00:02:03.930> going

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
stand out a heck of a lot so I'm going

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.810 
stand out a heck of a lot so I'm going
to<00:02:04.140> focus<00:02:04.320> really<00:02:04.950> hard<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.430> make<00:02:05.610> sure<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to focus really hard to make sure that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.419 
to focus really hard to make sure that
the<00:02:06.329> lines<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.810> draw<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.350> him<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:08.069> smooth

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the lines I draw for him are as smooth

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.889 
the lines I draw for him are as smooth
as<00:02:08.610> possible<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> shapes<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
as possible and that the shapes that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.300 
as possible and that the shapes that
make<00:02:10.500> him<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.849> clean<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.239> solid

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
make him up are really clean and solid

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.890 
make him up are really clean and solid
when<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.430> erase<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.940> lines<00:02:14.120> sometimes<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.750> like

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
when I erase the lines sometimes I like

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.229 
when I erase the lines sometimes I like
to<00:02:15.020> use<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> needle<00:02:15.650> eraser<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.700> has<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> bit<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.150> a

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
to use a needle eraser it has a bit of a

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.180 
to use a needle eraser it has a bit of a
gum<00:02:17.480> consistency<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.410> allows<00:02:18.650> me<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> remove

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
gum consistency and allows me to remove

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.190 
gum consistency and allows me to remove
all<00:02:19.459> my<00:02:19.610> construction<00:02:20.330> work<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.720> pencil

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
all my construction work in pencil

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.110 
all my construction work in pencil
without<00:02:21.650> having<00:02:22.190> all<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> little<00:02:23.000> bits

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
without having all of the little bits

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.240 
without having all of the little bits
that<00:02:23.420> come<00:02:23.720> off<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.110> normal<00:02:24.470> eraser<00:02:24.709> spread

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
that come off of a normal eraser spread

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.460 
that come off of a normal eraser spread
all<00:02:25.370> over<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> table<00:02:25.880> after<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.390> do<00:02:26.480> my<00:02:26.599> erasing

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
all over the table after I do my erasing

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.900 
all over the table after I do my erasing
so<00:02:27.709> now<00:02:27.830> I've<00:02:27.950> got<00:02:28.099> my<00:02:28.130> line<00:02:28.459> work<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.790> I'm

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so now I've got my line work and I'm

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.460 
so now I've got my line work and I'm
happy<00:02:29.270> with<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.690> construction<00:02:29.959> works

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
happy with it the construction works

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.350 
happy with it the construction works
gone<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.370> interesting<00:02:31.819> thing<00:02:31.970> about<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
gone the interesting thing about this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.570 
gone the interesting thing about this
stage<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.959> if<00:02:33.290> things<00:02:33.769> start<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.130> look<00:02:34.220> more

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
stage is if things start to look more

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.339 
stage is if things start to look more
refined<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.269> obviously<00:02:35.540> looks<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.900> lot<00:02:36.050> crisper

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
refined it obviously looks a lot crisper

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.660 
refined it obviously looks a lot crisper
than<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.769> did<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.130> was<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.550> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
than it did when it was just the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.460 
than it did when it was just the
construction<00:02:37.940> work<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.780> find<00:02:39.019> you<00:02:39.080> also

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
construction work but I find you also

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.470 
construction work but I find you also
lose<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> bit<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.099> dimension<00:02:40.400> when<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.180> get<00:02:41.330> rid

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
lose a bit of dimension when you get rid

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.940 
lose a bit of dimension when you get rid
of<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.630> construction<00:02:42.200> work<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.650> think<00:02:42.860> it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
of the construction work and I think it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.710 
of the construction work and I think it
it<00:02:43.310> seems<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.790> add<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.940> bit<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.180> shadow<00:02:44.510> around

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
it seems to add a bit of shadow around

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.720 
it seems to add a bit of shadow around
the<00:02:44.989> edges<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.410> make<00:02:45.560> things<00:02:45.799> feel<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.489> little

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
the edges and make things feel a little

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.100 
the edges and make things feel a little
more<00:02:46.910> full-bodied<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:47.989> you're

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
more full-bodied and then when you're

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.199 
more full-bodied and then when you're
left<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.010> line<00:02:49.430> work<00:02:49.670> though<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
left with just the line work though it

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.910 
left with just the line work though it
can<00:02:50.450> look<00:02:50.660> more<00:02:50.870> refined<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.350> nice<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.799> can

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
can look more refined and nice it can

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.130 
can look more refined and nice it can
also<00:02:52.100> feel<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:53.180> flatter<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:53.989> that's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
also feel a little flatter but that's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.630 
also feel a little flatter but that's
okay<00:02:54.500> because<00:02:54.620> we're<00:02:54.860> going<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> rescue<00:02:55.340> it

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
okay because we're going to rescue it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.130 
okay because we're going to rescue it
with<00:02:55.790> color<00:02:56.120> which<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.690> really<00:02:56.900> make

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
with color which is going to really make

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.229 
with color which is going to really make
it<00:02:57.170> pop<00:02:57.319> out<00:02:57.650> all<00:02:57.890> over<00:02:57.920> again<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.670> for<00:02:59.060> that

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
it pop out all over again and for that

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.210 
it pop out all over again and for that
I'm<00:02:59.450> going<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.870> be<00:02:59.959> using<00:03:00.110> Copic<00:03:00.560> markers

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
I'm going to be using Copic markers

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.979

a base of e 40 brick white and I use the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.569 
a base of e 40 brick white and I use the
zero<00:03:53.720> colorless<00:03:54.410> blender<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:55.069> blend<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.370> in

a portion of baymax's skin but I quickly

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.140 
a portion of baymax's skin but I quickly
repaired<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:06.620> by<00:04:06.829> softening<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.730> very

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150

to<00:04:49.470> use<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:49.980> because<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.430> alcohol-based

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
to use it but because it's alcohol-based

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.470

and you're using alcohol-based markers
basically<00:04:54.480> you<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.930> use<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.470> soften<00:04:55.770> the

basically you can use it to soften the
colors<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.550> help<00:04:56.760> blend<00:04:57.300> things<00:04:57.720> together

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960
