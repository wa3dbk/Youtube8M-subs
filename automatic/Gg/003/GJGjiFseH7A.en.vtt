00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and if you have all the sets you can

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.520 
and if you have all the sets you can
create<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> MS<00:00:41.790> cage<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.140> bits<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
create the MS cage we get bits and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.650 
create the MS cage we get bits and
pieces<00:00:43.739> from<00:00:44.010> each<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
pieces from each one of them and you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
pieces from each one of them and you
have<00:00:45.750> instructions<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> build<00:00:47.190> em

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
have instructions on how to build em

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.750 
have instructions on how to build em
escape<00:00:47.760> inside<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.160> pretty<00:00:50.399> much<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
escape inside and that's pretty much it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.979 
escape inside and that's pretty much it
for<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> bus<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.510> let's<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.809> take<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
for the bus and then let's go take a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.680 
for the bus and then let's go take a
look<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> figure<00:00:52.940> all<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.480> have

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
look at the figure all right we have

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
look at the figure all right we have
seen<00:00:54.930> Anjou<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.980> always<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.579> hard<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
seen Anjou it's always kind of hard to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.819 
seen Anjou it's always kind of hard to
record<00:00:57.899> something<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.410> too<00:00:59.070> bright<00:00:59.609> red<00:01:00.829> but

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
record something with too bright red but

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
record something with too bright red but
yeah<00:01:02.070> again<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.030> didn't<00:01:03.359> power<00:01:03.510> line<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.989> just

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
yeah again I didn't power line this just

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
yeah again I didn't power line this just
right<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> box<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.330> it'll<00:01:06.689> look

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
right out of the box I think it'll look

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
right out of the box I think it'll look
even<00:01:07.140> better<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:08.310> what's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:08.939> bit

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
even better if what's a little bit

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.440 
even better if what's a little bit

non-jew again you have the peg system

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.950 
non-jew again you have the peg system
which<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.970> connect<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> left<00:01:51.720> or

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
which you can connect on the left or

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.249 
which you can connect on the left or
right<00:01:52.970> yep<00:01:54.920> same<00:01:55.920> thing<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.280> our<00:01:56.310> rifle<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
right yep same thing with our rifle you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.880 
right yep same thing with our rifle you
can<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> other<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.549> also<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.890> this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
can do so on the other and also and this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
can do so on the other and also and this
one<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.219> slightly<00:02:02.310> different<00:02:02.790> than<00:02:03.180> your

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
one is slightly different than your

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.370 
one is slightly different than your
other<00:02:03.420> ones<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.259> think

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
other ones I think

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.869 
other ones I think
recall<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.469> they<00:02:07.619> hand<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.039> plate<00:02:08.340> it's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
recall that they hand a plate it's

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.050 
recall that they hand a plate it's
slightly<00:02:09.330> slanted<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:11.280> again<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
slightly slanted but again you can

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.040 
slightly slanted but again you can
combine<00:02:12.239> use<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
combine use this on the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.810 
combine use this on the
left<00:02:14.770> hand<00:02:15.420> all<00:02:16.420> right<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:18.220> know<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.640> one

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
left hand all right you know this one

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.480 
left hand all right you know this one
has<00:02:18.940> really<00:02:19.320> nice<00:02:20.320> articulation<00:02:20.740> there<00:02:21.370> on

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
has really nice articulation there on

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.170 
has really nice articulation there on
the<00:02:21.580> shoulder

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the shoulder

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.890 
the shoulder
let's<00:02:22.900> take<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> closer<00:02:23.440> look<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.600> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
let's take a closer look right so I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.660 
let's take a closer look right so I
start<00:02:26.890> with<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.070> head<00:02:27.250> first

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
start with a head first

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.180 
start with a head first
they're<00:02:28.060> pretty<00:02:28.420> good<00:02:28.600> they're<00:02:28.660> high

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
they're pretty good they're high

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.620 
they're pretty good they're high
articulation<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.520> don't<00:02:30.910> really<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.360> an<00:02:31.480> eye

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
articulation I don't really see an eye

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.100 
articulation I don't really see an eye
there<00:02:31.960> if<00:02:32.620> there's<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.950> speck<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.600> pink<00:02:34.600> or

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
there if there's a speck of pink or

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.230 
there if there's a speck of pink or
something<00:02:35.520> then<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.550> have<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.880> shoulder

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
something then you have the shoulder

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.720 
something then you have the shoulder
armor<00:02:37.660> then<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.740> part<00:02:39.010> here<00:02:39.100> moves<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.550> and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
armor then this part here moves up and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.630 
armor then this part here moves up and
down<00:02:39.870> whatnot<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:43.060> arm<00:02:43.530> bends<00:02:44.640> 90

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
down whatnot and the arm bends 90

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.900 
down whatnot and the arm bends 90
degrees<00:02:47.100> waist<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:50.350> up<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.640> actually

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
degrees waist like up and actually

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.890 
degrees waist like up and actually
there's<00:02:52.210> a<00:02:52.300> swivel<00:02:52.710> really<00:02:53.710> nice<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:55.630> doesn't

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
there's a swivel really nice it doesn't

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.770 
there's a swivel really nice it doesn't
have<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.140> snow<00:02:56.290> cone<00:02:56.320> on<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.590> other<00:02:56.770> ones<00:02:57.780> have

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
have a snow cone on the other ones have

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.060 
have a snow cone on the other ones have
yet<00:02:58.960> but<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.260> yep<00:02:59.590> they<00:02:59.800> do<00:02:59.950> similar<00:03:00.640> part<00:03:02.070> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
yet but the yep they do similar part and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.910 
yet but the yep they do similar part and
you<00:03:03.940> have<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.270> part<00:03:04.570> here<00:03:04.810> doesn't<00:03:05.740> have<00:03:05.830> a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
you have this part here doesn't have a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.220 
you have this part here doesn't have a
shin<00:03:06.310> guard<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:10.210> yeah<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.020> that's

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
shin guard and yeah I think that's

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.720 
shin guard and yeah I think that's
pretty<00:03:11.380> much<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.560> for<00:03:11.680> articulation<00:03:12.370> then<00:03:12.640> you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
pretty much it for articulation then you

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.330 
pretty much it for articulation then you
have<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.970> backpack<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.920> backpack

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
have the backpack here the backpack

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.330 
have the backpack here the backpack
actually<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:16.170> move<00:03:17.170> outward<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.830> little<00:03:18.130> bit

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
actually can move outward a little bit

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.090 
actually can move outward a little bit
it's<00:03:19.020> kind<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.290> weird<00:03:20.410> double<00:03:20.860> peg

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
it's kind of in a weird double peg

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.010 
it's kind of in a weird double peg
system<00:03:21.850> or<00:03:22.090> hatching<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.510> straight<00:03:22.780> back<00:03:22.990> with

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
system or hatching a straight back with

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.500 
system or hatching a straight back with
a<00:03:23.230> ball<00:03:23.470> joint<00:03:23.800> but<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.190> gonna<00:03:25.180> oh<00:03:27.510> it's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
a ball joint but it's gonna oh it's

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.060 
a ball joint but it's gonna oh it's
always<00:03:28.630> being<00:03:29.050> just<00:03:29.260> just<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.560> straight

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
always being just just like straight

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.940 
always being just just like straight
then<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.300> have<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> propeller<00:03:31.900> tanks<00:03:32.560> its

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
then you have the propeller tanks its

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.820 
then you have the propeller tanks its
movable<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.120> there's<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.570> big<00:03:34.870> chunk<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.530> link

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
movable and there's a big chunk of link

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.320 
movable and there's a big chunk of link
there<00:03:36.040> just<00:03:36.550> combines<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.270> back<00:03:37.740> like<00:03:38.740> so

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
there just combines on the back like so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.370 
there just combines on the back like so
and<00:03:40.330> there<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.170> go<00:03:42.270> that's<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.480> for<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.080> scene

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
and there you go that's it for the scene

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.270 
and there you go that's it for the scene
onnu<00:03:45.360> right<00:03:46.360> in<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.660> permafrost<00:03:46.990> review<00:03:47.950> for

lucky added that yeah again I recommend
this<00:03:56.620> minifigure<00:03:57.520> kind<00:03:58.210> of<00:03:58.270> like<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.390> small

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
this minifigure kind of like a small

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.390 
this minifigure kind of like a small
robot<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.290> machine<00:03:59.500> from<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.130> silla<00:04:00.370> kingdom

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
robot a machine from the silla kingdom
