00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
Shanghai levolution in your head when

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.030 
Shanghai levolution in your head when
you<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.659> about<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:40.079> kind<00:02:40.439> of<00:02:40.530> things<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you think about these kind of things and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.000 
you think about these kind of things and
as<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:42.120> know<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.659> doesn't<00:02:43.109> really<00:02:43.319> help<00:02:43.769> on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
as we know it doesn't really help on

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.770 
as we know it doesn't really help on
that<00:02:44.040> map<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> revolution<00:02:45.359> comes<00:02:45.510> down

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that map that the revolution comes down

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.720 
that map that the revolution comes down
it<00:02:45.930> doesn't<00:02:46.109> really<00:02:46.349> do<00:02:46.590> anything<00:02:46.829> apart<00:02:47.430> from

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
it doesn't really do anything apart from

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.490 
it doesn't really do anything apart from
make<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.180> map<00:02:48.389> flatter<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.170> little<00:02:49.409> bit

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
make the map flatter and a little bit

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.979 
make the map flatter and a little bit
harder<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:50.040> see<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.849> it's<00:02:51.030> good<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.299> hear<00:02:51.750> that

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
harder to see so it's good to hear that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.780 
harder to see so it's good to hear that

me is the hovercraft we're going to be
able<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.209> use<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.750> land<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.829> just

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.869 
how we're supposed to use a hovercraft I
had<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.799> couple<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.190> doubts<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.699> thought

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
had a couple of doubts that I thought

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.969 
had a couple of doubts that I thought
dice<00:03:39.150> might<00:03:39.540> not<00:03:39.780> include<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.199> sort<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.739> land

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
dice might not include the sort of land

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.979

maneuvers<00:03:41.549> for<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.819> hovercraft<00:03:42.359> but<00:03:42.870> it's

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
maneuvers for the hovercraft but it's

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.210 
maneuvers for the hovercraft but it's
really<00:03:43.290> good<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.500> hear<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.979> they're<00:03:44.099> going
