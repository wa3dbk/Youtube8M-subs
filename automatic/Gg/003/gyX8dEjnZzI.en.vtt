and recently this one is this one in

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:33.580 
and recently this one is this one in
quite<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.519> bad<00:03:17.409> bad<00:03:18.409> way<00:03:29.290> yeah<00:03:31.780> yeah<00:03:32.780> same<00:03:33.290> thing

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
quite a bad bad way yeah yeah same thing

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:56.850 
quite a bad bad way yeah yeah same thing
um<00:03:36.099> now<00:03:37.099> this<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.400> quite<00:03:37.639> this<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.209> question

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.490 

there<00:03:57.860> is<00:03:57.950> no<00:03:58.190> reason<00:03:58.610> why<00:03:58.880> anything<00:03:59.660> that

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
there is no reason why anything that

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.920 
there is no reason why anything that
looks<00:04:00.680> like<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.420> should<00:04:02.420> be<00:04:02.540> found<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
looks like that should be found in the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.170 
looks like that should be found in the
battery<00:04:03.230> of<00:04:03.320> a<00:04:03.380> phone<00:04:05.710> now<00:04:06.710> this<00:04:06.860> one<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:08.000> was

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
battery of a phone now this one this was

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.430 
battery of a phone now this one this was
actually<00:04:08.480> larger<00:04:08.930> than<00:04:10.630> some<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.930> these

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
actually larger than some of the these

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.080 
actually larger than some of the these
things<00:04:12.740> that<00:04:12.860> I've<00:04:12.950> seen<00:04:13.100> before<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.520> mean<00:04:13.850> I

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
things that I've seen before I mean I

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.930 
things that I've seen before I mean I
know<00:04:14.660> what<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:14.990> looks<00:04:15.110> like<00:04:15.320> I've<00:04:16.310> been<00:04:16.700> trying

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
know what it looks like I've been trying

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.340 
know what it looks like I've been trying
to<00:04:16.970> figure<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.330> out<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.540> mean<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.109> some

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
to figure this out I mean is this some

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.530 
to figure this out I mean is this some
kind<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.590> fractal<00:04:18.950> pattern<00:04:19.330> formed<00:04:20.330> by<00:04:20.480> the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
kind of fractal pattern formed by the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.830 
kind of fractal pattern formed by the
way<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.920> cell<00:04:22.130> discharges<00:04:22.790> I'm<00:04:23.600> going<00:04:23.780> to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
way the the cell discharges I'm going to

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.900 
way the the cell discharges I'm going to
feature<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.410> way<00:04:24.530> modern<00:04:25.100> phones<00:04:27.910> one

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
feature of the way modern phones one

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.140 
feature of the way modern phones one
phones<00:04:29.240> are<00:04:29.390> constructed<00:04:30.760> does<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:31.940> look

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
phones are constructed does that look

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.580 
phones are constructed does that look
like<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.390> fractal<00:04:32.630> does<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.320> look<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.470> a

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
like a fractal does that look like a

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.930 
like a fractal does that look like a
fractal<00:04:33.920> pun<00:04:36.220> now<00:04:37.220> um<00:04:39.340> either<00:04:40.340> say<00:04:40.550> some<00:04:40.820> of

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
fractal pun now um either say some of

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.470 
fractal pun now um either say some of
these<00:04:44.920> okay<00:04:45.920> well<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.160> got<00:04:46.850> some<00:04:46.970> other<00:04:47.090> samples

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
these okay well I got some other samples

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.270 
these okay well I got some other samples
I<00:04:47.630> got<00:04:47.780> some<00:04:47.960> other<00:04:48.320> sample<00:04:48.710> for<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.890> man<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.160> get

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
I got some other sample for a man to get

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.010 
I got some other sample for a man to get
out<00:04:49.340> work<00:04:49.790> couple<00:04:50.120> days<00:04:50.240> ago<00:04:50.450> before<00:04:50.630> things

out work couple days ago before things

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.480 
out work couple days ago before things
kicked<00:04:51.260> off<00:04:54.070> that's<00:04:55.070> somebody<00:04:55.340> obviously

I want to know where thee for the

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.760 
I want to know where thee for the
battery<00:05:04.810> recyclers<00:05:05.810> are<00:05:06.020> in<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:06.350> because

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
battery recyclers are in this because

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:36.509 
battery recyclers are in this because
you<00:05:07.310> can't<00:05:07.520> just<00:05:07.669> throw<00:05:07.850> away
