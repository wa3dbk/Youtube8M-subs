00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 I have had a quality and a fluency 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.340
 incredible you did not base yourself we 're going to go 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.809
 long distance but the following ones to the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 next I eliminate where the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.519
 man had already the level of fame that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.609
 Robert Clouse a real film director 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.100
 of martial arts occupied him in operation 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.650
 dragon and here the compadre shines because 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.460
 shows the great speed he had in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 his fist for you please see part 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.210
 as the temple is hot and we are 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.570
 you meet bravo and young man there is the one 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.570
 challenge 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.610
 the ones that have 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.720
 I hope your classic writing was the bully 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.610
 his sister and he always started 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.040
 pierce philosophies like this that I 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.450
 matter I think it's a table because 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.730
 pulls out 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.640
 thanks says the woods do not respond 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.800
 the exact plastic and look and here it looks 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.280
 the speed of his blows +7 107 18 in 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.280
 Leg 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.610
 what happens is that he makes a look with a 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.950
 chop show with blows of kung fu 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.660
 the Chinese look how fast he is and agile 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 with all the lice plus this operation 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.720
 dragon knows the wedding in the works of 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 Martial Arts 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.800
 in a second a second is calculable 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.800
 but it 's like that but without legs 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.920
 flying shit 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.600
 but attention the conspiracy is not done 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.310
 wait when we talk about books 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.560
 because I want to show you the last 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.530
 film that he managed to film and that only 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.270
 could be released post-mortem of being 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.890
 because it's a movie what's it called 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.340
 when it premieres something after 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.340
 someone dies 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.330
 or when he was afraid 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.910
 it exactly takes a lot of fat 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.380
 this is the game of death and this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 he goes out to what he invented another game of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.240
 video that I can think of something where the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.150
 protagonist go forward by 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.800
 platform and every time there is a boss 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.020
 powerful is only that he can only come to 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.450
 change platform shit a 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.970
 environment seen but by then like 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.850
 Game of Death attention because it is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.700
 curious because in this movie 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.100
 in the history of the film he is an actor 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.050
 he plays an actor that is like the 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.320
 people want him, they want to kill him and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.610
 They simulate his death through a form 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.130
 which is very curious that has to do with 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.130
 a descendant we go first with the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.300
 fight with natural chain is he beat 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.300
 someone goes up a level 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.590
 the list of great masters 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.060
 compadres were his disciples because 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.060
 he was famous saint was his pupil 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.160
 but nevertheless on one occasion the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.810
 Master Willie and his disciple fought and 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.700
 that of webber and inscribes as 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.720
 quick they had nothing to do that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.720
 with the fight every time 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.830
 above all, they will kick, look here 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.440
 we are seeing the event sent a 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.540
 tension movie because this is the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.280
 true 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.790
 like it looks a bit like someone 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.790
 I wanted to kill you realize 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.970
 Attention 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.960
 today we want them to pay us a fine if 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.630
 we want to put the business of al del 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.630
 traffic and he many times like the famous 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.940
 for his illicit business then he 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.310
 you want to fit in I am not countries I 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.530
 I believe in good what will not lead the 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.190
 people do not cancel it 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.889
 and look how he refused we're seeing the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.010
 filming the end of fist of fury and 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.290
 he jump a battle that shoots him but 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.639
 they put a real bullet in a 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.639
 gun this is the movie 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.900
 and they manage to kill the only way 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.919
 to prevent him from stopping the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.919
 mafia business 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.100
 is the famous scene of the end of the handful 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.100
 of fury 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.320
 who would say it is still happening in 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.060
 the real life mark of the angel of the 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.460
 nationality 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.310

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.440
 accident the subject to play against 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.440
 Internet

 that it was about that he died of that 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.840
 But years later his son 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.580
 during the mines they adored him in the type 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.289
 of landing like the houthis who 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.150
 He also fought very well and was very 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.210
 Sympathetic all night 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.620
 muÃ±oz real life in the same way that 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.759

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.590

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.130
 question in relation to kill bill 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.980
 we can stretching support the video 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.230
 while you know that there is a whole 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.030
 tribute to the film of 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.440
 Quentin Tarantino we are seeing the 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.080
 left game of death and the 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.750
 right to uma thurman who used the same 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.190
 kimono be aware there is a whole city 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.320
 tribute for attention test is because 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.270
 we are really wrote slow 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.330
 there was a person who has a producer 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.150
 friend of brooklyn and who made his life 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.830
 impossible in fact it took away two big 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.830
 projects that know that in the series 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.170
 it was like harry potter he did not have money 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.390
 he came out reaction of the three said I'll 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.590
 I need to earn money and said 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.050
 something happens to make a story and 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.790
 writing a restaurant presented it and I 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.400
 well I am the protagonist what super 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.170
 all right 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.250
 besides that the thought that was the 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:33.610
 series we are call two months three or 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.610
 four months 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.380
 equal its great producer that what I do 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.380
 more than one occasion 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.940
 in the movie with him exactly without 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.220
 But the channel's fault was not to blame 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.850
 in fucking producer friends of mine 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.850
 thank you
