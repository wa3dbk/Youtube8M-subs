00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
would have been oil varnish mix which I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
would have been oil varnish mix which I
really<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.610> didn't<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> wait<00:01:18.570> in

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
between coats for the Cure in event and
I<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:21.630> didn't<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.290> move<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> top

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I also didn't want to move the top

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.760 
I also didn't want to move the top
outside<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:24.090> stink<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.110> shop<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
outside or stink up my shop with that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
outside or stink up my shop with that
well<00:01:26.009> varnish<00:01:26.369> mix<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.270> decided<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.840> with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
well varnish mix so I decided to go with

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
well varnish mix so I decided to go with
a<00:01:28.020> couple<00:01:28.320> coats<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.710> shellac<00:01:28.770> which<00:01:29.520> were

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a couple coats of shellac which were

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.670 
a couple coats of shellac which were
really<00:01:30.000> quick<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> apply<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.439> hand

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
really quick to apply a little hand

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
really quick to apply a little hand
sanding<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.130> between<00:01:32.180> then<00:01:33.180> finish<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.540> off

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
sanding in between then finish it off

with<00:01:33.840> some<00:01:33.900> paste<00:01:34.259> wax<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> looks

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
with some paste wax and I think it looks

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.460 
with some paste wax and I think it looks
great

some things I learned along the way of
working<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.390> project<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:40.920> was<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
working on this project the first was to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
working on this project the first was to
make<00:01:41.549> sure<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.909> initial<00:01:42.390> work<00:01:42.570> surface<00:01:43.079> was

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
make sure my initial work surface was

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
make sure my initial work surface was
very<00:01:43.530> flat<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.040> level<00:01:44.220> obviously<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.479> set

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
very flat and level obviously that set

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.170 
very flat and level obviously that set
the<00:01:45.840> stage<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.409> rest<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.799> project

the stage for the rest of this project

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.460 
the stage for the rest of this project
the<00:01:48.180> next<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.659> goes<00:01:48.869> without<00:01:49.020> saying

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that they were exactly the same width

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
that they were exactly the same width
and<00:01:53.820> length<00:01:53.850> were<00:01:54.240> needed<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.049> my<00:01:55.200> story

up exactly with each other and I
double-checked<00:02:06.420> along<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.229> my

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
double-checked along the way with my

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.410 
double-checked along the way with my
finger<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.099> was

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
finger as I was

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.170 
finger as I was
and<00:02:08.959> gluing<00:02:09.229> them<00:02:09.319> together<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:10.069> did<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.090> to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and gluing them together I did have to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.670 
and gluing them together I did have to
do<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> little<00:02:11.630> bit<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.900> cleanup<00:02:12.140> with<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.380> block

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
do a little bit of cleanup with a block

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.680 
do a little bit of cleanup with a block
plane<00:02:12.709> afterwards<00:02:13.550> but<00:02:14.090> making<00:02:14.390> sure<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
plane afterwards but making sure the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.350 
plane afterwards but making sure the
internal<00:02:15.050> brood<00:02:15.410> was<00:02:15.560> very<00:02:15.830> flat<00:02:16.360> definitely

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
internal brood was very flat definitely

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.540 
internal brood was very flat definitely
led<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.750> how<00:02:17.959> flat<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.470> final<00:02:18.830> work<00:02:19.040> surface

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
led to how flat this final work surface

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.930 
led to how flat this final work surface
is<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:20.110> did<00:02:21.110> add<00:02:21.260> some<00:02:21.290> internal<00:02:21.830> pieces<00:02:22.340> where

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
is I did add some internal pieces where

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.880 
is I did add some internal pieces where
a<00:02:23.239> row<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.510> bench<00:02:23.690> dogs<00:02:23.900> might<00:02:24.260> go<00:02:24.440> here<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:24.800> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
a row of bench dogs might go here in the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.460 
a row of bench dogs might go here in the
future<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.640> where<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:26.270> Vice<00:02:26.540> attaches<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
future and where my Vice attaches to the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.040 
future and where my Vice attaches to the
front<00:02:27.760> but<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.790> didn't<00:02:29.030> add<00:02:29.150> any<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.630> other<00:02:29.660> way

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
front but I didn't add any the other way

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.770 
front but I didn't add any the other way
or<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.830> potential<00:02:31.310> table<00:02:31.670> vise<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.690> I

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
or for a potential table vise and if I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.300 
or for a potential table vise and if I
did<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.020> project<00:02:33.260> again<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.800> think<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.280> would

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
did this project again I think I would

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.430 
did this project again I think I would
add<00:02:34.550> more<00:02:34.910> filler<00:02:35.239> blocks<00:02:35.630> on<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.019> inside

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
add more filler blocks on the inside

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.800 
add more filler blocks on the inside
where<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.489> might<00:02:37.730> need<00:02:37.910> some<00:02:38.209> screwing

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
where I think I might need some screwing

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.080 
where I think I might need some screwing
holes<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.800> future<00:02:40.220> or<00:02:40.370> potential<00:02:40.880> bench

dogs and finally checking for flat at

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.090 
dogs and finally checking for flat at
each<00:02:44.209> step<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.690> process<00:02:44.750> made<00:02:45.680> sure<00:02:45.890> that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
each step in the process made sure that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.949 
each step in the process made sure that
nothing<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.519> was<00:02:46.670> doing<00:02:47.030> was<00:02:47.450> adversely

nothing I was doing was adversely

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.690 
nothing I was doing was adversely
affecting<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.709> way<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.010> final<00:02:49.459> product

affecting the way to final product

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.900 
affecting the way to final product
litter<00:02:50.150> now<00:02:50.890> I'm<00:02:51.890> very<00:02:51.950> excited<00:02:52.610> about<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
litter now I'm very excited about the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.820 
litter now I'm very excited about the
way<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.269> project<00:02:53.750> turned<00:02:54.019> out<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.620> top

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
way that this project turned out the top

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.009 
way that this project turned out the top
is<00:02:55.040> extremely<00:02:55.730> flat<00:02:56.060> which<00:02:56.299> is<00:02:56.420> exactly<00:02:56.870> what

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
is extremely flat which is exactly what

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.090 
is extremely flat which is exactly what
I<00:02:57.049> was<00:02:57.110> looking<00:02:57.170> for<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.799> seems<00:02:58.010> very

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
I was looking for and it seems very

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.550 
I was looking for and it seems very
stable<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.330> looks<00:02:59.510> great<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.080> greets<00:03:00.380> me

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
stable and it looks great and greets me
