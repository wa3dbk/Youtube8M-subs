shadow complex and they could make a
sequel<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:57.079> because<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.350> long

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
complex like the Omega armor anyway they

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.719 
complex like the Omega armor anyway they
could<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.160> doing<00:02:08.399> something<00:02:08.489> completely

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
could be doing something completely

company they tend to leave a lot of bugs
unfixed<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.230> don't<00:02:40.220> really<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.970> um

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
unfixed and I don't really like that um

unfixed and I don't really like that um
I<00:02:41.920> can<00:02:42.920> understand<00:02:43.459> why<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.880> happens<00:02:46.000> they

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
I can understand why that happens they

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.809 
I can understand why that happens they
do<00:02:47.060> get<00:02:47.360> bashed<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.870> lot<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:49.310> not<00:02:49.430> fixing<00:02:49.610> these

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
do get bashed a lot for not fixing these

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.390 
do get bashed a lot for not fixing these
bugs<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.720> did<00:02:50.989> want<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.440> touch<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.340> that

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
bugs and I did want to touch on that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.820 
bugs and I did want to touch on that
because<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.150> do<00:02:53.600> have<00:02:53.720> an<00:02:53.900> opinion<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.590> and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
because I do have an opinion on it and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.890 
because I do have an opinion on it and
my<00:02:55.280> opinion<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.760> chair<00:02:56.299> like<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.750> said

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
my opinion is that chair like I said

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.270 
my opinion is that chair like I said
shares<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.290> very<00:02:57.500> different<00:02:57.739> kind<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.920> company

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
shares a very different kind of company

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.840 
shares a very different kind of company
and<00:02:58.519> they<00:02:59.299> um<00:03:01.000> see<00:03:02.000> how<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.239> word<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.870> they

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
and they um see how I word this they

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.340 
and they um see how I word this they
like<00:03:04.850> their<00:03:05.780> overeager<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.920> guess<00:03:07.190> too<00:03:08.350> they

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
like their overeager I guess too they

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.350 
like their overeager I guess too they
have<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.500> lot<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> ideas<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.519> they're<00:03:10.970> over<00:03:11.269> you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
have a lot of ideas and they're over you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.809 
have a lot of ideas and they're over you
get<00:03:11.660> those<00:03:11.780> ideas<00:03:12.080> out<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.290> window<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.680> they

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
get those ideas out the window so they

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.370 
get those ideas out the window so they
prioritize<00:03:13.819> eating<00:03:14.180> those<00:03:14.329> ideas<00:03:14.690> into<00:03:15.019> the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
prioritize eating those ideas into the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.780 
prioritize eating those ideas into the
game's<00:03:15.850> over<00:03:16.850> fixing<00:03:17.810> bugs<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.609> that's<00:03:19.609> one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
game's over fixing bugs and that's one

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.979 
game's over fixing bugs and that's one
of<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.940> reason<00:03:20.180> they<00:03:20.239> don't<00:03:20.359> fix<00:03:20.570> bugs<00:03:20.840> the

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
of the reason they don't fix bugs the

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.270 
of the reason they don't fix bugs the
other<00:03:21.109> reason<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.920> were<00:03:21.980> really

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
other reason is that they were really

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.849 
other reason is that they were really
rushed<00:03:22.670> for<00:03:22.940> infinitely<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.500> think<00:03:24.530> for

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
rushed for infinitely to and I think for

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.349 
rushed for infinitely to and I think for
infinitely<00:03:25.220> long<00:03:25.489> as<00:03:25.640> well<00:03:25.790> i'm<00:03:25.850> not<00:03:25.970> sure<00:03:26.180> but

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
infinitely long as well i'm not sure but

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.970 
infinitely long as well i'm not sure but
i<00:03:26.510> am<00:03:26.720> sure<00:03:26.750> about<00:03:27.019> village<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.799> they<00:03:27.859> only

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
i am sure about village and they only

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.319 
i am sure about village and they only
had<00:03:28.130> six<00:03:28.400> months<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.700> involve<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.120> game

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
had six months to involve that game

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.970 
had six months to involve that game
which<00:03:29.540> sounds<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.410> lot<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:30.829> more<00:03:30.920> a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
which sounds like a lot but it's more a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.099 
which sounds like a lot but it's more a
lot<00:03:31.160> from<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:32.090> being<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.810> size<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:34.540> yeah<00:03:35.540> so

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
lot from it being that size and yeah so

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.349 
lot from it being that size and yeah so
for<00:03:36.470> infinity<00:03:36.769> played<00:03:36.980> three<00:03:37.430> although<00:03:38.090> that

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
for infinity played three although that

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.390 
for infinity played three although that
with<00:03:38.660> dungeons<00:03:39.140> coming<00:03:39.470> out<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.280> would

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
with dungeons coming out and that would

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.699 
with dungeons coming out and that would
give<00:03:40.430> them<00:03:40.579> a<00:03:40.609> little<00:03:40.790> break<00:03:41.170> or<00:03:42.170> not<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.410> break

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
give them a little break or not a break

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.140 
give them a little break or not a break
that<00:03:42.950> was<00:03:43.070> given<00:03:43.340> more<00:03:43.489> time<00:03:43.730> they'll<00:03:44.000> fly

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
that was given more time they'll fly

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.110 
that was given more time they'll fly
over<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.570> year<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.530> develop<00:03:45.680> infinity<00:03:46.489> blade<00:03:46.579> 3

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
over a year to develop infinity blade 3

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.250 
over a year to develop infinity blade 3
which<00:03:47.930> i<00:03:48.500> mean<00:03:49.070> i<00:03:49.430> don't<00:03:49.730> know<00:03:49.790> about<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.000> but
