comments section below and let's start a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.460 
comments section below and let's start a
conversation<00:00:43.630> about<00:00:43.720> that<00:00:43.989> maybe<00:00:44.200> we<00:00:44.320> can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
conversation about that maybe we can

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.140 
conversation about that maybe we can
learn<00:00:44.620> something<00:00:44.680> from<00:00:45.010> each<00:00:45.160> other<00:00:45.430> okay<00:00:45.640> so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
learn something from each other okay so

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.240 
learn something from each other okay so
we're<00:00:46.420> gonna<00:00:46.510> use<00:00:46.600> this<00:00:46.989> one<00:00:47.380> groove<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:48.070> do

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
we're gonna use this one groove to do

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.100 
we're gonna use this one groove to do
this<00:00:48.430> why<00:00:48.670> are<00:00:48.790> we<00:00:48.910> using<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.360> groove<00:00:49.630> all<00:00:49.930> too

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
this why are we using a groove all too

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.740 
this why are we using a groove all too
often<00:00:50.290> whenever<00:00:51.160> we<00:00:51.309> go<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.489> we<00:00:51.850> isolate<00:00:52.449> limbs

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
often whenever we go to we isolate limbs

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.750 
often whenever we go to we isolate limbs
which<00:00:53.019> is<00:00:53.170> great<00:00:53.500> they<00:00:53.739> need<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.519> that<00:00:54.640> we

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
which is great they need that so that we

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.700 
which is great they need that so that we
can<00:00:54.790> get<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.809> fundamentals<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.620> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
can get the the fundamentals and the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.290 
can get the the fundamentals and the
basics<00:00:56.769> down<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.519> we<00:00:57.670> can<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.150> can

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
basics down so that we can we can

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.360 
basics down so that we can we can
improve<00:00:58.629> in<00:00:58.809> that<00:00:58.960> area<00:00:59.320> but<00:00:59.559> whenever<00:01:00.220> we

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
improve in that area but whenever we

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.119 
improve in that area but whenever we
come<00:01:00.580> to<00:01:00.699> add<00:01:00.850> them<00:01:01.210> back<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.559> kit<00:01:02.860> which

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
come to add them back to the kit which

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.530 
come to add them back to the kit which
we're<00:01:03.339> all<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.970> know<00:01:04.000> if<00:01:04.239> we're<00:01:04.360> gonna<00:01:04.420> be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
we're all you know if we're gonna be

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.850 
we're all you know if we're gonna be

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600 
we're gonna be playing with all four
limbs<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:08.110> when<00:01:08.230> we<00:01:08.350> come<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.740> add<00:01:08.890> them<00:01:09.250> back

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
limbs so when we come to add them back

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.760 
limbs so when we come to add them back
to<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.330> drum<00:01:10.600> set<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:11.050> where<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:11.320> encounter

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
to the drum set is where we encounter

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.340 
to the drum set is where we encounter
some<00:01:12.130> problems<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:12.820> this<00:01:13.000> exercise<00:01:13.450> will

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
some problems so this exercise will

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.620 
some problems so this exercise will
hopefully<00:01:14.560> help<00:01:15.159> you<00:01:15.520> sort<00:01:16.270> some<00:01:16.450> of<00:01:16.540> that

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
hopefully help you sort some of that

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.810 
hopefully help you sort some of that
kick<00:01:16.870> drum<00:01:17.050> some<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.830> those<00:01:17.920> kick<00:01:18.130> drum<00:01:18.340> issues

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
clarity that's what we're looking for

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.000 
clarity that's what we're looking for
when<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.810> comes<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.200> kick<00:01:23.410> drum<00:01:23.680> it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
when it comes to the kick drum it

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.980 
when it comes to the kick drum it
doesn't<00:01:24.370> matter<00:01:24.550> if<00:01:24.820> it's<00:01:24.970> fast<00:01:25.300> if<00:01:25.600> it's<00:01:25.780> not

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
doesn't matter if it's fast if it's not

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.810 
doesn't matter if it's fast if it's not
clear<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:26.740> if<00:01:26.830> you're<00:01:26.950> doing<00:01:27.280> really<00:01:27.550> fast

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
clear so if you're doing really fast

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.670 
clear so if you're doing really fast
double<00:01:28.240> strokes<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.810> they're<00:01:29.230> not<00:01:29.350> clear

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
double strokes and they're not clear

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.930 
double strokes and they're not clear
double<00:01:30.010> strokes<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.340> doesn't<00:01:30.640> matter<00:01:30.820> that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
double strokes it doesn't matter that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.250 
double strokes it doesn't matter that
you're<00:01:31.210> doing<00:01:31.390> them<00:01:31.690> because<00:01:31.810> they're<00:01:32.140> just

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
you're doing them because they're just

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.310 
you're doing them because they're just
sloppy<00:01:32.590> now<00:01:33.580> you'll<00:01:34.240> find<00:01:34.600> in<00:01:34.870> this<00:01:35.020> group

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
sloppy now you'll find in this group

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.500 
sloppy now you'll find in this group
that<00:01:35.350> we<00:01:35.650> have<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:36.160> three<00:01:36.670> note<00:01:36.880> hit<00:01:37.180> with<00:01:37.390> the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
that we have a three note hit with the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.110 
that we have a three note hit with the
kick<00:01:37.690> drum<00:01:37.720> at<00:01:38.110> one<00:01:38.320> point<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.060> people

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
kick drum at one point a lot of people

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.460 
kick drum at one point a lot of people
don't<00:01:40.360> understand<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.020> way<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.200> get

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
don't understand that the way to get

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.980 
don't understand that the way to get
better<00:01:41.710> at<00:01:41.920> doubles<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.570> start<00:01:43.810> doing

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
better at doubles is to start doing

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.070 
better at doubles is to start doing
longer<00:01:44.500> combinations<00:01:45.370> on<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.610> single<00:01:46.180> hand<00:01:46.420> so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
longer combinations on a single hand so

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.380 
longer combinations on a single hand so
to<00:01:47.140> do<00:01:47.320> triples<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:47.950> fours<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.820> fives<00:01:48.850> on<00:01:49.360> a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
to do triples and fours and fives on a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.020 
to do triples and fours and fives on a
single<00:01:49.870> hand<00:01:50.230> and<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.920> more<00:01:51.370> you<00:01:51.520> improve<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
