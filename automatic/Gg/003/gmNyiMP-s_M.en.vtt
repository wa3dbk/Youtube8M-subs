00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.719
 and in the port of saints 2.0 at 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.130
 better not I have no idea and the hundreds 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.779
 writings of the docked of the day unintentionally 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 be looking at the camera good the case to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.930
 the best stevie of this 2.0 race 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.359
 the best of madrid why then because 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 They forgive me a cow for some 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 days and I'm going to spend the point 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.699
 no and I do not get it, God affected but yes 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.660
 alright 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:41.730
 it catches me a day or so or all and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
 last night I recorded perfectly 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 but and down the street when I'm 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 Talking about this, it is so pixelated 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.530
 which already my face to wash it I suppose will be 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.659
 so ugly that the megapixel camera does not 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.699
 he could record a letter 11 he noted that he can 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.530
 be the great theory of life but now 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.899
 yes, kidding 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
 in that or that is sometimes pixelated 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.159
 I think it's because there's too much light 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.360
 I guess I have no idea but that's the 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.850
 big problem that I have with my new 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.380
 bed so if anyone knows the solution 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.560
 Well, if you leave it for comments 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 I will appreciate quite achieved but good 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 it's a length of 900 I do not know how much and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.369
 shine the walt red with the side part 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 of the car and I stay there like a kangaroo 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 in plan on a fence of life nor the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.880
 Kangaroos do not stay on top of the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.329
 grid 2 012 that suddenly the image 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.329
 of a kangaroo 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.270
 it's normal because I'm focused on the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.270
 etna 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.680
 the key is to go around 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.660
 very quickly to be able to throw the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.150
 body go well live jump and float 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.710
 in fact the car has been set apart from 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.180
 be the car in steep plan you know with 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.680
 a video that was made entirely by hand 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.070
 obviously the car is called palau 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.960
 and that's why I do not shut up thanks to them 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 now well well well well taken 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.720
 around here it's worth it but if it's already the juve 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.759
 above 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.590
 why are we going 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 to see eye because what is said are three or 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.960
 three laps we have time we have 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.730
 time and we go third interesting data 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.830
 let's go to me happens I'll spend five 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.430
 villages here I have jumped to such power 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.800
 that do not make fun of their best moments 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.600
 there is perfect well fine well 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.700
 we continue third we have in position to 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.260
 mister christophe low bar 15 you know 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.439
 It has the name of Star Wars robot 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.610
 so let's see if he gets caught 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:58.470
 I do not understand the glass I do not feel it 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.360
 I did not identify it well 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.650
 well fine well well also with 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.319
 kinematics and plan but in plan 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.920
 perfect eye movies we follow 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.920

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.290
 life is very hard we just lost 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.930

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.280
 all the stops just happens to me 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.280
 when I have to jump if I do not follow 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.959
 guys it was all controlled to fall 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.250
 just in that way and not explode 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.560
 someone wants to grow what creates it 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.139

 I do not have enough power if we want 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.639

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.710
 if anyone knows the why then I will 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.670
