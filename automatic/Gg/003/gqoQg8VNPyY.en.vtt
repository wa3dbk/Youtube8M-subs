00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.700
 I'm going to teach you how to put a 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.390
 game completed 100% in your 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.180
 goal 5 of the xbox the first thing that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.189
 we need is that the game then to the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.699
 memory that we use for games of 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.699
 the xbox is a usb memory a pendrive 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.470
 is the program this horizon this 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.840
 program that we have here 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.040
 and download 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.930
 Well, this time 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.770
 for example I have this game 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.190
 downloaded this file 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.740
 what we do is we take the file 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.540
 we bring from the file rar 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:00.670
 we open the program now and with 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.670
 open program we plug in the usb 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.080
 we do it from memory of the xbox 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.080
 let's go here 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.650
 in this case then 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.370
 if we give him here 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.730
 we open gta 5 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.750
 and here we give for example to your 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.750
 last part 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.110
 anywhere 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.290
 you can also do it this way what 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.290
 we open 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.760
 we go to the desk 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.750
 desktop we look for the extracted file 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 here it is and we would click on it 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.100
 we would do in the file we would open 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.100
 and it would get 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.250
 then we would accept the message not 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.950
 come out and the game would already be stuck 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.140
 we would take it to our xbox done 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.690
 we would do the memory and with the memory 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.979
 plugged in we would give you to load the last 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.960
 heading in which it is completed at 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.960
 100% and that's it 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.220
 and hit like if you like to comment 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.300

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 hiding places there 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.700
