00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.399
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.810
 new commentary on my channel 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.220
 I have the sound a bit today 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.170
 louder asked because you see already 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.160
 what it should be about today and indeed 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.660
 search and destroy 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.759
 I 'm actually in the dlc pack now 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.529
 looking for a bit more for the first time 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.119
 played to the star I rotate my da 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.710
 the maps just and have to play this 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.630
 what is given to you and have there 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.220
 we pretty much believe four or five 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.019
 round long in a row have the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.029
 teams and everyone always try to 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.890
 Strengthened and in the case I have 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.660
 actually found very interesting and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.129
 i want to give you a few tips today and 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.109
 The tricks give me that in the game 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.789
 are noticed in search destroy in 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.100
 black ops two years are playing here 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.730
 on the floor web from the apple calypso 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.920
 Clubs serve them take off the map exactly 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.320
 just that you know a remake that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.030
 he marathon from my service and on 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.679
 every case is the first point 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.179
 what do you have to pay attention to? 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.460
 a few rough points 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.199
 Step 1 next to a weapon with which it 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.969
 actually some degree of certainty 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.620
 well familiar with her since in the 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.179
 case I have the unintentionally the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.549
 had scorpions with me if I wanted 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.170
 something else also play other 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.290
 Gameplay from the gameplay you can see it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.670
 then at some point where and yes and me 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.079
 would actually diamond with it 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.400
 forgot to pack on it would have 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.649
 looked a bit cool but so 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.229
 Also fits as step first takes 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.659
 to her find the weapon with the well 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.119
 so little on larger maps such as 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.220
 then I have to frost with the then 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.420
 kg game world because you have bigger 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.210
 distance and he can do better 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.740
 patrolling and yes on long range 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.390
 and short distance both sides 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.560
 cover reasonably well 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.420
 In that case, I thought so okay 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 I try the monument and why 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.119
 I always went downstairs at the beginning 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.590
 I do not know myself 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.909
 because I have to go with it before 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.350
 head together okay think where are the 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.939
 opponent where do you go just how could 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.759
 I personally go and that 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.500
 all the better cover now better 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.759
 to penetrate the opponents around it in such a way 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.950
 express 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.750
 but I already said that's it 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.399
 first point or second really very 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.200
 very important point that actually me 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.030
 in modern warfare 2 and destroy 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.720
 actually was the sound was like that 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.150
 So watch out, you just listen 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.620
 he's sneaking around like me 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.760
 in front of the opponent 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.740
 You really do not hear anything about it 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.420
 I do not like to play games 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.760
 destroy black ops 2 resp 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.830
 In which game should you make real sound like that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.080
 neglecting that can do just that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.180
 actually the skill or the right one 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 good game in black ops mode of operation 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.630
 in a fps shooter that one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.570
 really can react to everything 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.670
 That's why I recommend you for a game 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.960
 and you can ok because you need 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.570
 if you are accordingly the opponents good 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.050
 at least one dolby can orient 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.610
 digital dolby digital one that knows 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.930
 but to the right or left comes 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.700
 that vista maybe if you are now 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.530
 ever played for two in the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.750
 case it's pretty good i have one 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.340
 7.1 headset of which I can in 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.420
 postage was pretty much off for two of me 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.370
 offer but I am just stop 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.140
 little bit of this here in this mode 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.730
 very difficult to arrange 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.250
 Of course, such things as for example 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 I have just heard these shops 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.630
 acquire and permanent I have 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.459
 another player belongs to him or 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.570
 Therefore, opponents have killed Klack 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.430
 next to me do not hear this shock 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.260
 charge namely automatically known ok in 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.400
 my environment is someone so fits 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.410
 really on your environment and 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.940
 consider where it is appropriate against 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.050
 the place on you always really has to 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.120
 look where are the area i have the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.890
 Checked corners ok she plans her in the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.239
 moment before he starts to shoot the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.940
 opponents over there sit the corner higher 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.489
 Immediately fade out and can the round 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.290
 still claim for us yes I'm with 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.610
 a 15 0 in leadership by which one 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.860
 Of course you say okay you really have to 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.500
 beware where could be against it 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.940
 maybe hide where you have earlier 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.320
 So if you go for example 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.540
 this point where we just blinded 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.250
 have at a is okay there can either 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.780
 so fight upstairs on the house if 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.230
 he played more often you know what 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.180
 I mean 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.260
 or he is just waiting in a corner waiting 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.780
 on you or as in the case here 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.880
 direct view of the thing who can 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.170
 I cover both a and b so from that 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.180
 We've speculated a bit on that 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.950
 Eventually arise because the very free 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 lying is of course that varies from 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.330
 web to map in the case was of course the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.600
 obvious variant where we blind 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.940
 yes and as a box as a perks whole now 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.650
 not box would not necessarily now 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.390
 example, plunderers have it because I 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.160
 mine that it is so short the rounds 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.260
 you take other things with you 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.000
 should possibly be more practical for 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.380
 then you are something like mufflers 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.180
 on the weapon is also very much 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.910
 important and recommended by the bucks 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.130
 in any case if he plays the game 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.230
 every case you have seen the matron 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.459
 Katrin fought and in that case he has 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.960
 get me now 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.750
 yes I change 27 in the answer yes and 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.090
 as already said on the silencer 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.010
 quite interesting to destroy when 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.180
 one is better then or opponents and 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.950
 Do not betray yourself if you are 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.030
 decide I do not give it ja 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.710
 no silencer out of it 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.730
 simple reason that's not really 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.350
 my looking destroy class 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.510
 or I have none 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.710
 seek destroy class and from the 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.900
 I still have the data here for killstreaks 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.160
 has the children at the beginning 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.280
 quite handy with the opponents 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.810
 at least once from the body position 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.880
 gets away or at least a camper 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.400
 obviously somewhere out there camp 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.600
 Well under control you can do that 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.780
 can control everything a little bit 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.070
 an opponent less is always important and 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.660
 I'll say that's it for that 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.550
 Today's tips and tricks video him 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.440
 seek and destroy in black ops 2 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.570
 very many rooms take off you write 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.430
 in the comments what you are looking for 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.680
 always destroy it so take something with you 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.860
 could you recommend which weapon take 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.320
 you for which web eg sk with media in 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.390
 schalke the war or yes, how it looks 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.790
 setup yourself from trying to bother you in the 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.840
 black from 2 and in the sense one writes 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.580
 the comments are from the video 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.170
 Have a rating 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.170
