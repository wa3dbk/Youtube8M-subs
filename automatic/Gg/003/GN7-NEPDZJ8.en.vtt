I've been doing these uh what I'm
thinking<00:00:16.890> about<00:00:16.949> doing<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.699> certain<00:00:18.449> maps

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
thinking about doing on certain maps

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.630 
thinking about doing on certain maps
like<00:00:19.910> I<00:00:21.350> guess<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> routes<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> take<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
like I guess the routes that I take and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390 
like I guess the routes that I take and
why<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> take<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.740> what<00:00:26.279> I'm

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
why I take them and just what I'm

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.370 
why I take them and just what I'm
thinking<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.180> point<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.539> time<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:28.080> I'm

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.659 

doing<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.619> doing<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:32.099> don't<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.520> how<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
doing what I'm doing I don't know how to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.860 
doing what I'm doing I don't know how to
explain<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:34.370> you'll<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:36.239> I'm<00:00:36.390> like

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
explain it but you'll see what I'm like

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.360 
explain it but you'll see what I'm like
my<00:00:37.050> thought<00:00:37.350> processes<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
my thought processes when I'm like the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
my thought processes when I'm like the
decisions<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.809> whatever<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.350> want<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
decisions I make or whatever you want to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529 
decisions I make or whatever you want to
call<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.950> well<00:00:44.640> anyways<00:00:44.969> let's<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
call it well anyways let's get to it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.450 
call it well anyways let's get to it
earlier<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.710> saw<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.010> teammate<00:00:47.340> was

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
earlier you saw my teammate was

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.000 
earlier you saw my teammate was
capturing<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.750> like

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
capturing be and then I was like

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.900 
capturing be and then I was like
sometimes<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.860> I'll<00:00:52.860> barely<00:00:53.610> run

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
sometimes I time it and I'll barely run

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
sometimes I time it and I'll barely run
over<00:00:54.239> B<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> flag<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.800> I'll<00:00:56.190> still<00:00:56.430> capture

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
over B or a flag and I'll still capture

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.630 
over B or a flag and I'll still capture
it<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> time<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.129> i<00:00:59.430> watch

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it and it's because I time it i watch

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
it and it's because I time it i watch
how<00:00:59.879> many<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.570> teammates<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> flag

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
how many of my teammates are on the flag

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.299 
how many of my teammates are on the flag
and<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.979> amount<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.010> time<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and I time how the amount of time it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
and I time how the amount of time it
takes<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.610> capture<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.900> certain

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
takes to capture it with a certain

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
takes to capture it with a certain
amount<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.710> teammates<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.630> why

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
amount of teammates on it and that's why

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
amount of teammates on it and that's why
you<00:01:09.869> saw<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:10.380> barely<00:01:11.040> run<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> flag<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you saw me barely run on the flag and I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.609 
you saw me barely run on the flag and I
still<00:01:12.330> captured<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:13.680> though<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> died

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
still captured it even though I died

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.670 
still captured it even though I died
knowing<00:01:17.240> when<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> run<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> flag<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.530> do

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
knowing when to run over a flag to do

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.050 
knowing when to run over a flag to do
that<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.880> takes<00:01:21.530> practice<00:01:22.759> well<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> wouldn't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that it takes practice well I wouldn't

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
that it takes practice well I wouldn't
say<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> takes<00:01:24.479> practice<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.170> takes<00:01:25.350> some

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
say it takes practice it takes some

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.370 
say it takes practice it takes some
little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> timing<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:28.110> your

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
little bit of timing and just your

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.069 
little bit of timing and just your
knowledge<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.100> fast<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.600> map<00:01:30.810> gets

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
knowledge of how fast the map gets

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.999 
knowledge of how fast the map gets
captured<00:01:31.350> whenever<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:33.110> saw<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> nice<00:01:34.380> Triple<00:01:34.829> C

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
captured whenever I saw a nice Triple C

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
captured whenever I saw a nice Triple C
for<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.610> takes<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> timing

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
for it just takes a little bit of timing

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
for it just takes a little bit of timing
and<00:01:39.900> knowing<00:01:40.680> how<00:01:40.860> long<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.520> flag<00:01:41.939> takes<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and knowing how long a flag takes to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.109 
and knowing how long a flag takes to
capture<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.340> certain<00:01:44.729> amount<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
capture with the certain amount of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
capture with the certain amount of
teammates<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> i'm<00:01:46.590> using<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> lost

not sound cocky but once you're running
these<00:02:12.550> kind<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:12.910> things<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.390> pretty<00:02:13.660> hard

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
these kind of things it's pretty hard

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.500 
these kind of things it's pretty hard
