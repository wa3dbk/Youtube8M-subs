00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 Michael the match is still alive 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 a pretty new discipline of the again 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 Actually, there are special ones 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.070
 routes for or you can only 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.829
 use normal route 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.690
 Of course you can be absolute 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.269
 Beginners also normal many good 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.489
 use and will be very fast the 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.089
 disadvantages of this ordinary route 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.699
 recognize 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.820
 It is super important that we have a route 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.500
 have an extremely soft action 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.059
 The race was I already have mine 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.220
 had a hand and I have a bit 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.330
 back and forth, the level is what moves 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.559
 that stops for a soft one knows that 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.059
 yes from the normal many routers 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 actually, of course, we are right 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.470
 say here we have after the bungee 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.110
 worked principle 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.270
 very important when eating straight again 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.510
 also with the boliden the bites are very 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.400
 aggressive if he once has the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.040
 itself hooks effect of this short 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.659
 forefathers shoots terribly in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
 one direction and then one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.009
 then you can have a very hard route 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 often suffer a break or that break 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 is probably the slot then 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 outside or rice just gone and from there 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.000
 we have a super elastic here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.700
 route really built the chambers almost 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.070
 a semicircular because that has a 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.830
 through the top the route is called 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.240
 Many brokers get it out of their 18th 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 and if you are here in much ostrich father 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.810
 you have the huge grilling but joy 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.150
 you do not have to be afraid that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.890
 here under the join so as me 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.990
 the route had the first rolls the new 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.970
 At first we failed that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.390
 It is necessary to know about throwing conditionally 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.070
 by this extremely soft action is 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 Of course, this throw direction in the first 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340
 moment to small little difficult too 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.070
 officers 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.260
 I have then but in some phases 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.239
 just get used to it 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.519
 pull that off withstand the route the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.920
 almost unbreakable and then you can 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.080
 again quite usual with it again and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.940
 but usually throw it with it 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.409
 simply force through no fear 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.510
 then this flexibility is at 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.870
 Throwed backward to the rear 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.370
 leaned back then comes the return 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.290
 to use and then you can see synonymous 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.610
 that the draft perfectly slides forward 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.110
 how one is used to it 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 I saw you have too 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.030
 normal repeats it completely right 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.599
 this is from the high-quality series 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.000
 the twelve series 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.890
 the ultra light 40 has a length 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.810
 of three meters 52 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.920
 that's the profi china you can see too 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.959
 be on the obstacle 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.390
 Of course you can also eat it 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.390
 many also use it relatively 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.879
 soft also makes a good curve one 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.629
 but must say fair so the 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.060
 fair trute is really nice too 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.920
 fish you can see that the third 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.200
 important very different and just spring 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.170
 these powerful vehemently cursed much 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.159
 better off we are right now but in the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.730
 start at a professional 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.269
 fair trute ready for the m12 vacation 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.920
 put 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.079
 I have there already various bruster in 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.359
 Preparation also partly with 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.739
 continuous peaks possibly 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.500
 is also what tips with boarding 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.079
 I came up with some new ideas 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 and of course that will be for 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:41.099
 the professional fair federer a great device 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.139
 which leaves nothing to be desired ok good 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.669
 router now worked as far as think 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.709
 I'll let's go to the second 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.310
 important equipment parts comes that is 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.419
 the role 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.549
 this is normal there is no belief 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.849
 normal most stationary role 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.370
 here also from the series ideal together 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.030
 have developed with balzer in the case 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.590
 the sinti capelight again 7400 that is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.470
 a role of the order of magnitude 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.849
 really perfect for those distances 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.230
 on pass the distances in 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.290
 Exhibition area is usually 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.690
 between thirty and fifty feet seventy eighty 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.620
 You will not normally get that meter 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.910
 fish if it really times 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.169
 is required because you would the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.000
 ordinary many route then too 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.460
 need for these extreme profits 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.440
 in that case a nice little one 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.840
 handy stationary roll 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.490
 7 um, too, so you do not need it 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.020
 such a huge klotz in any case that 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.880
 I would advise against it 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.060
 everything should be easy and somewhere 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.140
 be filigree what i definitely 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.030
 would recommend 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.900
 you can see that here too i have 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.009
 here is a mono many leashes on it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.820
 I think that's not the no 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.590
 I still have the last one 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.780
 World Cup in Belgium on the 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.880
 I have not played that yet 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.580
 just an example of a mono 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.889
 a lot of small ones I personally very often 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.820
 with the tornado cord 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.039
 but you can also do several others 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.479
 We will be using makes with you soon 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.940
 Of course there with corresponding 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.160
 products come onto the market 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.660
 background is just that that stops 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.300
 the mono a lot alone because of her 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.210
 Stretch these strong ones, too 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.870
 I have to weigh myself in parallel 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.330
 Markus and I are here today 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.490
 I assemble two different routes 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.870
 have an ordinary on my route 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.639
 braided string on it because I am today 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.199
 with the nature pictures fischer speaks with 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.030
 maggots or maybe with worm 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:32.470
 so far, they will be better 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.389
 transfer longer before fold and for 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.460
 This area slaughters especially with the 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.500
 bullys I would always be here 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.500
 a mono many leash recommend
