no<00:01:38.320> not<00:01:38.680> even<00:01:38.770> close<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:39.729> then<00:01:39.880> he<00:01:39.969> of

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
no not even close to it but then he of

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.819 
no not even close to it but then he of
course<00:01:40.329> he<00:01:40.570> goes<00:01:40.750> back<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.020> Trump<00:01:41.380> sit<00:01:41.649> with

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
course he goes back and Trump sit with

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.580 
course he goes back and Trump sit with
Marco<00:01:42.340> Royce<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.899> makes<00:01:44.079> it<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.380> one's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
Marco Royce and that makes it to one's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.080 
Marco Royce and that makes it to one's
hopefully<00:01:44.920> there's<00:01:45.189> no<00:01:45.280> come<00:01:45.490> back<00:01:45.700> from<00:01:45.880> him

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
hopefully there's no come back from him

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.359 
hopefully there's no come back from him
Lyla<00:01:46.750> it's<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.079> bit<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:47.350> here<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.310> do

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
Lyla it's a bit like here but I do

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.889 
Lyla it's a bit like here but I do
actually<00:01:48.579> manage<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.030> get<00:01:49.149> another<00:01:49.420> long<00:01:49.630> trip

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
actually manage to get another long trip

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.690 
actually manage to get another long trip
with<00:01:49.990> Cristiano<00:01:50.560> from<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:51.070> outside<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.520> box

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
with Cristiano from just outside the box

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.209 
with Cristiano from just outside the box
we<00:01:52.539> make<00:01:52.719> it<00:01:52.960> 3-1<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.560> think<00:01:53.799> that<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.009> in<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
we make it 3-1 I think that is in the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.340 
we make it 3-1 I think that is in the
70th<00:01:54.670> minute<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.180> but<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:55.780> think<00:01:56.020> he<00:01:56.140> comes

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
70th minute and but I think he comes

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.770 
70th minute and but I think he comes
back<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.619> scores<00:01:57.159> one<00:01:57.850> more<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.329> then<00:01:58.539> I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
back and scores one more and then I

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.749 
back and scores one more and then I
think<00:01:59.109> I<00:01:59.320> think<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.740> game<00:01:59.920> is<00:01:59.950> seen<00:02:00.369> out<00:02:00.579> and

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
think I think the game is seen out and

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.209 
think I think the game is seen out and
but<00:02:01.359> anyway<00:02:01.570> he<00:02:01.719> passes<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.109> down<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.740> khedira

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
but anyway he passes it down to khedira

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.249 
but anyway he passes it down to khedira
khedira<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.420> keeper<00:02:04.600> saves<00:02:04.899> it<00:02:05.109> i<00:02:05.200> think

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
khedira and the keeper saves it i think

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.050 
khedira and the keeper saves it i think
mike<00:02:05.530> i'm<00:02:05.799> not<00:02:06.009> sure<00:02:06.159> i<00:02:06.430> think<00:02:06.579> might<00:02:06.850> give<00:02:06.969> us

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
mike i'm not sure i think might give us

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.580 
mike i'm not sure i think might give us
like<00:02:07.180> called<00:02:07.390> catalunya<00:02:07.990> or<00:02:08.110> something<00:02:08.470> and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
like called catalunya or something and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.320 
like called catalunya or something and
then<00:02:08.979> Sidney<00:02:09.310> Sam<00:02:09.489> is<00:02:09.640> able<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:09.940> slot<00:02:10.149> that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
then Sidney Sam is able to slot that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.509 
then Sidney Sam is able to slot that
into<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.690> open<00:02:10.929> net<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.069> 90th<00:02:12.430> minute

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.449 
more game and then we will have quite a
few<00:03:04.330> coins<00:03:04.690> from<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.080> division<00:03:05.500> title<00:03:05.890> bonus

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
few coins from the division title bonus

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.789 
few coins from the division title bonus
and<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.239> we<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.840> think<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.470> have<00:03:08.500> eight

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
and so we have I think we have eight

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.500 
and so we have I think we have eight
hundred<00:03:09.069> coins<00:03:09.220> after<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.640> game<00:03:09.819> so<00:03:10.269> we<00:03:10.390> go

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
hundred coins after that game so we go

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.449 
hundred coins after that game so we go
on<00:03:10.630> by<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:11.170> play<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.560> that's<00:03:11.739> guy<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.310> guy

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
on by one play and that's guy that guy

is<00:03:12.519> called<00:03:12.910> Pablo<00:03:13.420> Sarabia<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.170> as<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.799> can

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
is called Pablo Sarabia and as you can

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500 
is called Pablo Sarabia and as you can
see<00:03:14.950> four<00:03:15.280> stories<00:03:15.580> for<00:03:15.700> foster<00:03:16.030> skill<00:03:16.299> moves

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
see four stories for foster skill moves

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.820 
see four stories for foster skill moves
and<00:03:16.720> look<00:03:16.989> at<00:03:17.140> those<00:03:17.230> stats<00:03:17.560> they<00:03:17.709> are

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
and look at those stats they are

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.370 
and look at those stats they are
absolutely<00:03:18.280> phenomenal<00:03:18.549> for<00:03:18.880> 350<00:03:19.870> coins<00:03:20.109> I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
absolutely phenomenal for 350 coins I

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.560 
absolutely phenomenal for 350 coins I
think<00:03:20.829> that's<00:03:20.980> an<00:03:21.070> absolute<00:03:21.400> steal<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.970> you

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
hopefully that's what we're going to do

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.280 
hopefully that's what we're going to do
so<00:03:54.250> next<00:03:54.430> game<00:03:54.730> if<00:03:55.000> we<00:03:55.030> win<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.480> we<00:03:55.600> get<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:56.049> I

so next game if we win it we get like I

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.960 
so next game if we win it we get like I
think<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:56.709> like<00:03:56.829> four<00:03:57.130> or<00:03:57.340> five<00:03:57.370> thousand

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970

think it's like four or five thousand
coins<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.109> you<00:03:59.200> know<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.500> will<00:03:59.650> be<00:03:59.739> an

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
to be able to do it this time I was

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.220 
to be able to do it this time I was
recording<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.489> when<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.700> went<00:04:07.000> in<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.329> you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
recording for when I went in and you

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.050 
recording for when I went in and you
know<00:04:08.350> finding<00:04:09.220> matchmaking<00:04:09.639> it<00:04:09.790> did<00:04:09.940> actually

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
know finding matchmaking it did actually

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.210 
know finding matchmaking it did actually
take<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.450> while<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.840> find<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.170> game<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:12.040> think

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
take a while to find a game and I think

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.800 
take a while to find a game and I think
it<00:04:12.310> took<00:04:12.400> like<00:04:12.549> five<00:04:12.940> or<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.269> minutes<00:04:13.329> so<00:04:13.660> this

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
it took like five or so minutes so this

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.479 
it took like five or so minutes so this
is<00:04:13.930> just<00:04:14.079> sped<00:04:14.380> up<00:04:14.530> like<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.069> fastest

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
is just sped up like the fastest

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.000 
is just sped up like the fastest
possible<00:04:15.639> speeds<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:17.229> know<00:04:17.320> if<00:04:17.620> we

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
possible speeds and you know if we

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.409 
possible speeds and you know if we
eventually<00:04:18.250> found<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.700> game<00:04:18.850> against<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.329> guy

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
eventually found a game against this guy

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.200 
eventually found a game against this guy
