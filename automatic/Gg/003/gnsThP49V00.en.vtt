 Don Cheto was saying to take him 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.729
 to the cabin but no but no no no no 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.740

 please, it's not a bit damp, we're 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.479
 more for that reason when one does it with the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.490
 hands more palpating and you're seeing how 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.000

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.580
 let the meat come out that is quite 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640

 very thick they go to the oven so that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.260
 they are perfectly well cooked 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.390
