00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
repaints of existing action figures they

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
repaints of existing action figures they
didn't<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.650> them<00:00:25.830> randomly<00:00:26.160> apparently

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
didn't just do them randomly apparently

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the story goes that the DNA got mixed up

the story goes that the DNA got mixed up
between<00:00:29.429> various<00:00:29.910> aliens<00:00:30.359> I'll<00:00:30.539> explain<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
between various aliens I'll explain that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
between various aliens I'll explain that
as<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:31.560> along<00:00:31.650> we've<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.640> six<00:00:33.450> eight

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

different figures to show you here that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.060 
different figures to show you here that
are<00:00:35.670> new<00:00:35.850> basically<00:00:36.329> new<00:00:36.510> colors<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.170> existing

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
are new basically new colors on existing

action<00:00:38.219> figures<00:00:38.670> well<00:00:38.879> let's<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> closer

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
action figures well let's have a closer

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
action figures well let's have a closer
look<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.989> here's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> new

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
look so here's a look at the new

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 
look so here's a look at the new
packaging<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> features<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> new<00:00:42.149> sort<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
packaging it features that new sort of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
packaging it features that new sort of
the<00:00:42.809> Benton<00:00:43.350> scanned<00:00:44.270> logo<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> we've<00:00:45.629> seen

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the Benton scanned logo that we've seen

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.229 
the Benton scanned logo that we've seen
already<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.350> year<00:00:46.410> what's<00:00:47.340> new<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.940> put

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
already this year what's new they put

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.100 
already this year what's new they put
the<00:00:48.680> haywire<00:00:49.680> logo<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> front<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.149> they

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the haywire logo on the front and they

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
the haywire logo on the front and they
show<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.590> feature<00:00:52.920> showing<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
show a feature showing you the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
show a feature showing you the
combinations<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.110> DNA<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> happened<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
combinations of DNA that happened the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
combinations of DNA that happened the
swap<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.760> happened<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> create<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.660> color

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
swap that happened to create this color

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
swap that happened to create this color
so<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> Ultraman

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so you see here that Ultraman

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.770 
so you see here that Ultraman
Humongousaur<00:01:00.270> swapped<00:01:01.219> with<00:01:02.219> amphibian<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
Humongousaur swapped with amphibian and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
Humongousaur swapped with amphibian and
so<00:01:03.960> fpv<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.799> ultimate<00:01:05.360> Humongousaur

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so fpv it's got ultimate Humongousaur

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.230 
so fpv it's got ultimate Humongousaur
colors<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> ultimate<00:01:08.610> Humongousaur<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
colors and ultimate Humongousaur is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
colors and ultimate Humongousaur is
going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.600> an<00:01:09.840> phibian<00:01:10.350> colors<00:01:10.650> also

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
going to have an phibian colors also

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.730 
going to have an phibian colors also
these<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.689> mini<00:01:12.990> alien<00:01:13.439> figure

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
these come with this mini alien figure

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
these come with this mini alien figure
this<00:01:13.950> works<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.420> revolution<00:01:16.080> ultra

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this works with the revolution ultra

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.870 
this works with the revolution ultra
matrix<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.310> reviewed<00:01:17.580> yet

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
matrix which we have not reviewed yet

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
matrix which we have not reviewed yet
but<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:18.750> what<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:18.990> mini<00:01:19.259> figures<00:01:19.619> work

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
but that's what these mini figures work

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
but that's what these mini figures work
with<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.490> sort<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> pop<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with they sort of pop out that's the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.100 
with they sort of pop out that's the
feature<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> back

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
feature that they do look at the back

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
feature that they do look at the back
not<00:01:25.110> much<00:01:25.350> new<00:01:25.530> except<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
not much new except this here this is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.039 
not much new except this here this is
called<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.390> QR<00:01:27.750> code<00:01:27.780> quick<00:01:28.470> response<00:01:28.920> code<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
called a QR code quick response code and

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.999 
called a QR code quick response code and
apparently<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.229> scan<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.890> your

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
apparently can scan this with your

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.819 
apparently can scan this with your
iPhone<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.700> similar<00:01:33.090> device<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> unlock

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
iPhone or similar device and unlock
something<00:01:35.130> somewhere<00:01:35.610> you'll<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> try

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
something somewhere you'll have to try

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.760 
something somewhere you'll have to try
that<00:01:36.780> yourself<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.680> an

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that yourself because I don't have an

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.910 
that yourself because I don't have an
iPhone<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:38.220> too<00:01:38.400> cheap<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.210> here's<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> look<00:01:39.720> at

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
iPhone I'm too cheap so here's a look at

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.840 
iPhone I'm too cheap so here's a look at
AP<00:01:40.920> bein<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.340> here's<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> original

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
AP bein and here's the original

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.210 
AP bein and here's the original
amphibian<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.899> mean<00:01:43.350> he<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.500> came<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.009> this

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
amphibian I mean he just came out this

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.410 
amphibian I mean he just came out this
summer<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.670> they've<00:01:44.790> already<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.240> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
summer and they've already got this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.200 
summer and they've already got this
variant<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.649> they're<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.549> pumping<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.030> P

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
variant so they're really pumping in P

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480 
variant so they're really pumping in P
being<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.689> bit<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.619> here's<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
being a little bit and then here's a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
being a little bit and then here's a
well<00:01:51.299> doing<00:01:51.540> Humungousaur<00:01:52.140> sea<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.470> he's<00:01:52.619> got

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
well doing Humungousaur sea and he's got

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
well doing Humungousaur sea and he's got
amphibians<00:01:53.930> colors<00:01:55.430> yeah<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> i<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.270> is

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
amphibians colors yeah and i see this is

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
amphibians colors yeah and i see this is
what<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.600> regular<00:01:57.990> ultimate<00:01:58.860> Humongousaur

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
what the regular ultimate Humongousaur

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.149 
what the regular ultimate Humongousaur
would<00:01:59.579> look<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.829> Humongousaur<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
would look like i think Humongousaur and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.260 
would look like i think Humongousaur and
ultimate<00:02:02.610> Humongousaur<00:02:03.180> must<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> most

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
ultimate Humongousaur must be the most

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
ultimate Humongousaur must be the most
creative<00:02:06.270> action<00:02:06.990> figure<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> bintang

creative action figure in the bintang
line<00:02:08.369> wouldn't<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.879> think<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.270> mean<00:02:09.450> I've<00:02:09.539> got

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
line wouldn't you think I mean I've got

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.140 
line wouldn't you think I mean I've got
tons<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.170> these<00:02:10.289> humongous<00:02:11.250> wars<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.849> various

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
tons of these humongous wars in various

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
tons of these humongous wars in various
forms

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
variant which you're going to have to

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.690 
variant which you're going to have to
collect<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.909> you're<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> fan<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.340> which<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.519> am

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
collect if you're a fan and which I am

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.699 
collect if you're a fan and which I am
of<00:02:19.940> course<00:02:20.239> let's<00:02:21.080> look<00:02:21.230> at<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.440> rest<00:02:21.620> of

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
of course let's look at the rest of

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.280 
of course let's look at the rest of
these<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.099> so<00:02:22.940> here's<00:02:23.150> energy<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.140> can

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
these and so here's energy and you can

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.259 
these and so here's energy and you can
see<00:02:24.409> that<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:25.069> haywire<00:02:25.430> Energy<00:02:25.760> figure<00:02:26.090> he

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
see that the haywire Energy figure he

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.990 
see that the haywire Energy figure he
swapped<00:02:26.659> with<00:02:27.290> ultimate<00:02:28.069> echo<00:02:28.220> echo<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.730> there

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
swapped with ultimate echo echo on there

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.699 
swapped with ultimate echo echo on there
there<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.239> see<00:02:29.269> ultimate<00:02:29.720> echo<00:02:30.290> echo<00:02:30.379> with

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
there you see ultimate echo echo with

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.729 
there you see ultimate echo echo with
Energy's<00:02:31.099> colors<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.750> energy<00:02:33.319> with<00:02:33.500> health

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
Energy's colors and energy with health

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.009 
Energy's colors and energy with health
to<00:02:33.890> me<00:02:33.980> echo<00:02:34.159> echoes<00:02:34.519> colors<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.780> show<00:02:35.959> you

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
to me echo echoes colors and to show you

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.380 
to me echo echoes colors and to show you
for<00:02:36.349> sure<00:02:36.379> here's<00:02:37.370> what<00:02:37.610> energy<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:38.090> supposed

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
for sure here's what energy is supposed

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.860 
for sure here's what energy is supposed
to<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:38.629> like<00:02:38.690> well<00:02:39.140> Lisa's<00:02:39.829> original<00:02:40.280> figure

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
to look like well Lisa's original figure

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.380 
to look like well Lisa's original figure
which<00:02:41.870> came<00:02:42.110> out<00:02:42.230> earlier<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:43.069> year<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
which came out earlier this year and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.479 
which came out earlier this year and
energy<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.959> pretty<00:02:45.140> cool<00:02:45.319> figure<00:02:45.530> we've<00:02:46.310> got

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
energy is a pretty cool figure we've got

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.089 
energy is a pretty cool figure we've got
a<00:02:46.519> deluxe<00:02:47.060> version<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.840> show<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.099> I

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
a deluxe version of this to show you I

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.550 
a deluxe version of this to show you I
like<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:50.000> guy<00:02:50.180> he's<00:02:50.390> kind<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.720> like<00:02:50.930> let's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
like this guy he's kind of like let's

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.839 
like this guy he's kind of like let's
get<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.829> space<00:02:52.129> you<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.430> it's<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.730> energy

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
get this space you on it's the energy

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.390 
get this space you on it's the energy
guy<00:02:53.180> inside<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.810> containment<00:02:54.500> field<00:02:54.920> right<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
guy inside a containment field right and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.149 
guy inside a containment field right and
then<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.359> wonder<00:02:57.109> how<00:02:57.260> he<00:02:57.319> eats<00:02:57.620> when<00:02:58.040> he's

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
then I wonder how he eats when he's

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.979 
then I wonder how he eats when he's
wearing<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.579> but<00:02:58.849> anyway<00:02:59.180> all<00:02:59.390> right<00:02:59.659> then
