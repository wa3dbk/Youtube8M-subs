 I always use them very well never 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.899
 It is important to protect the hair 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 leather by damaging the wires and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.680
 People have a plaque today. I'm going to use it. 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 the chapbin only paralyzed part of the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.809
 front of the hair also we do not know 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.760

 I really like wearing make-up eyes. 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.780
 hairstyles that I think facilitates 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.700
 It leaves very soft with no ends passing in the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.650
 beads and have a smell people series 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.409

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.220
 hair length and let's get the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.159
 hairstyle 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.259
 The first step is to split the hair in the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 I mean, I already wear my hair, I guess. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.130

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.720
 It has elastic and you speak well is beautiful 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.090
 that cocaine was on the head but not 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.380
 Going through the hair, we'll go. 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.820
 leave on top 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 so I'll put it here 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.640
 Yes, I'll pass underneath, I'll leave. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.009
 right here and this volume is not legal 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:18.850
 go straight to make hair look good 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:22.000
 well, take your head and now let's start 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.730
 in putting xavi in the middle of the head I go 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.240
 pick up this average from the front to the fringe 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:34.330
 I will cheer and I will pass under the 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.500
 tyha so and if you do this with 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.060
 all hair 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.790
 now I'm going to get this little bit that 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.010
 passed underneath will instill with another 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 do the same thing 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.930
 twist and slip under the elastic 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.350
 here I will also divide the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.170
 hair in the middle and then I'll teach 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.410
 how do you do this final part that only 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.370
 The last in China, I'll move on. 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.190
 within and continue advancing within 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.440
 all of the hair had to be kept here 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.390
 inside if you need you can 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.970
 put dolphins to ensure 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.370
 better but anyway I'll leave it and 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.160
 Then when we do the other side I 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.450
 I end up together and then the other side the same 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:33.670
 exact thing is very simple just pass 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:35.620
 on the way she did it had good then 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.739
 show with what I'm going to finish is just 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.739
 a matter of rolling down here 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.030
 track had and premium with grampinhos 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.670
 this will also depend a lot on the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 size of your hair is with more hair 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.239
 short is easier so I just go 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.769
 setting here and putting grapples 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.630
 need to put on a hairstyle that way 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.170
