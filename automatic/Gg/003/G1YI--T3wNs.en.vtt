something very different something that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.230 
something very different something that
doesn't<00:01:04.860> follow<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> old<00:01:05.430> templates<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
ocean from place to place on a
tile-based<00:01:37.560> map<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:39.090> also<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
tile-based map and you also do that on a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
tile-based map and you also do that on a
boat<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> walk<00:01:41.280> around<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.610> boat<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
boat so you walk around this boat and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
boat so you walk around this boat and
that<00:01:42.119> feels<00:01:42.390> very<00:01:43.079> mechanical<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.680> doesn't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that feels very mechanical it doesn't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
that feels very mechanical it doesn't
look<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.189> hot<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:46.049> I'm

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
look so hot and as you can see as I'm

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
look so hot and as you can see as I'm
walking<00:01:46.290> around<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.610> looks

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
walking around here just it looks

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
walking around here just it looks
robotic<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.299> looks<00:01:48.479> downright<00:01:48.689> robotic<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
robotic it looks downright robotic and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
robotic it looks downright robotic and
the<00:01:50.009> graphics<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.549> aren't<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> snuff

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the graphics just aren't up to snuff

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.120 
the graphics just aren't up to snuff
with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> underwater<00:01:51.689> world<00:01:52.009> it's<00:01:53.009> not

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
with the underwater world it's not

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
with the underwater world it's not
horrible<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:53.610> any<00:01:53.759> means<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.329> definitely

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
horrible by any means but definitely

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
horrible by any means but definitely
breaks<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.310> immersive

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
breaks from I think a very immersive

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.999 
breaks from I think a very immersive
environment<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.229> experience<00:01:58.799> when

you're swimming once you do dive

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
you're swimming once you do dive
underwater<00:02:01.320> though<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.979> an<00:02:02.130> entirely

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
underwater though it's an entirely

very very impressive game uses i would

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.420 
very very impressive game uses i would
say<00:02:29.720> an<00:02:29.870> adequate<00:02:30.290> control<00:02:30.590> scheme<00:02:30.860> you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
say an adequate control scheme you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.650 
say an adequate control scheme you
basically<00:02:31.640> point<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.209> remote<00:02:32.480> at<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
basically point that we remote at the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.790 
basically point that we remote at the
screen<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.110> dictate<00:02:33.410> where<00:02:33.530> your<00:02:33.650> character

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
screen to dictate where your character

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.100 
screen to dictate where your character
swims<00:02:34.280> it's<00:02:34.910> very<00:02:35.060> intuitive<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.840> easy<00:02:36.020> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
swims it's very intuitive and easy to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.240 
swims it's very intuitive and easy to
pick<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.470> but<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.800> other<00:02:36.890> hand<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.220> don't

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
pick up but on the other hand you don't

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.680 
pick up but on the other hand you don't
really<00:02:37.459> have<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.700> much<00:02:37.910> depth<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.480> what<00:02:38.600> you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
really have that much depth and what you

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.900 
really have that much depth and what you
can<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.980> aren't<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.340> lot<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.790> know

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
can do there aren't a lot of you know

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.240 
can do there aren't a lot of you know
swimming<00:02:41.239> moves<00:02:41.660> let's<00:02:42.110> say<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.190> other

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
swimming moves let's say on the other

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.920 
swimming moves let's say on the other
hand<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.520> can<00:02:43.730> take<00:02:44.000> pictures<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.600> can't<00:02:44.810> use

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
hand you can take pictures you can't use

hand you can take pictures you can't use
an<00:02:45.020> underwater<00:02:45.350> pen<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:46.010> case<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.250> get<00:02:46.340> lost

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
an underwater pen in case you get lost

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.030 
an underwater pen in case you get lost
in<00:02:46.760> environments<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:48.440> can<00:02:48.560> throw<00:02:48.680> food

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
in environments and you can throw food

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.470 
in environments and you can throw food
at<00:02:49.220> fish<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:49.880> forth<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.209> can<00:02:50.300> also

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
at fish and so forth you can also

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.449 
at fish and so forth you can also
interact<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.170> fish<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.770> by<00:02:51.920> rubbing<00:02:52.280> them

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
interact with fish just by rubbing them

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.150 
interact with fish just by rubbing them
and<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:53.750> will<00:02:53.959> help<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.380> catalog<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
and that will help you catalog the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.250 
and that will help you catalog the
animals<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.790> ocean<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.300> do<00:02:56.989> think<00:02:57.230> that

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
animals in the ocean I do think that

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260 
animals in the ocean I do think that
arica<00:02:57.650> missed<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.980> opportunity<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.640> allow

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
arica missed the opportunity to allow

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.270 
arica missed the opportunity to allow
more<00:02:59.480> interaction<00:03:00.110> with<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.470> underwater<00:03:01.040> sea

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
more interaction with the underwater sea

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.100 
more interaction with the underwater sea
life<00:03:01.459> though<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.940> know<00:03:02.360> especially<00:03:02.660> when<00:03:03.020> you

life though you know especially when you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.410 
life though you know especially when you
