00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.839
 Peter you have to do a lot of puzzling to that 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.700
 two boys were suspended, we assumed 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 this time some discussions are about 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.280
 overall it is pretty fixed what we 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.990
 but now had something 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.770
 nice puzzling and why was it now 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 other than after other times because we 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.369
 within our current selection or the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.019
 Options have to replace guys 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.420
 therefore looked 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.199
 hold on to a football and the player 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 in the back line eventually 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.110
 how is your fatness with the others 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.950
 boys and two suspended mistresses too 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 Fat 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.510
 yes the rest can all play kelvin 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.700
 leerdam has them again last Monday 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.040
 first minutes made with the promises 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.360
 how did he fare 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.039
 that went well of course if you 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 have not played for five weeks then 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.550
 you notice the rhythm of course anyway 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.440
 something disrupting is five weeks of snakes 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 don't play football for a soccer player 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.760
 no play games but god has 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.289
 that can complete 90 minutes 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.820
 and that is why I am already with him again 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.379
 know your selection suit you're the only one 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.449
 been absent for weeks due to a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.360
 injury how are you 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.010
 is going to be lucky better i add one 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 also plug it back to him not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.580
 since a week and a half so don't go yet 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.049
 can do 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.119
 last Monday you have first minutes 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.479
 again when the promises how you went 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.880
 Which 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.159
 without pain so I fell it takes 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.970
 without a back pain 4 more will come 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.820
 lost 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 for me personally problem was there 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.590
 almost five weeks may again westrijd 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 so play personally from those it thought 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.970
 I'm fine 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.770
 I now almost have left behind 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.479
 things taken with the first team plus 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.189
 and wisdom played so 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.290
 and I have not had any response yet 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.899
 bad no bad signs of mine 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.060
 body so that it is there what i have 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.000
 that I can physically do everything with it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.979
 medical jews take back to the tram 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 what will happen tomorrow then 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.340
 briefly about the it means of 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.930
 groningen it is a team that manages to 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 low is given qualities that they 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 him well what strikes me is if you have one 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.049
 groningen look the difference from before the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 winter break and after the winter break 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.780
 and I ca n't impress myself 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.950
 tap their field where they have 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 we only have to play once and and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.770
 then have to be gone now every 14 days 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.959
 play that is not to their advantage 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.550
 want to have football this season 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.500
 well played football also very start of 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.849
 If you season it is a very bad one 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.980
 turf must do and they have it there 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.170
 Meanwhile then than it is not easy 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.489
 the field in groningen is bad for you 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.590
 are also a soccer team 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.590
 you also have the annoyance of we there 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.510
 also in the van fame the self-unknown 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.769
 recognize when the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.480
 we now have to play football and when not 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.400
 we are happy with difficulty and 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.019
 hasbro penders 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.290
 if not if not if playing football is not possible 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.660
 we can try with contrary to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.370
 fight that he was winning and and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.010
 Of course our people go is there a football 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.269
 box and there is just pulling towards us 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.769
 as have slain with her when a 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.120
 Battlefield and just look for Mikey and on 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.160
 try to go to the second butter football 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.359
 and so when you see how the organs we 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.060
 may not have been on the field 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.799
 all that bad and looks've been 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.900
 look so bad on TV that it really does 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.680
 is me and we will see it we have to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.930
 just try to deal with it 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.799
 circumstances and you can see that 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.799
 what comes out of it
