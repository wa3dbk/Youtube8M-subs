yo alien I'm bodybuilding for 3 years I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.490 
yo alien I'm bodybuilding for 3 years I
noticed<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.029> dropping<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.600> gains<00:00:22.050> but

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
noticed that dropping my gains but

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.040 
noticed that dropping my gains but
there's<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> guy<00:00:23.010> at<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> gym<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:24.060> flexes<00:00:24.869> in

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
there's a guy at the gym that flexes in

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
there's a guy at the gym that flexes in
front<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> mirror<00:00:26.000> all<00:00:27.000> day<00:00:27.060> long<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:30.330> I

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
front of the mirror all day long and I

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
front of the mirror all day long and I
asked<00:00:30.750> myself<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.650> any<00:00:31.890> benefit<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
asked myself is there any benefit to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.990 
asked myself is there any benefit to
contracting<00:00:33.390> these<00:00:33.540> muscles<00:00:34.790> during<00:00:35.790> my

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
contracting these muscles during my

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.560 
contracting these muscles during my
workout<00:00:36.450> past<00:00:37.320> couple<00:00:37.500> months<00:00:38.210> I've<00:00:39.210> taken<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
workout past couple months I've taken a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.310 
workout past couple months I've taken a
time<00:00:39.780> about<00:00:40.020> 30<00:00:40.350> seconds<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.719> flex<00:00:42.719> my

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
time about 30 seconds and flex my

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.310 
time about 30 seconds and flex my
muscles<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.250> between<00:00:44.760> sets<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.899> changed

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
muscles in between sets have not changed

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
muscles in between sets have not changed
my<00:00:46.440> workout<00:00:46.800> routine<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.399> all<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.570> I'm

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
my workout routine at all but I'm

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.880 
my workout routine at all but I'm
definitely<00:00:49.230> seeing<00:00:49.530> gains<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:51.890> gain

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
definitely seeing gains a gain

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.779 
definitely seeing gains a gain
noticeable<00:00:53.550> mass<00:00:54.500> my<00:00:55.500> question<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.250> does

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
noticeable mass my question is does

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.510 
noticeable mass my question is does
flexing<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.449> between<00:00:57.750> sets<00:00:58.020> add<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:59.190> under

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
flexing in between sets add time under

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
flexing in between sets add time under
tension<00:00:59.550> for<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> muscles<00:01:00.570> almost<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
tension for the muscles almost like a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.460 
tension for the muscles almost like a
drop<00:01:02.250> set<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:05.630> you're<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.750> asking<00:01:06.990> me<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.350> it's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
drop set so you're not asking me if it's

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.859 
drop set so you're not asking me if it's
effective<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.310> clearly<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:09.570> seeing

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
effective because clearly you're seeing

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.710 
effective because clearly you're seeing
the<00:01:10.020> gains<00:01:10.290> right

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
the gains right

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.000 
the gains right
one<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> things<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> often<00:01:13.560> talk

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
one of the things that I often talk

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.429 
one of the things that I often talk
about<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.729> how<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> nervous<00:01:15.930> system<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:17.150> the

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
about is how the nervous system is the

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.810 
about is how the nervous system is the
foundation<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.799> functionality<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
foundation the functionality of your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
foundation the functionality of your
nervous<00:01:21.299> system<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> foundation<00:01:22.560> for

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
nervous system is the foundation for

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
nervous system is the foundation for
your<00:01:22.890> strength<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.119> muscular

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
your strength for your muscular

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.109 
your strength for your muscular
performance<00:01:25.280> when<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.430> take<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
performance when you take the time to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.480 
performance when you take the time to
flex<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:27.930> muscles<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> said

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
flex your muscles like you like you said

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.819 
flex your muscles like you like you said
you're<00:01:29.700> doing<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:31.140> Drive<00:01:31.560> you're

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you're doing right your Drive you're

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
you're doing right your Drive you're
taking<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.189> nervous<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.820> central

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
taking you're nervous that your central

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.480 
taking you're nervous that your central
nervous<00:01:33.240> system<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.290> driving<00:01:35.250> energy

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
nervous system and your driving energy

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.270 
nervous system and your driving energy
out<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.570> periphery<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.890> into<00:01:38.189> your

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
out into the periphery out into your

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.819 
out into the periphery out into your
muscles<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.380> you're<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
muscles right so what you're doing is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.950 
muscles right so what you're doing is
you're<00:01:40.979> create<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.549> greasing<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.509> groove

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're create your greasing the groove

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
you're create your greasing the groove
in<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.590> Pawel<00:01:44.220> would<00:01:44.340> call<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.090> lot

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
in a way Pawel would call it that a lot

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
in a way Pawel would call it that a lot
of<00:01:45.329> good<00:01:45.530> read<00:01:46.530> some<00:01:46.740> stuff<00:01:46.950> by<00:01:47.100> pavol<00:01:47.430> because

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
of good read some stuff by pavol because

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.350 
of good read some stuff by pavol because
what<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> describe<00:01:50.000> he<00:01:51.000> talks

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
what I'm about to describe he talks

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.460 
what I'm about to describe he talks
about<00:01:51.540> quite<00:01:51.990> often<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:53.640> basically<00:01:54.470> driving

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
about quite often it's basically driving

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.789 
about quite often it's basically driving
more<00:01:56.100> energy<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:57.570> muscle<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.200> what

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
more energy into your muscle and what

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.399 
more energy into your muscle and what
that<00:01:58.979> does<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.670> through<00:02:00.090> repetition<00:02:00.409> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
that does is through repetition it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.300 
that does is through repetition it
reduces<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> viscosity<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.479> reduces<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
reduces the viscosity it reduces the

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.219 
reduces the viscosity it reduces the
if<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.330> guys<00:02:07.480> are<00:02:07.690> don't<00:02:07.810> understand<00:02:08.140> the

if you guys are don't understand the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.250 
if you guys are don't understand the
word<00:02:08.380> viscosity<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.490> friction<00:02:10.210> right<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
nervous system and your muscle so the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.390 
nervous system and your muscle so the
more<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.750> do<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:17.440> energy<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
more you do it the more energy and the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.200 
more you do it the more energy and the
faster<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.060> easier<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:20.080> nervous<00:02:20.500> energy

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
faster and easier that nervous energy

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.050 
faster and easier that nervous energy
goes<00:02:22.210> into<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> muscle<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.250> that's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
goes into the muscle right and that's

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.130 
goes into the muscle right and that's
