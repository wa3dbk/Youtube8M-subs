00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.849
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 Yaroslav bool1 and today we have an unusual 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 here is dad for 1c 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.990
 or just the keyhole we are all fine 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 we know that the higher the tank level 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.000
 harder to play you need to think already 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.010
 where to punch how best to go which 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 tactics better to apply and whether to drag 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 your team is all that interesting of course 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 but after tens of thousands of battles 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.170
 sometimes it bothers me from such 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 routine truth saves 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.840
 command and company battle but there is another 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.930
 great way to have fun namely 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 itâ€™s not easy to return to the sandbox 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.899
 so well on specific tanks and one of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.940
 such 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 this is the keyway just think about it 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.710
 characteristics of its maximum speed 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.230
 is seventy nine kilometers in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.320
 hour and chassis turning speed 48 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.840
 degrees per second armor of our tank 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.719
 is 30 millimeters in the forehead and 20 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 millimeters god and feed and at the tower 30 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.299
 millimeters forehead and 14 millimeters of god 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 and for a viewing distance of 340 meters and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.650
 radio station range 700 meters but it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.780
 all nonsense 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.850
 in fact the most important thing is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.700
 of this tank this speed is his gun 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.280
 bend over to the dishes of our tank 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.860
 machine gun with magazine loading system 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.409
 5 magazines in one store each 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 a network of 8 shells each shell deals 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.259
 8-10 damga total with one store 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.229
 we can deal above 200 damage 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 which is more than enough to kill almost 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.420
 any tank at his level this tank 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.939
 real death machine that punishes 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 just all serious guys 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.990
 there are really very few such tanks 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.950
 because they bring real charge 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.350
 positive 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.020
 well, in the meantime, as you can see I broke through 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.689
 flank itself and go already to the base to the enemy 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.270
 where the real massacre will start 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.270
 and if you want to play this 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.469
 tank remember one rule not 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.820
 stay seriously in no way 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.009
 case your tank should not 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.410
 stop if you fly to the crowd 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.390
 enemies you have to twist them circling and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.850
 Now I will be engaged in just such 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.520
 action and so against me now stands 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.920
 one art and 2n actually told 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.200
 bad but due to the dynamics I start 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.180
 famously spin the first pack and try 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.750
 kill her but as you can see I ran out 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.370
 cartridges 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.319
 opera means is 7 seconds 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.730
 so you just need to tough it out 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.230
 slightly more load the opponent into 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.640
 back side so that according to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.620
 could shoot at t and u me this 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.840
 really, in principle, I get to 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 last try to spin and wait 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.730
 one more recharge here already attends 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.770
 t18 but he did not take into account one thing that he 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.600
 I had to shoot it earlier as the notches 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.940
 I still die for two stores 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.280
 to finish off the second pt there is one more 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.350
 art which is not known where it comes from 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.239
 one more bun I make a mistake with me 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.220
 recharge all seconds I very much 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.000
 I hope that T18 miss it and so 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 happens 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.420
 temporary thinking was just not so 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.060
 that I flew to ram now mine 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.800
 vision drops near ltp i am 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.320
 I can shoot more or less normally 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.480
 distances up to 300 meters after already my 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.489
 bullets can simply not even reach but 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 this time the distance is good and ours 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.989
 the guy goes to the hangar as a result 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.299
 all remains for all 2 aspiring tanks and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.920
 i start flying them thanks to my 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.920
 crazy dynamics and no problem 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.880
 I twist the British after which it boldly 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.400
 sending wang 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.090
 of course you now say blow dates to 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.239
 goldie 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.910
 needless guys but actually this 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.850
 tank drags without gold and to prove 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.739
 I will show you one more fight this 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.930
 time i'm going to play cocked with my 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.140
 three friends 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.079
 Believe me, better 1 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.600
 Three lashes Judge for yourself all for all 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.290
 few seconds we shoot 120 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.360
 shells I mean almost as many as 600 units 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.750
 potential damage and the most important thing is that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.030
 it is wildly fun and no tank in the world 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.760
 you will not be able to bring so much joy and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.250
 positive believe me actually i 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.829
 long loved these tanks and just 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.450
 adored playing on the firefly particular this 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.120
 was my favorite q 52 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.940
 Well, unfortunately it was removed such tanks 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.340
 they give just crazy dynamics and give 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.410
 the opportunity to have fun is not necessary 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.169
 think where to break the enemy here 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.600
 the main thing is fun speed and fast 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.060
 zalet but this tank has 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.730
 one such big minus namely 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.250
 his balance quite often can you 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.800
 throw in the fifth level that will be in 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.720
 principle hurt you can't bend 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.240
 but if you try it there 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.310
 deliver to several opponents 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.950
 trouble though 7 frags and not stuffed 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.080
 it is also worth recalling modules yes guys 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.300
 if you buy this tank then be 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.180
 ready to spend a little and on the module 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.740
 believe me it is worth it you are more correct 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.680
 want it yourself 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.690
 the list of modules we have is small and I would give you 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.290
 recommended such as enlightened 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.510
 optics 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.590
 ventilation and enhanced aiming drives 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.330
 the gear is absolutely standard 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.760
 repair kit first aid kit and fire extinguisher 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.040
 although the place of the fire extinguisher can be put 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.880
 of course or act new gasoline or 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.820
 chocolate bar 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.040
 but the truth is the fire extinguisher is also not 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.910
 it will be superfluous and this is the situation for you 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.370
 I'll prove it now 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.290
 we go in for two 1 we manage 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.750
 finish the second pataya manages to do 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.490
 shot and set fire to me good in this 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.120
 The moment I had was automatic 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.250
 fire extinguisher 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.410
 it really saved my life so much 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.140
 that the 3 module is still better to 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.450
 it was he who spoke though of course this is the case 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.850
 your battle is starting to sound like 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.730
 end and I would like to summarize 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.680
 the pros and cons of this tank with the pros I 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.080
 I can say a crazy speed and 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.110
 the dynamics are serious guys this is very and 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.390
 very cheerful and jovial tank also 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.430
 a huge plus is our machine gun 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.470
 seriously he is just great but to 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.110
 Unfortunately, not able to break through all the tanks 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.000
 for example this them them with 38 can break through 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.670
 at best gold and only in his 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.530
 karma minutes this tank only one 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.870
 namely, that it can be balancing 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.630
 fifth level seriously there you will be 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.700
 hard but if you think a little bit there 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.340
 you have a chance to also make quite 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.620
 a good fight on the map is what 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.570
 I think it would be nice to take and mx 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.450
 38 but unexpected machine-gun fire 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.940
 I was convinced from behind of this once because 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.730
 you can pick another but podi-ka 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.040
 no i won't get it on the same all with you 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.140
 I was Yaroslav lighting 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.830
 channel put your fingers up and see you soon 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.820
 meeting 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.820
 Dear friends
