00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 

I<00:01:02.750> was<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:03.899> lucky<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.860> family<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I was very lucky to have a family that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.580 
I was very lucky to have a family that
was<00:01:05.550> very<00:01:05.580> supportive<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.690> dreams<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.260> think

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
was very supportive of my dreams I think

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.050 
was very supportive of my dreams I think
it's<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:07.890> important<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.580> people<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> have

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it's really important for people to have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
it's really important for people to have
those<00:01:09.150> people<00:01:09.479> around<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> same

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
those people around them but at the same

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
those people around them but at the same
time<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.250> everybody<00:01:11.700> does<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> doesn't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
time not everybody does and it doesn't

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
time not everybody does and it doesn't
mean<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.680> can't<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.580> all

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
mean that we can't make it really all

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.320 
mean that we can't make it really all
that<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.020> takes<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:17.280> own<00:01:17.400> inner

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that all that it takes is your own inner

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:35.500 
that all that it takes is your own inner
strength<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.960> own<00:01:19.050> will

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.140 

this<00:01:36.510> one<00:01:36.690> resonates<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.710> me<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.820> same<00:01:39.000> way

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
this one resonates with me the same way

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.310 
this one resonates with me the same way
I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> resonate<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
I think it was a resonate with a lot of

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.740 
I think it was a resonate with a lot of
people<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.800> it's<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:41.670> finding<00:01:42.300> inner

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
people in that it's about finding inner

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.140 
people in that it's about finding inner
strength<00:01:43.080> often<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:44.490> feel<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
strength often you know when you feel a

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.350 
strength often you know when you feel a
little<00:01:46.020> loss<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.410> week<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.740> turn<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.040> music<00:01:47.360> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
little loss or week you turn to music to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
little loss or week you turn to music to
give<00:01:48.540> me<00:01:48.600> strength<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.140> sing<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.650> song<00:01:50.430> like
