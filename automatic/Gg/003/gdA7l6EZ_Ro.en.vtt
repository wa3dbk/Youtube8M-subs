00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.250
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.360
 in this time 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.990
 I'm sorry, my third video tutorial 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 subtraction of binary numbers 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.230
 percent and they are arresting a minority 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.869
 the cast subtracts the binary system the same that explains neighborhood 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.550
 but it is convenient to review the operation of subtracting sibal to understand the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.779
 binary pressure 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.589
 what more simple 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.069
 the star that pulls the recession to my time suffer two diligences 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.699
 but 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.660
 the fundamental rules 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 so that the president will go well are the following 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 he deserves it is equal to zero 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.690
 1 - xerez equaled one 1-1 is equal to zero and will be hard is equal 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.740
 to ten but in your case 1 real city is available on 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.870
 the chatÃ³n srz resume 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.110
 what bad messi would be 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.020
 2 - an unusual yet 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.979
 the straight 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.050
 0- world book 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.430
 same as in the decimal system taking neither to lend to the next position 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760
 0-1 jerky abounded 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.420
 and the goal came 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.170
 which is to say that in this month and Marseille 2-1 is equal to 1 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.330
 for example 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 1-0 is equal to 1-municipal to 0 0 - municipal to 1 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 bring attire 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.480
 one municipal to zero and zero - a small meager 1 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 1-0 is equal steel 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 will be the only one that I abounded 1 1 1 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 the result is rumba and that overflows by left 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.020
 but as there is less mayor it can not be a long ended in 2 the country hour in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.490
 which depreciates 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.870
 as examples 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.310
 with table 1-1 is equal steel 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 and clarified p 1 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.449
 so 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.920
 then we have been the relationship 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.410
 one in the municipal one said 0-2 min equal deepened 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.459
 i 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.709
 is equal to zero 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 Companies 1-0 is equal steel 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.599
 we have three team members tournament 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.849
 1 - xerez equal abounded 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.709
 0-1 is equal to 1 carrying one 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 1-1 that equaled zero and zero - the equal to zero 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.079
 1-0 is equal to one 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.499
 1-1 equal zeros n-1 equal to one carrying one 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.549
 here ain an imaginary 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.739
 1-1 1-0 were on board world equal to zero 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.439
 so 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.689
 then here 1-0 be equal ascer 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.969
 colon 0-1 when one one one one can do 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.269
 a man forced to close will be with fervor steels at least one equal 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.549
 and some at least one equal to zero and zero must equal zero 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.889
 then here 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:29.030
 1-0 equal to 1 0-municipal abounded and abounded 1-1 equal to zero and 0-0 equal to 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.009
 zero 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:36.749
 one of the seven flights 1 1-1 equal to zero 0-1 equal to 1 million 1 1 - r 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.609
 equal 1-1 equal to zero 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.649
 1-0 same said 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.259
 1-1 equal steel 0- equal zero 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.450
 at least not which abounded none 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.829
 1-1 equal 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.429
 cemented 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:52.389
 but 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.109
 because the confusion 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.549
 because sometimes 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.409
 we do not forget what to bring 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.739
 today to carry in this case that would be the proper term to bring the tel 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.269
 one that we carry 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.739
 also assume that the straight smells like four operations like 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.989
 multiplication 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.929
 we can not forget about what we are carrying or, where appropriate, what 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.469
 we're 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.219
 what we are 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.699
 subtracting adding all pressure 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.169
 for example here 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.310
 good sea as excommunication 1-1 equal to zero 0-1 equal 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.059
 and it takes 1 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:30.639
 July 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.569
 here is an imaginary 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:34.700
 - 0 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.700
 It does not matter 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.219
 and point 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.080
 this result here is the result because 1-0 equal pointed to whom 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.870
 result here in an imaginary 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.340
 in such a sense 1-1 same asserted 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.560
 then if a good price a domain is going to be equal to do 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.979
 so 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.240
 but that the laying 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 predict long mitchell and already expected to understand 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.009
 live but the future to be a minority because I was going outside 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.789
 pere costs change users 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.819
 appreciate my 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.420
 miep and work victims was or not 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.520
 In the future, it can help you too. Thank you very much. My name is 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.700
