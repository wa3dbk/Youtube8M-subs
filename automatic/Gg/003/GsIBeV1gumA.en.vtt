ulcers<00:00:09.920> first<00:00:10.920> we<00:00:11.099> need<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> identify<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
ulcers first we need to identify the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.240 
ulcers first we need to identify the
agent<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.280> make<00:00:15.139> stain<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.650> material

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
agent so we can make stain of a material

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.300 
agent so we can make stain of a material
collected<00:00:18.029> from<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.660> base<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.410> ulcer<00:00:19.830> we

collected from the base of the ulcer we

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.730 
collected from the base of the ulcer we
use<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> fine<00:00:20.939> needle<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.840> collect<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.439> the

stain it directly or we can culture it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.120 
stain it directly or we can culture it
and<00:00:28.609> see<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.060> sensitivity<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.410> organism

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
and the answer base this will form a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.260 
and the answer base this will form a
pseudo<00:02:30.950> tritium<00:02:33.130> here<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.520> section<00:02:35.060> of

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
pseudo tritium here that the section of

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.320 
pseudo tritium here that the section of
the<00:02:35.390> conjunctival<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.530> then<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.790> suture

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
the conjunctival and then it is suture

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.570 
the conjunctival and then it is suture
to<00:02:38.540> cover<00:02:38.810> part<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.860> whole<00:02:39.890> cornea

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
to cover part or the whole cornea

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.500 
to cover part or the whole cornea
depending<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.540> extent<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.320> answer

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
depending on the extent of the answer

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.270 
depending on the extent of the answer
sometimes<00:02:44.510> there<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.020> no<00:02:45.260> response<00:02:45.740> then<00:02:46.100> we

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
sometimes there is no response then we

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.570 
sometimes there is no response then we
can<00:02:46.490> do<00:02:46.790> charata<00:02:47.300> plus<00:02:47.570> T<00:02:47.840> Encarta<00:02:48.740> plus<00:02:49.010> T<00:02:49.340> we

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
can do charata plus T Encarta plus T we

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.120 
can do charata plus T Encarta plus T we
take<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.090> cornea<00:02:50.660> with<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.140> its<00:02:51.410> infections

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
take the cornea with all its infections

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.340 
take the cornea with all its infections
out<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.790> even<00:02:53.209> we<00:02:53.360> can<00:02:53.570> wash<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.990> antechamber

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
out and even we can wash the antechamber

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.490 
out and even we can wash the antechamber
every<00:02:55.220> type<00:02:55.550> option<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.300> AC<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:57.290> we'll

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
every type option and the AC then we'll

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.210 
every type option and the AC then we'll
put<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.740> new<00:02:58.070> cornea<00:02:59.260> therapeutic<00:03:00.260> because<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
put a new cornea therapeutic because the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.480 
put a new cornea therapeutic because the
goal<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:02.000> clear<00:03:02.300> up<00:03:02.480> infection<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:03.950> doing

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
goal is to clear up infection but doing

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.940 
goal is to clear up infection but doing
kurata<00:03:05.270> velocity<00:03:05.959> at<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.470> time<00:03:06.740> of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
kurata velocity at the time of

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.160 
kurata velocity at the time of
inflammation<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> very<00:03:08.510> high<00:03:08.810> risk

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
inflammation there is a very high risk

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.970 
inflammation there is a very high risk
of<00:03:09.440> getting<00:03:10.340> into<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.780> raft<00:03:11.959> rejection<00:03:12.470> so

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
of getting into the raft rejection so

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.520 
of getting into the raft rejection so
our<00:03:13.190> goal<00:03:13.550> here<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:13.910> mainly<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:15.080> get<00:03:15.260> rid<00:03:15.500> of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
our goal here is mainly to get rid of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.770 
our goal here is mainly to get rid of
the<00:03:15.830> infection<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.550> if<00:03:17.090> there<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.420> graft

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the infection and if there is graft

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.620 
the infection and if there is graft
rejection<00:03:17.959> we<00:03:18.500> can<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.459> plus<00:03:19.880> t<00:03:20.180> another

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
rejection we can do that plus t another

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.320 
rejection we can do that plus t another
one<00:03:20.930> later<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:22.070> if<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.430> patient<00:03:22.820> is<00:03:22.940> lucky

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
one later but if the patient is lucky

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.720 
one later but if the patient is lucky
enough<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.870> graft<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.530> not<00:03:24.830> rejected<00:03:25.430> then

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
enough the graft is not rejected then

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.820 
enough the graft is not rejected then
this<00:03:26.120> graft<00:03:26.450> applause<00:03:26.780> he<00:03:26.989> can<00:03:27.200> beat<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.440> man

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
this graft applause he can beat the man

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.810 
this graft applause he can beat the man
therapeutic<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:28.760> optical<00:03:29.480> at<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> same<00:03:30.080> time

therapeutic and optical at the same time

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.570 
therapeutic and optical at the same time
this<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:32.840> be<00:03:33.019> will<00:03:33.320> be<00:03:33.500> covered<00:03:33.890> later<00:03:34.130> when

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
this can be will be covered later when

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.160 
this can be will be covered later when
we<00:03:34.730> talk<00:03:34.970> about<00:03:35.000> correct<00:03:35.690> applause<00:03:35.989> thank<00:03:36.980> you
