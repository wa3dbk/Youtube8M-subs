must have dropped my xbox 360 controller
by<00:00:27.230> accident<00:00:27.950> and<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.430> noticed<00:00:28.970> on<00:00:29.330> the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
by accident and I noticed on the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.189 
by accident and I noticed on the
underneath<00:00:30.530> section<00:00:30.980> there<00:00:31.940> are<00:00:31.970> two<00:00:32.329> small

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
underneath section there are two small

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.700 
underneath section there are two small
hairline<00:00:33.530> cracks<00:00:34.160> located<00:00:35.030> on<00:00:35.239> each<00:00:35.600> side<00:00:36.140> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
hairline cracks located on each side and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.279 
hairline cracks located on each side and
I<00:00:36.920> thought<00:00:37.069> to<00:00:37.190> myself<00:00:37.510> it<00:00:38.510> must<00:00:39.079> have

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
I thought to myself it must have

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.590 
I thought to myself it must have
happened<00:00:39.440> when<00:00:39.769> it<00:00:40.100> hit<00:00:40.429> a<00:00:40.460> hard<00:00:40.729> surface<00:00:41.359> and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
happened when it hit a hard surface and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.360 
happened when it hit a hard surface and
I<00:00:42.050> thought<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:42.949> believe<00:00:43.219> this

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
I thought and I believe this

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.110 
I thought and I believe this
happened<00:00:43.640> but<00:00:45.280> there<00:00:46.280> hasn't<00:00:46.429> been<00:00:46.640> much

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
happened but there hasn't been much

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.689 
happened but there hasn't been much
damaged<00:00:47.659> caused<00:00:48.019> I<00:00:48.229> mean<00:00:48.409> if<00:00:48.499> you<00:00:48.620> lean<00:00:49.309> on<00:00:49.519> it

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
damaged caused I mean if you lean on it

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.110 
damaged caused I mean if you lean on it
it<00:00:49.940> will<00:00:50.589> it's<00:00:51.589> good<00:00:51.769> bit<00:00:51.859> flimsy<00:00:52.399> but<00:00:52.609> it

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
it will it's good bit flimsy but it

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.149 
it will it's good bit flimsy but it
doesn't<00:00:53.539> really<00:00:53.629> matter<00:00:53.839> because<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.469> actually

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
doesn't really matter because I actually

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.669 
doesn't really matter because I actually
found<00:00:55.609> a<00:00:55.909> fix<00:00:56.239> for<00:00:56.659> it<00:00:56.839> basically<00:00:59.139> for<00:01:00.139> example

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
found a fix for it basically for example

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.860 
found a fix for it basically for example
we're<00:01:00.889> going<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:01.129> pop<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.670> battery<00:01:02.059> back<00:01:02.389> in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.550 

like<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:07.700> what<00:01:07.850> I've<00:01:07.969> done<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
like so and what I've done is the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.929 
like so and what I've done is the
elastic<00:01:10.219> band<00:01:10.780> method<00:01:11.890> as<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.070> can<00:01:13.310> see<00:01:13.490> i've

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
elastic band method as you can see i've

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.679 
elastic band method as you can see i've
got<00:01:14.000> two<00:01:14.360> elastic<00:01:14.990> bands<00:01:15.850> double-ended<00:01:16.909> for<00:01:17.659> a

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
got two elastic bands double-ended for a

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.039 
got two elastic bands double-ended for a
tighter<00:01:18.649> grip<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.399> what<00:01:20.299> I've<00:01:20.420> done<00:01:20.659> are<00:01:20.899> we

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
tighter grip and what I've done are we

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.319 
tighter grip and what I've done are we
wrapped<00:01:21.320> two<00:01:21.829> elastic<00:01:22.340> bands<00:01:22.609> around<00:01:23.619> the

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
wrapped two elastic bands around the

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.440 
wrapped two elastic bands around the
gray<00:01:26.329> section<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.039> actual<00:01:28.399> Xbox<00:01:28.880> 360

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
gray section of the actual Xbox 360

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.959 
gray section of the actual Xbox 360
controller<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:32.229> basically<00:01:33.229> what<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.189> does<00:01:34.219> it

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
controller and basically what it does it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.980 
controller and basically what it does it
will<00:01:35.740> tighten<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.159> bottom<00:01:37.579> section<00:01:38.060> folding

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
will tighten the bottom section folding

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.340 
will tighten the bottom section folding
it<00:01:39.079> up<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.460> battery<00:01:40.850> can<00:01:41.210> be<00:01:41.899> more

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
it up so that the battery can be more

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.789 
it up so that the battery can be more
tighter<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.670> compact<00:01:44.270> within<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.350> Xbox<00:01:45.649> Live

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
tighter and compact within the Xbox Live

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.510 
tighter and compact within the Xbox Live
system<00:01:46.009> controller<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:48.219> well<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.399> only

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
system controller and well the only

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.599 
system controller and well the only
reason<00:01:49.609> I<00:01:49.999> done<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.649> was<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.829> basically<00:01:52.189> fix

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
reason I done it was to basically fix

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.849 
reason I done it was to basically fix
this<00:01:52.969> little<00:01:53.179> problem<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.049> two<00:01:54.229> cracks<00:01:54.560> you

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
this little problem the two cracks you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.830 
this little problem the two cracks you
can't<00:01:55.070> really<00:01:55.340> see<00:01:55.609> it<00:01:55.700> on<00:01:55.789> my<00:01:55.939> camp<00:01:56.270> because

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
can't really see it on my camp because

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.709 
can't really see it on my camp because
it<00:01:56.869> doesn't<00:01:57.170> go<00:01:57.289> at<00:01:57.409> focus<00:01:57.819> unfortunately<00:01:58.819> but

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
it doesn't go at focus unfortunately but

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.149 
it doesn't go at focus unfortunately but
I<00:01:59.780> mean<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.200> long<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.560> don't<00:02:00.710> mess<00:02:01.100> with

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
I mean as long as you don't mess with

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.550 
I mean as long as you don't mess with
the<00:02:01.609> elastic<00:02:02.030> bands<00:02:02.270> they<00:02:02.780> won't<00:02:03.049> move<00:02:03.229> that's

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
the elastic bands they won't move that's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.889 
the elastic bands they won't move that's
pretty<00:02:03.799> much<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.159> but<00:02:05.030> what<00:02:05.179> I<00:02:05.210> was<00:02:05.479> able<00:02:05.869> to

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
pretty much it but what I was able to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.669 
pretty much it but what I was able to
notice<00:02:06.249> was<00:02:07.479> earlier<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.750> when<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.259> was<00:02:09.470> playing

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
notice was earlier on when I was playing

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.770 
notice was earlier on when I was playing
Minecraft<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:10.700> my<00:02:11.170> xbox<00:02:12.170> 360<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:14.120> battery

life
actually<00:02:18.010> was<00:02:19.010> lasting<00:02:19.640> longer<00:02:19.909> than<00:02:20.450> what<00:02:20.599> it

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
actually was lasting longer than what it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.360 
actually was lasting longer than what it

noticed was simple it only went down by

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.309 
noticed was simple it only went down by
one<00:02:50.900> bar<00:02:51.109> and<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.970> currently<00:02:53.319> actually

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
one bar and it's currently actually

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.530 
one bar and it's currently actually
still<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.890> percentage<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.269> light

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
still on that percentage so the light

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.839 
still on that percentage so the light
has<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:57.140> yet<00:02:57.319> been<00:02:57.500> flickering<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.810> reckon

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
has not yet been flickering so I reckon

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.500 
has not yet been flickering so I reckon
the<00:03:01.849> elastic<00:03:02.329> bands<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.500> actually<00:03:04.239> not<00:03:05.239> only

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
the elastic bands have actually not only

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.430 
the elastic bands have actually not only
fixed<00:03:06.379> my<00:03:06.650> problem<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:07.760> also<00:03:08.440> increased

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
fixed my problem but also increased

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.420 
fixed my problem but also increased
battery<00:03:10.129> life<00:03:10.549> for<00:03:10.970> longer<00:03:11.629> use<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:13.220> can

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
battery life for longer use you can

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.140 
battery life for longer use you can
argue<00:03:13.670> with<00:03:13.940> that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
argue with that

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.210 
argue with that
I<00:03:14.299> mean<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.599> you<00:03:14.690> can<00:03:14.870> work<00:03:15.019> for<00:03:15.290> me<00:03:15.349> you<00:03:16.040> can

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
I mean if you can work for me you can

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.949 
I mean if you can work for me you can
work<00:03:16.370> for<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:17.409> so<00:03:18.409> yeah<00:03:19.129> if<00:03:19.669> you<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.120> wear
