00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
hop out and actually fall off let me

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.370 
hop out and actually fall off let me
show<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:36.200> folds<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:38.280> comes<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.729> see

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
show you this folds up it comes out see

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.480 
show you this folds up it comes out see
there<00:01:40.380> stick<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.400> um<00:01:42.200> like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
there stick to this um like

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.690 
there stick to this um like
plastic<00:01:45.490> boards<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:45.970> guess<00:01:46.150> but<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:48.340> come

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
plastic boards I guess but it can come

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.880 
plastic boards I guess but it can come
up<00:01:48.820> pretty<00:01:49.150> easily<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.780> that's<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.140> pro<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.860> a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
up pretty easily and that's a pro in a

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.120 
up pretty easily and that's a pro in a
cone<00:01:51.100> because<00:01:51.870> it<00:01:52.870> can<00:01:53.020> fall<00:01:53.260> off<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.680> maybe

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
cone because it can fall off and maybe

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.710 
cone because it can fall off and maybe
if<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:55.000> wet<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.640> if<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:58.390> falls<00:01:58.600> like

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
if you just wet it and if it falls like

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.790 
if you just wet it and if it falls like
lay<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> ground

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
lay on the ground

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.860 
lay on the ground
it's<00:01:59.980> going<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.220> get<00:02:00.310> all<00:02:00.430> dirty<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.970> your

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
it's going to get all dirty and your

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.940 
it's going to get all dirty and your
makeups<00:02:02.200> going<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.440> be<00:02:02.500> ruined

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
makeups going to be ruined

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.710 
makeups going to be ruined
so<00:02:03.900> another<00:02:04.900> con<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.820> glue<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:10.570> glue

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so another con is that the glue the glue

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.300 
so another con is that the glue the glue
that<00:02:10.750> holds<00:02:11.170> these<00:02:11.830> um<00:02:12.250> these<00:02:13.140> colors<00:02:14.140> on<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
that holds these um these colors on the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.540 
that holds these um these colors on the
board<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.910> not<00:02:16.620> exactly<00:02:17.620> all<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.980> good

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
board it's not exactly all that good

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.310 
board it's not exactly all that good
because<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.710> red<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:22.750> actually<00:02:23.110> come

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
because the red one can actually come

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.210 
because the red one can actually come
out<00:02:23.640> against<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.350> pro<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.160> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
out against this is this is a pro and a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.170 
out against this is this is a pro and a
con<00:02:27.480> con<00:02:28.480> because<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:29.080> falls<00:02:29.590> off<00:02:29.970> bro<00:02:30.970> because

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
