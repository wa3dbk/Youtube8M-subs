because<00:04:42.639> go<00:04:43.389> over<00:04:43.569> the<00:04:43.750> hill<00:04:43.990> which<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.650> will<00:04:44.830> be

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
because go over the hill which I will be

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.909 
because go over the hill which I will be
light<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.759> this<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.330> very<00:04:47.139> difficult<00:04:47.680> to

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
light and this is very difficult to

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.890 
light and this is very difficult to
drive<00:04:48.129> this<00:04:48.550> very<00:04:49.150> fast

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
drive this very fast

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.260 
drive this very fast
the<00:04:50.620> upward<00:04:50.800> inertia<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.639> fast<00:04:51.909> car

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
the upward inertia of a fast car

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.240 
the upward inertia of a fast car
actually<00:04:52.780> makes<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.199> lighter<00:04:53.530> but<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:53.919> across

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
actually makes it lighter but as across

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.399 
actually makes it lighter but as across
the<00:04:54.430> hill<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:55.479> can<00:04:55.659> cause<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.870> loss<00:04:56.199> of

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
the hill that can cause a loss of

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.700 
the hill that can cause a loss of
steering<00:04:56.860> control<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.860> kind<00:05:00.129> of<00:05:00.419> try<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.710> we

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
steering control this kind of try to we

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.189 
steering control this kind of try to we
try<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:03.599> not<00:05:04.599> copy<00:05:05.020> but<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:06.789> have<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.210> in<00:05:07.659> in<00:05:08.020> the

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
try to not copy but to have it in in the

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.450 
try to not copy but to have it in in the
new<00:05:08.319> tracks<00:05:08.650> as<00:05:08.889> well<00:05:10.319> in<00:05:11.319> Istanbul<00:05:11.949> very

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
new tracks as well in Istanbul very

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.089 
new tracks as well in Istanbul very
hilly<00:05:12.969> countryside<00:05:13.500> here<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.740> that's<00:05:14.860> just

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
hilly countryside here and that's just

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.439 
hilly countryside here and that's just
what<00:05:15.219> they've<00:05:15.370> done<00:05:15.610> in<00:05:15.759> their<00:05:15.849> latest<00:05:16.120> big

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
what they've done in their latest big

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.930 
what they've done in their latest big
project<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.199> new<00:05:17.620> f1<00:05:18.039> track<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.550> this<00:05:18.699> demo

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
project a new f1 track in this demo

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.110 
project a new f1 track in this demo
again<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:19.840> here's<00:05:20.229> a<00:05:20.349> very<00:05:20.919> special<00:05:21.669> corners

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
again and here's a very special corners

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.260 
again and here's a very special corners
we<00:05:22.479> tried<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:23.139> find<00:05:23.710> some<00:05:24.159> features<00:05:24.759> similar

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
we tried to find some features similar

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.469 
we tried to find some features similar
to<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.900> Norge<00:05:26.199> life<00:05:26.530> within<00:05:27.400> Turkey<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.330> I

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
to the Norge life within Turkey and I

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.110 
to the Norge life within Turkey and I
think<00:05:28.750> we<00:05:28.840> got<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.229> they<00:05:30.039> use<00:05:30.190> string<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.909> mark

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
think we got it they use string to mark

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.119 
think we got it they use string to mark
potential<00:05:31.629> racing<00:05:32.020> lines<00:05:32.259> on<00:05:32.530> one<00:05:32.770> hilly

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
potential racing lines on one hilly

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.219 
potential racing lines on one hilly
section<00:05:33.400> of<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.819> circuit<00:05:34.180> for<00:05:34.569> me<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.990> should

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
section of the circuit for me it should

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.670 
section of the circuit for me it should
be<00:05:35.259> more<00:05:35.590> like<00:05:35.650> this<00:05:36.009> coming<00:05:36.580> from<00:05:36.789> up<00:05:37.029> here

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
be more like this coming from up here

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.850 
be more like this coming from up here
going<00:05:38.849> straight<00:05:39.849> down<00:05:40.090> and<00:05:40.620> up<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.830> hill

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
going straight down and up the hill

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.830 
going straight down and up the hill
something<00:05:42.759> like<00:05:42.909> this<00:05:43.120> also<00:05:44.050> I<00:05:44.529> think<00:05:45.659> this<00:05:46.659> is

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
something like this also I think this is

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.820 
something like this also I think this is
very<00:05:47.069> challenging<00:05:48.069> because<00:05:48.219> we<00:05:48.520> have<00:05:48.699> a<00:05:49.830> going

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
very challenging because we have a going

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.370 
very challenging because we have a going
over<00:05:51.789> the<00:05:51.909> hill<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:52.419> then<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:52.750> tower<00:05:53.139> will<00:05:53.349> be

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
over the hill and then the tower will be

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.620 
over the hill and then the tower will be
light<00:05:53.710> yeah<00:05:54.669> will<00:05:55.060> be<00:05:55.240> not<00:05:56.169> flying<00:05:56.590> but<00:05:56.979> flows

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
light yeah will be not flying but flows

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.629 
light yeah will be not flying but flows
close<00:05:58.630> before<00:05:58.900> flying<00:05:59.440> it<00:05:59.710> and<00:05:59.830> this<00:06:00.039> part<00:06:00.400> has

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
close before flying it and this part has

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.249 
close before flying it and this part has
something<00:06:01.090> of<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.330> green<00:06:01.569> hill<00:06:01.870> at<00:06:02.110> the

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
something of the green hill at the

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.110 
something of the green hill at the
newbie<00:06:02.560> showing<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:02.949> launch<00:06:03.129> laughter<00:06:03.639> this

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
newbie showing the launch laughter this

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.600 
newbie showing the launch laughter this
makes<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:04.509> perfect<00:06:04.930> with<00:06:05.650> the<00:06:05.770> Istanbul<00:06:06.279> track

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
makes it perfect with the Istanbul track

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.399 
makes it perfect with the Istanbul track

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.840 
sights set on Mexico there are plans for
an<00:06:13.779> f1<00:06:13.930> track<00:06:14.409> in<00:06:14.620> Cancun

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
an f1 track in Cancun

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.900 
an f1 track in Cancun
and<00:06:17.180> so<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:18.080> old<00:06:18.260> Nurburgring<00:06:19.130> may<00:06:19.520> inspire

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
and so the old Nurburgring may inspire

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.630 
and so the old Nurburgring may inspire
yet<00:06:20.270> another<00:06:20.510> new<00:06:20.780> design<00:06:21.200> this<00:06:21.890> time<00:06:22.190> in<00:06:22.550> the

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
yet another new design this time in the

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.820 
yet another new design this time in the
New<00:06:22.790> World
