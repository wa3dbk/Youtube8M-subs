00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
just kind of post my thoughts my

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.020 
just kind of post my thoughts my
opinions<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.600> iphone<00:00:46.200> 6

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
opinions and what I want in the iphone 6

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
opinions and what I want in the iphone 6
so<00:00:48.030> first<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.469> I'll

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so first of all first thing I'll

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.729 
so first of all first thing I'll
probably<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:52.050> obvious<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
probably like to see is pretty obvious a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.490 
probably like to see is pretty obvious a
faster<00:00:53.190> chip<00:00:53.489> iOS<00:00:54.180> 6<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:55.820> new<00:00:56.820> type<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
faster chip iOS 6 a new type of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.540 
faster chip iOS 6 a new type of
touchscreen<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.770> may<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.039> made<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
touchscreen so may be made of a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
touchscreen so may be made of a
different<00:00:59.579> type<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.090> metal<00:01:00.680> more<00:01:01.680> memory

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
different type of metal more memory

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.310 
different type of metal more memory
improved<00:01:03.570> battery<00:01:03.840> those<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:04.650> basics

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
improved battery those are pretty basics

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.700 
improved battery those are pretty basics
so<00:01:07.320> definitely<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.490> should<00:01:08.850> happen<00:01:09.710> at

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so definitely that should happen at

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.500 
so definitely that should happen at
least<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.100> what<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
least that's what I would like to see a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.730 
least that's what I would like to see a
better<00:01:13.290> camera<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:14.070> also<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> major<00:01:15.060> plus

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
better camera would also be a major plus

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.730 
better camera would also be a major plus
so<00:01:17.210> good<00:01:18.210> better<00:01:18.479> quality<00:01:19.340> sharper<00:01:20.340> quality

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
so good better quality sharper quality

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
so good better quality sharper quality
ratna<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.070> sharper<00:01:23.490> retina<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.750> be

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
ratna the sharper retina that would be

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.429 
ratna the sharper retina that would be
really<00:01:25.080> sweet<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.979> happen<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
really sweet if that can happen and

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
really sweet if that can happen and
pretty<00:01:28.439> much<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.000> few<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
pretty much that's just a few of the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.929 
pretty much that's just a few of the
things<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.590> could<00:01:31.799> make<00:01:31.939> just

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
things you know if they could make just

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
things you know if they could make just
a<00:01:33.210> nice<00:01:33.570> maybe<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.400> tiny

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a nice maybe a little bit just a tiny

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870 
a nice maybe a little bit just a tiny
bit<00:01:35.790> slimmer<00:01:36.360> design<00:01:37.250> I'm<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.430> sure<00:01:38.700> how

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
bit slimmer design I'm not sure how

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090 
bit slimmer design I'm not sure how
they're<00:01:39.060> doing<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.540> iphone<00:01:39.930> 5<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.470> course<00:01:40.740> but

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
they're doing the iphone 5 of course but

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
they're doing the iphone 5 of course but
you<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.540> slight

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you know these are just some slight

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
you know these are just some slight
guesses<00:01:43.439> some<00:01:43.920> predictions<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:46.520> features

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
guesses some predictions on the features

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.050 
guesses some predictions on the features
of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.270> iPhone<00:01:48.299> 6<00:01:48.689> coming<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
of the iPhone 6 coming out so you know I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
of the iPhone 6 coming out so you know I
just<00:01:51.240> decided<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.110> video<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
just decided to do this video I know it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.819 
just decided to do this video I know it
really<00:01:53.780> doesn't<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.990> don't<00:01:55.470> think<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
really doesn't I don't think it's that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.340 
really doesn't I don't think it's that
relevant<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> anything<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
relevant to anything right now but you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.039 
relevant to anything right now but you
know<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> thought<00:01:58.829> why<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.600> most<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
know I thought why not so I know most of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.219 
know I thought why not so I know most of
my<00:02:01.200> videos<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.189> tie-in<00:02:02.520> between

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
my videos they kind of tie-in between

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
my videos they kind of tie-in between
gaming<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> technology<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.030> one's<00:02:06.210> kind

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
gaming and technology so this one's kind

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.130 
gaming and technology so this one's kind
of<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> tech<00:02:08.030> category<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.300> stay
