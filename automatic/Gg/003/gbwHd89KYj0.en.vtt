know if you go through all that hot
water<00:00:40.860> pipe<00:00:41.219> business<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.469> top<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.160> down

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
water pipe business so it's top on down

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
water pipe business so it's top on down
here<00:00:45.950> going<00:00:46.950> through<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.340> door<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:49.219> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
here going through this door and the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
here going through this door and the

Harley Quinn trophy is actually in a
pretty<00:00:51.930> obscure<00:00:52.620> location<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.340> that's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
pretty obscure location I think that's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
why not many people have got their hands

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
why not many people have got their hands
on<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.620> they're<00:00:55.829> asking<00:00:56.160> me<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.579> help<00:00:56.699> you
