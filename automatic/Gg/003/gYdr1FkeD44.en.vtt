00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
this year from the race yeah I think for

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.580 
this year from the race yeah I think for
sure<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.610> mean<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.940> think<00:03:13.970> they're<00:03:14.500> there<00:03:15.500> are

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
sure I mean I think they're there are

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.490 
sure I mean I think they're there are
probably<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:16.040> dozen<00:03:16.400> guys<00:03:16.730> who<00:03:17.180> could<00:03:17.840> could

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
probably a dozen guys who could could

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.190 
probably a dozen guys who could could
run<00:03:18.740> right<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.580> that<00:03:19.670> leap<00:03:19.880> back<00:03:20.120> for<00:03:20.720> large

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
run right in that leap back for large

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.720 
run right in that leap back for large
portions<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.860> day<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.640> know

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
portions of the day and you know

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.920 
portions of the day and you know
obviously<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.300> not<00:03:23.360> going<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.720> stay<00:03:23.900> that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
obviously it's not going to stay that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.710 
obviously it's not going to stay that
tight<00:03:24.410> for<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.730> whole<00:03:25.880> race<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.330> mean<00:03:26.480> as<00:03:26.600> it

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
tight for the whole race I mean as it

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.840 
tight for the whole race I mean as it
isn't<00:03:27.080> gets<00:03:27.920> further<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.400> its<00:03:28.670> going<00:03:28.790> to

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
isn't gets further in its going to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.990 
isn't gets further in its going to
spread<00:03:29.060> out<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.570> but<00:03:30.470> it's<00:03:31.400> exciting<00:03:31.700> you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000

under 15 on the course this year someone
no<00:05:39.690> I<00:05:39.720> mean<00:05:40.020> definitely<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.760> definitely<00:05:41.760> a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
no I mean definitely a definitely a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.390 
no I mean definitely a definitely a
possibility<00:05:42.300> yeah<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.780> mean<00:05:43.190> Tony<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.370> were

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
possibility yeah I mean Tony and I were

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.090 
possibility yeah I mean Tony and I were
so<00:05:44.670> close<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.180> last<00:05:45.360> year<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:47.010> know

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
so close to that last year and you know

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.180 
so close to that last year and you know
I<00:05:47.160> don't<00:05:47.280> know<00:05:48.350> exactly<00:05:49.350> what<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:49.620> could<00:05:49.980> do<00:05:50.160> to

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
I don't know exactly what I could do to

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.100 
I don't know exactly what I could do to
really<00:05:50.910> do<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.210> much<00:05:51.360> faster<00:05:51.390> than<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:51.930> did<00:05:52.080> last

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
really do it much faster than I did last

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.800 
really do it much faster than I did last
year<00:05:52.410> but<00:05:52.790> it's<00:05:53.790> certainly<00:05:53.970> possible<00:05:54.300> i<00:05:54.630> think

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
year but it's certainly possible i think

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.530 
year but it's certainly possible i think
i'm<00:05:54.960> i<00:05:55.320> think<00:05:55.860> i<00:05:56.100> am<00:05:56.250> in<00:05:56.370> better<00:05:56.490> shape<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.060> i'm

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
i'm i think i am in better shape and i'm

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.190 
i'm i think i am in better shape and i'm
a<00:05:57.660> stronger<00:05:58.020> runner<00:05:58.200> than<00:05:58.410> I<00:05:58.470> was<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.650> year<00:05:58.770> ago

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.350 

so<00:06:01.830> yeah<00:06:02.070> it's<00:06:02.340> definitely<00:06:02.520> a<00:06:02.700> possibility<00:06:02.970> I

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
so yeah it's definitely a possibility I

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.590 
so yeah it's definitely a possibility I
wouldn't<00:06:03.720> I<00:06:03.960> wouldn't<00:06:04.700> bet<00:06:05.700> on<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.910> I<00:06:06.270> don't

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
wouldn't I wouldn't bet on it I don't

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.890 
wouldn't I wouldn't bet on it I don't
think<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:06.900> think<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.140> do<00:06:07.200> I<00:06:07.590> think<00:06:08.550> I'd<00:06:08.640> uh<00:06:08.900> put

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
think I think I do I think I'd uh put

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.570 
think I think I do I think I'd uh put
