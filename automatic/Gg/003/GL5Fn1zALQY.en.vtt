00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
this why is your drifting this series

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.630 
this why is your drifting this series
and<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:42.769> should<00:03:42.950> be<00:03:43.040> going<00:03:43.220> pretty<00:03:43.340> well<00:03:43.489> i

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
and it should be going pretty well i

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.860 
and it should be going pretty well i
mean<00:03:43.849> i'm<00:03:44.000> going<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.209> be<00:03:44.269> getting<00:03:44.390> these<00:03:44.599> out<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
mean i'm going to be getting these out a

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.990 
mean i'm going to be getting these out a
little<00:03:45.049> bit<00:03:45.170> more<00:03:45.590> than<00:03:45.890> suicide<00:03:46.280> episodes

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
little bit more than suicide episodes

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.520 
little bit more than suicide episodes
because<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.599> suicides<00:03:48.110> are<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> little<00:03:48.380> bit

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
because the suicides are a little bit

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.410 
because the suicides are a little bit
harder<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.829> get<00:03:49.099> I've<00:03:49.670> been<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:50.120> getting

really<00:04:23.720> is<00:04:24.020> just<00:04:25.010> that's<00:04:25.190> wheelbase<00:04:25.700> is

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
really is just that's wheelbase is

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.150 
really is just that's wheelbase is
really<00:04:26.180> short<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.720> if<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.050> see<00:04:27.889> if<00:04:28.010> you're

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
really short so if you see if you're

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.680 
really short so if you see if you're
trying<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.400> correct<00:04:28.610> yourself<00:04:28.789> somehow<00:04:29.270> and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
trying to correct yourself somehow and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.490 
trying to correct yourself somehow and
it's<00:04:30.410> very<00:04:30.740> easy<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.250> overshoot<00:04:32.180> or<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:33.289> just

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
it's very easy to overshoot or to just

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.089 
it's very easy to overshoot or to just
spin<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.460> car<00:04:34.639> completely<00:04:35.000> out<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:35.720> um<00:04:36.070> but<00:04:37.070> I
