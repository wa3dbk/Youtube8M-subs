00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.940
Today, farming must deliver greater,
improved production.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.880
In addition to profitability and competitiveness,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.300
new requirements relating
to protection of the environment

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.620
and sustainable development
have made their appearance.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.600
Proof by MICHELIN Ultraflex Technologies

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.320
The MICHELIN Group’s extensive innovation capability,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.660
always closely linked to market requirements,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
means that tires are able to constitute
an element of response to the challenges of farming.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.500
With the exclusive MICHELIN Ultraflex technology,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.680
the result of four years’ research,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.540
MICHELIN has taken up the challenge
to sustainably improve agronomic output

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.360
and, at the same time,
reduce the operating costs of farmers.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.500
MICHELIN Ultraflex technology
has two main operating characteristics:

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.700
with the same load,
it allows pressure to be reduced

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.770
or the load capacity increased by
up to 40% with the same pressure.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.340
The benefits of this patented technology are
considerable.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.400
First of all, increased traction

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.189
thanks to a reduction of wheel spin of around 40%,

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.920
resulting in savings on fuel of up to 10%

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.740
as well as on working time.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.260
Then, crop protection

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.880
and a significant increase in yield

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.740
thanks to less soil compaction.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.660
And, finally,
optimized longevity and comfort on the road

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.720
thanks to new blends of rubber
and a flat profile.
