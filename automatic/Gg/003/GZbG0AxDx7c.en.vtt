00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
for example imaging somebody to see what

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
they want to buy so for example if if

they want to buy so for example if if
everything<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.940> do<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.680> result<00:05:20.010> of

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
everything I do is the result of
