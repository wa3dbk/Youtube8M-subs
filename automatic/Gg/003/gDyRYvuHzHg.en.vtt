00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Terran installations management of actions 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.700
 of hackers 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.969
 I came from another planet greetings from 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.920
 hard to breathe agenda and speaks only right 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.529
 gives quick'm already lucky here to do 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.109
 one more ag for you a good attack of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.140
 today of flames xuxa xuxa is called hi 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.480
 What is my all-time favorite? 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 I ask myself where I'm from. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 out of 10 in this and such and very clothes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.980
 colored and my hair color of your vote and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.450
 It's one thing I do not care much about and I 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.129
 I respect this page and I think you 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.480
 They'll know a little bit more, we'll see. 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.730
 if it is not my questions I look 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 now together you respond not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.190
 have something that caused us to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.039
 best 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.530
 although the first question is which type 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 of clothes that you would never make me face 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.559
 I think there's a lot of clothes on that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 You would not like it because I think 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.410
 any kind of clothing you can 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.210
 transform it into a work that you 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.649
 I would use the way you can buy something in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 store you think you never know you 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.070
 can you customize her a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.270
 thing you will use 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.460
 so I guess the only thing that maybe 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 I would not use to be a burqa for what 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.100
 I'll wear burka people a clothing 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.110
 nun 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 I do not know, I think it does not have any 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.340
 clothes I would not wear because I can 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.689
 turn it into a thing gave way to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.030
 second question what kind of clothes do you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.729
 use I like to wear clothes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 comfortable kind of life 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.540
 when you get up and feel good or you 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 You do not have to be tidying up all the time. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 type cyber shot that pops up my chest 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.259
 then the short is short I like to put 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 comfortable clothing for the boot the name of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.280
 a lightweight seat and a windbreaker, and I'm 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 I'm the happiest person in the world that I 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.600
 I knew I needed it in LED so I always type 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.579
 Vote gay in a windbreaker and I'm happy. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.890
 Happy is a movie that I really like 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.960
 to use the third question that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 with you - like or dislike 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.220
 depending on the type of clothes are going 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.530
 hit a lot like this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 I have nothing against type are 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.399
 but I think it depends on the clothes of the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 does not consider it likely that this type of 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.460
 of stamp 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.460
 I just stood there with a palm print 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.890
 I care very prestigious stamp of thing 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.630
 I think depending on the drawing but 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.149
 felt any type of print depends on 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.890
 the world's clothes the way it's going to go 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.350
 I do not think there's anything to the preston. 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.959
 now the fourth question is already 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.060
 did you use anything just for having expensive dani? 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.560
 When something I think she does not 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.030
 will be fine 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.850
 It's what I do I look at the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.020
 character nothing then matipu to I used 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.730
 just because the defender 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.620
 Everything I earn I think it will not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.360
 be good to give a stir can walk 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.870
 They will climb that I take all 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 characters all I know there anything 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.940
 Anything missing, I'm getting something. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.130
 one improved by the boot a short thing 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.019
 here does something you can not use 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.030
 I do not think I would not use just for 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.840
 to please its use because I 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.709
 taste 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.760
 The fifth question will make it fall 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.750
 cool has nothing against as I do not 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 had attempted 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.550
 I even get ahead because uninsured 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 I did not have to insure I think 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.360
 invest as archaic subject I like 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.160
 be out and think it's beautiful 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.260
 let's score against him because he 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.829
 Never did anything mean 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.890
 I liked it and left me naked in public until 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.989
 this question and skirt or dress difficult 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.640
 because I like both of them 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.579
 but I think that every day I finish 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.650
 using more I think the more you get out and 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.780
 dressed because only I 'm going to take calcium 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.570
 abusive firefox goes away with my 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.940
 It 's a good job , I use it so now. 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.100
 I dress really hot. 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.720
 It's too lazy to wear clothes. I use mixed. 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.330
 x 1 lap but I think I 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.980
 know to attack the question they claim to be 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.170
 Do you think it's beautiful? 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.150
 I have things like that at home 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.080
 people speak recent does not show but 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.840
 I use pioneer but I use prints 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.610
 by a guy called a dinosaur I use 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.620
 I use a lot of things I think 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.850
 people like this do not like forum knows that 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.910
 I do not like asking a typical case. 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.900
 prints last legs stamped so the 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.330
 I do not use it, I like it very much 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.470
 what would be an ordinary outfit I think 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.400
 I'm going to say something has nothing to do 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.170
 with that and I think the book you 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.209
 vest or clothing and vulgar I think 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.980
 depends on who invests as mexico 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.180
 another question what are the four colors 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.480
 What else do you have in your wardrobe? 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.070
 black white gray and blue 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.530
 I'm one of the things I most have 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.240
 normal black and white and gray because I 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.890
 I'm very colorful and use a lot 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.530
 they are making one of the glasses again 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.330
 caps are neutral colors because they already use 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.430
 a lot of things like that I like a lot 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.680
 so I always try to buy things from 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.230
 more neutral colors and the blue I love 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.370
 and I like clothes the last Monday 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.830
 with the things that you do not have this 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.419
 I do not wear any kind of clothes . 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.990
 Race has nothing against brown type 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.760
 beige the red yellow I use all 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.500
 types of trees since I spoke in the goal 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.080
 of tie to this break still led to a 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.200
 colored ball is free and if I tell and 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.950
 Harmonious xata I use and I'm happy in 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.900
 play a sim 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.490
 The fetag my fashion I hope they have 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.960
 I like I think I would be a little 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.270
 The more interesting I liked her 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.740
 have a few more questions to ask about 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.830
 My personality when it comes to dressing 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.700
 in styles of this type of thing 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.990
 I found it very simple this team well half 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.850
 Answer there I hope you have 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.930
 liked that I'll let the networks 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.360

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.979

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.990
 conventional medium
