topsy-turvy and hypnosis from what we

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.089 
topsy-turvy and hypnosis from what we
know<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.840> contrary<00:02:07.439> being<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.920> u-turn<00:02:08.399> type

know the contrary being a u-turn type
stat<00:02:11.099> lowering<00:02:11.580> move<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.239> lowers<00:02:12.420> your

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
stat lowering move so it lowers your

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.940 
stat lowering move so it lowers your
opponent<00:02:13.319> stats<00:02:13.560> then

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
opponent stats then

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830
