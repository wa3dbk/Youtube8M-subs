quick-set well I want some custard for
you<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.080> quick<00:00:34.320> science<00:00:34.500> would<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> thought

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
you so quick science would be a thought

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.259 
you so quick science would be a thought
very<00:00:35.190> well<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> penny<00:00:35.760> good<00:00:36.000> how<00:00:36.150> are<00:00:36.180> we

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
very well in for a penny good how are we

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.400 
very well in for a penny good how are we
gonna<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.629> it<00:00:36.780> well

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
gonna do it well

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.770 
gonna do it well
quicksand<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> saturated<00:00:38.730> sand<00:00:39.030> whose<00:00:39.510> grains

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
quicksand is saturated sand whose grains

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.630 
quicksand is saturated sand whose grains
are<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.140> loose<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.739> slide<00:00:41.070> past<00:00:41.100> each

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
are so loose that they slide past each

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
are so loose that they slide past each
other<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.120> pressure<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> applied<00:00:42.570> now<00:00:43.440> here

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
other when pressure is applied now here

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.930 
other when pressure is applied now here
I've<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:43.860> some<00:00:44.010> dry<00:00:44.340> sand

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I've got some dry sand

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
I've got some dry sand
okay<00:00:45.239> compact<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> put<00:00:46.380> pressure<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
okay compact when you put pressure on it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
okay compact when you put pressure on it
just<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.250> solid<00:00:47.610> yes<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.320> sand<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> too

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
just go solid yes but if the sand is too

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.299 
just go solid yes but if the sand is too
wet

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
wet

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
wet
there's<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.700> gonna<00:00:50.850> act<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.450> yeah

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
there's just gonna act like water yeah

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
there's just gonna act like water yeah
you<00:00:51.989> drop<00:00:52.200> like<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> stone<00:00:52.530> yeah<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you drop like a stone yeah we're good so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
you drop like a stone yeah we're good so
how<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.180> gonna<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.450> it<00:00:54.510> work<00:00:54.809> well<00:00:55.140> we

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
how we're gonna make it work well we

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.180 
how we're gonna make it work well we
need<00:00:55.379> something<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.800> between<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.160> two

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
need something in between the two

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.930 
need something in between the two
mixtures<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.450> get<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:57.809> sand<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.320> here

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
mixtures we get some sand from here

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
mixtures we get some sand from here
we'll<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.360> enough<00:01:00.899> water<00:01:01.110> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
we'll see there's just enough water so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.660 
we'll see there's just enough water so
that<00:01:01.559> when<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.890> apply<00:01:02.100> pressure

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that when we apply pressure

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
that when we apply pressure
oh<00:01:02.760> you're<00:01:03.270> seeing<00:01:03.449> slowly<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.920> we

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129

when<00:01:30.619> they're<00:01:30.799> on<00:01:30.950> holiday<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:32.179> plan<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.600> to

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
when they're on holiday the plan is to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.050 
when they're on holiday the plan is to
dig<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:33.110> really<00:01:33.710> deep<00:01:34.009> hole<00:01:34.310> big<00:01:34.700> enough<00:01:34.759> to

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
dig a really deep hole big enough to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.510 
dig a really deep hole big enough to
swallow<00:01:35.359> John<00:01:35.780> tickle<00:01:36.229> hole<00:01:36.500> making<00:01:37.340> sure

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
swallow John tickle hole making sure

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.880 
swallow John tickle hole making sure
they<00:01:37.700> keep<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.090> sand<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.929> barrels<00:01:39.350> then

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
they keep the sand in the barrels then

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.039 
they keep the sand in the barrels then
when<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.250> sand<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.640> mixed<00:01:41.030> with<00:01:41.149> water<00:01:41.209> John

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
when the sand is mixed with water John

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.230 
when the sand is mixed with water John
can<00:01:42.319> walk<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.890> hopefully<00:01:43.640> sink<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:46.240> what's

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
can walk and hopefully sink in it what's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.179 
can walk and hopefully sink in it what's
it<00:01:47.360> all<00:01:47.450> about<00:01:47.479> them<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:48.020> quick<00:01:48.319> sanding<00:01:48.679> it's

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
it all about them is quick sanding it's

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.800 
it all about them is quick sanding it's
really<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.579> common<00:01:49.939> fallacy<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.479> quicksand

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
really a common fallacy that quicksand

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.899 
really a common fallacy that quicksand
sucks<00:01:51.350> people<00:01:51.799> in<00:01:51.950> Italy<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.520> doesn't<00:01:52.759> happen

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
sucks people in Italy it doesn't happen

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.539 
sucks people in Italy it doesn't happen
like<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.239> no<00:01:53.929> quicksand<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.739> just<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.159> liquid

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
like that no quicksand is just a liquid

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.309 
like that no quicksand is just a liquid
with<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> unit<00:01:56.090> weight<00:01:56.239> twice<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.959> of<00:01:56.989> water

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
with a unit weight twice that of water

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.859 
with a unit weight twice that of water
so<00:01:58.280> left<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.729> its<00:01:58.880> own<00:01:58.970> devices<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.630> human

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
so left to its own devices the human

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.779 
so left to its own devices the human
body<00:02:00.049> will<00:02:00.259> should<00:02:00.470> float<00:02:00.979> happy<00:02:01.459> and<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.610> half

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
body will should float happy and a half

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.130 
body will should float happy and a half
out<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.149> water<00:02:02.239> to<00:02:02.569> serve<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.899> there

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
out of the water to serve up to there

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.109 
out of the water to serve up to there
yeah<00:02:03.739> so<00:02:04.159> what<00:02:04.310> about<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.640> films<00:02:04.939> when

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
yeah so what about in the films when

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.399 
yeah so what about in the films when
they<00:02:05.209> used<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.420> go<00:02:05.569> on<00:02:05.599> and<00:02:05.689> shout<00:02:06.200> don't

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
they used to go on and shout don't

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.620 
they used to go on and shout don't
struggle<00:02:06.799> your<00:02:07.189> tink<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.239> should<00:02:08.390> do<00:02:08.509> is

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
struggle your tink what you should do is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.630 
struggle your tink what you should do is
stay<00:02:08.810> still<00:02:09.200> if<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.860> struggle<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.280> mess<00:02:10.489> up

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
stay still if you struggle you mess up

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.180 
stay still if you struggle you mess up
the<00:02:10.759> physics<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.390> you'll<00:02:11.840> bog<00:02:12.110> down<00:02:12.440> lift

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
the physics and you'll bog down lift

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.680 
the physics and you'll bog down lift
your<00:02:13.280> own<00:02:13.459> devices<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:14.000> will<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.209> Bob<00:02:14.450> back

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
your own devices it will just Bob back

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.059 
your own devices it will just Bob back
up<00:02:14.870> again<00:02:15.140> but<00:02:15.260> you've<00:02:15.410> run<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.799> air<00:02:16.040> long

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
up again but you've run out of air long

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.490 
up again but you've run out of air long
before<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.819> happens<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.079> a<00:02:18.140> bit<00:02:18.290> late

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
before that happens so it's a bit late

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.740 
before that happens so it's a bit late
yeah<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:19.700> you're<00:02:19.879> gonna<00:02:19.970> struggle<00:02:20.239> no

going to do this on holiday make sure
you<00:02:37.730> pack<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> lot<00:02:38.150> has<00:02:38.269> bin<00:02:38.510> bags<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.019> your

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
you pack a lot has bin bags in your

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.110 
you pack a lot has bin bags in your
language<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.370> do<00:02:40.459> want<00:02:40.639> to<00:02:40.670> pop<00:02:40.880> out

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
language so if you do want to pop out

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.789 
language so if you do want to pop out
what<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.660> like<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.900> do<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.139> just<00:02:42.319> spread<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.590> all

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
what I like to do is just spread it all

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.650 
what I like to do is just spread it all
around<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.310> top<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:43.549> then<00:02:43.940> everybody<00:02:44.269> get<00:02:44.540> an

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
around the top and then everybody get an

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.240 
around the top and then everybody get an
edge

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
edge

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.520 
edge
so<00:02:46.940> I'm<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.300> only<00:02:47.420> person<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.110> edge<00:02:48.320> then

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
so I'm the only person on this edge then

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.420 
so I'm the only person on this edge then
what<00:02:48.680> come<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.600> let<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.630> down<00:02:50.840> gently<00:02:54.430> okay

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
what come on let it down gently okay

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.850 
what come on let it down gently okay
