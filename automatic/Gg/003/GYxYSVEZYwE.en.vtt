 I have to pair it with Bluetooth every time I do it . 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.780
 It may be uncomfortable to decide. 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.890

 And the funny things that you see in the menu are applied immediately 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:05.390

 I saw it for what I wanted to do. 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.040
 No Momo 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.230
 If you search for a restaurant 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:09.540
 This is what you will find at the top of the menu 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.540
 We maintain an expanded view. 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.690
 So just lock it up. I'm worried about the morning. 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.370
 Turn on the table 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.690
 I am able to destroy the morning by touching the illusions possible 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.199
 The buttons 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.199
 Because it came to the top of the can be used very conveniently 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.720
 What is the most important feature for Slim?

 Grove You know about the most useful features. 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:47.800
 Other than that, you can take a quick look at the terrain and see the apartment. 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.800
 As you can see, I did this fairly 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:55.849
 Just give me the right size when you do it all . 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:01.489
 If you compare the size of 2 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:05.059
 5 A typical keyboard, but one half of the keyboard 

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:09.530
 A little over 1 degree and stable 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:15.170
 About half the level a little more big is a board taneyo 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:17.710
 Spring and a few disadvantages can be seen here too 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:23.570
 It's big . It's big . 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.550
 It is short all the time , so when you type , 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.650
 and 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:34.040
 Uh, and do so in a matchuge sticking the car window plate spirited

 You can raise the common and follow the same 8 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:42.440
 It's nice to be on the go and it's a bit hard to hit the page shift instead 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:46.190
 There are some disadvantages to this, but it's possible to get used to it . 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.270
 And if you see something 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.270
 The mention is resolved again. 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:57.100
 When I am carrying or moving something 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:02.560
 You can use these arrows as you move 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:06.670
 Even if you do not go up or down or just touch it, 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.420
 Enabling all the operations off the thunderhead specialty of you 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.570

 In looking at is not just the aluminum Uhh lively and shot him 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.910
 When I went yesterday , there were a lot of Bluetooth keyboards 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.620
 Among them 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:37.060
 The advantages of this kind of heterogeneous os and various funds 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.060
 I can use it conveniently because I provide the kit 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.130
 You can view the mail immediately by clicking on it. 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.130
 I can see right away. 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:54.260
 What is not all keys are all that there is to apply what 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:57.860
 I would have pressed the outside . 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.400
 In so not remembered, press the kid was not a good follower preview 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.400

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.990
 0 is the behavior or I am equal 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.990
 Maki loop'll write 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:17.950
 Yes I think music as well 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.240
 This is how I get to the top of k from the other day 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:24.040
 Walking all the way 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:27.100
 This is especially the case for Android windows . 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.330
 It will only operate in the corresponding hole 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:35.110
 So , I have a quick look at x swing. 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.750
 When yesterday is done , 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:42.550
 Keyboard type 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.980
 Customers spend between heterogeneous coming irregularly What sort of thing look quite useful when you saw 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.310
 I think it's a keyboard. 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.310
 That is all
