 sure youtube was otherwise it's a little 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.629
 rotten to watch a match like that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.700
 but who controls everything alone then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.390

 Smooth enjoy well navigare 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.070
 the bond would be a kind of small 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.190
 how to make money 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.910
 easily 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.160
 but not quickly so in fact we're going 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.710
 not really spend so I want 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.560
 precisely the team for no but I 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.600
 no more time to do the technique 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.740
 we do not really spend so much already 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.170
 to start you have to create a 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.640
 new team so I showed you on 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:59.920
 will take my team sent it back the g1 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.310
 of 3.3 players whose goalkeeper must 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.700
 eleven players will never exceed 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.860
 300 for the player it is necessary that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.990
 Gold players should never be exceeded 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.370
 trojan then 300 for the normal player 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.620
 so why not what are they going to 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.740
 make minimum sale minimum 300 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.420
 credit we stamped you buy them 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.730
 all the time in exchange for overbidding 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.690
 all this it will never have exceeded this 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.820
 price there 3 people overcome fast like 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.470
 I have already told you these three years except 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.910
 for rare you can up to 6 years 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.209
 because we are growing fast 6 years 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.060
 minimum 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.880
 it's the same thing not doing up 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.190
 350 especially if you're going to lose 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.470
 money then you throw the whole team 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.030
 which one needs if you bought day 300 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 maxis and the 3300 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.500
 it's at 3300 once you've lived 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.230
 because you show how we 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.879
 looking for players not very expensive for 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.610
 those who do not really know where we are doing 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:12.140
 research or even there we will in 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.360
 do a little post if you want 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.560
 really a job you can search 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.859
 present as a guardian or whatever 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.079
 thing and here we will put 300 ha yes 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.840
 there it is already outbidded must not 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.930
 to bid otherwise it's 350 must always 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680
 keep a little while for the past received lava 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.620
 or could bid 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.280
 I'm going to make you jean cherry froze to 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.440
 300 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.549
 as I sell the 300 suits me anything 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.560
 but I do not ask them right 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.379
 then you have to buy the whole team 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.440
 but then I'll see her we 'll leave on 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:54.109
 do not care we want to buy any 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:58.760
 the team and after you play there here where 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.769
 jean competition solo money you if you 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.989
 are really strong move you mouth but 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.510
 my money you lose or win it's 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.109
 no big deal because you won 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.579
 money to each party to know 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.199
 when we lose we win about 350 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:17.750
 when we win we can win up 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:23.769
 550 that's okay it's drinking like we 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.769
 wants to win a cut know that's 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.430
 400 cathy we will say 400 each time 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.919
 you win you have 48 that's thousand 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:40.610
 six hundred thousand for match 5 kate 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.310
 that makes 2000 2500 wind 2500 credit per 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.240
 tournament a very important thing when 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.419
 you buy your cards 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.010
 that's what I did not look at 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.349
 that the player is minimum seven contracts 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.770
 otherwise it's not worth it 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.760
 saleh against a minimum we see the bar 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.389
 before I got scammed 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.849
 I should have looked but not proud I 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.289
 sell right now but it's better 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.260
 to have this short trace you have to go 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.790
 search all the time 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.930
 and the crowd happily of them 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.080
 are then wind of these facts is like 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.220
 that after you will earn money 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.480
 and whenever you have more than 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.650
 contract or not buy back no contract 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.980
 wanted to resell and and you start again 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.400
 again for replacements you can 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.600
 take the main team in my 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.190
 main team the one where I have my 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.110
 best players 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.760
 you can take this team where 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.320
 you put the bronze players did not 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.980
 like that you 're going to replace you have 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.140
 no need to buy 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.550
 and you saw ch and 11 players and we 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.660
 basically with seven matches you win at 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.850
 about 3 million 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.610
 a few after you resell the players 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:55.710
 and you buy a site 8 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:57.290
 and there you can go until I want 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.720
 how much thirty thousand forty thousand 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.880
 it's long but it's worth it then 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.400
