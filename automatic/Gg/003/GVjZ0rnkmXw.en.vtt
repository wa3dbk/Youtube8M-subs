this plant help develop top sugars your
objective<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.900> start<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> off<00:00:55.350> right

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
objective is to start it off right

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.830 
objective is to start it off right
putting<00:00:56.460> some<00:00:56.730> things<00:00:56.880> in<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.180> row<00:00:57.330> to<00:00:57.720> make

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
putting some things in the row to make

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
putting some things in the row to make
sure<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> ear<00:00:58.470> can<00:00:58.650> properly<00:00:59.010> size<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
sure that the ear can properly size and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
sure that the ear can properly size and
then<00:01:00.240> feed<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> through<00:01:00.630> the<00:01:00.810> summer<00:01:00.990> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
then feed it through the summer and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
then feed it through the summer and
believe<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.579> other<00:01:02.730> compound

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
believe it or not one other compound

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
believe it or not one other compound
that<00:01:03.450> we're<00:01:03.540> all<00:01:03.660> very<00:01:03.690> familiar<00:01:03.990> with<00:01:04.320> helps

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that we're all very familiar with helps

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
that we're all very familiar with helps
in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> sweetness<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:06.420> table<00:01:06.780> sugar

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
in the sweetness and that's table sugar

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
in the sweetness and that's table sugar
that's<00:01:07.620> right<00:01:07.860> simple<00:01:08.250> sucrose<00:01:08.700> table<00:01:09.540> sugar

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that's right simple sucrose table sugar

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.360 
that's right simple sucrose table sugar
right<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.500> table<00:01:10.680> straight<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.250> this

right off your table straight on to this

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.070 
right off your table straight on to this
plant<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.909> help<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> increase<00:01:12.600> its<00:01:12.840> sugar

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
plant will help it increase its sugar

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440 
plant will help it increase its sugar
plants<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.159> sugar<00:01:14.340> machines<00:01:14.700> they're<00:01:15.090> energy

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
plants or sugar machines they're energy

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.440 
plants or sugar machines they're energy
driven<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> sugar<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:17.010> plenty<00:01:17.370> of<00:01:17.460> energy<00:01:17.580> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
driven and sugar is plenty of energy so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
driven and sugar is plenty of energy so
what<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> normally<00:01:18.720> tell<00:01:19.200> folks<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.400> pick

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
what I normally tell folks to do is pick

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.920 
what I normally tell folks to do is pick
up<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> product<00:01:21.060> called<00:01:21.450> Emerald<00:01:21.840> Mist

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
up a product called Emerald Mist

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.830 
up a product called Emerald Mist
put<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.680> few<00:01:23.860> ounces<00:01:24.010> in<00:01:24.880> several<00:01:25.390> feet<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.660> row

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
put a few ounces in several feet of row

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.800 
put a few ounces in several feet of row
as<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.260> plant<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> crop<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:28.270> come<00:01:28.480> back<00:01:28.510> and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
as you plant the crop then come back and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.390 
as you plant the crop then come back and
foliar<00:01:29.200> feed<00:01:29.440> two<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.800> three<00:01:29.980> times<00:01:30.130> during

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
foliar feed two to three times during

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.850 
foliar feed two to three times during
the<00:01:30.580> season<00:01:30.870> prior<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:32.050> pollination<00:01:32.680> and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
the season prior to pollination and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.940 
the season prior to pollination and
you'll<00:01:33.370> maximize<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.060> sugar<00:01:34.300> in<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.510> plant

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you'll maximize the sugar in this plant

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.020 
you'll maximize the sugar in this plant
the<00:01:35.950> other<00:01:36.100> thing<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.370> will<00:01:36.460> help<00:01:36.640> do<00:01:36.790> is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
the other thing it will help do is

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.480 
the other thing it will help do is
maintain<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.350> integrity<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.130> if<00:01:39.370> you

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
maintain the integrity of this if you

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.490 
maintain the integrity of this if you
pick<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:39.760> today<00:01:40.060> oftentimes<00:01:40.660> by<00:01:40.930> tomorrow<00:01:41.320> or

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
pick it today oftentimes by tomorrow or

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.810 
pick it today oftentimes by tomorrow or
the<00:01:41.560> next<00:01:41.590> day<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.160> lot<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.520> standard

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
the next day on a lot of standard

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.150 
the next day on a lot of standard
varieties<00:01:43.150> lost<00:01:43.780> all<00:01:43.990> its<00:01:44.140> sweetness<00:01:44.350> who

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
varieties lost all its sweetness who

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.790 
varieties lost all its sweetness who
wants<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:45.510> nobody<00:01:46.510> does<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.410> people<00:01:47.680> that
