obviously eco cycle how cool is this we

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
obviously eco cycle how cool is this we
now<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> 3d<00:00:47.850> printer<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.570> uses<00:00:48.989> recycled

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
now have a 3d printer that uses recycled

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
now have a 3d printer that uses recycled
materials<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.640> filaments<00:00:51.239> how<00:00:51.930> did<00:00:52.110> this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
materials and filaments how did this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.660 
materials and filaments how did this
idea<00:00:52.440> come<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:55.620> came<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
idea come about so I came up with the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
idea come about so I came up with the
idea<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:59.449> open-minded<00:01:00.590> awesome<00:01:01.590> guy

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
idea and this open-minded awesome guy

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.109 
idea and this open-minded awesome guy
Abbi<00:01:02.280> saw<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.870> beauty<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.979> know

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
Abbi saw the the beauty of you know

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.440 
Abbi saw the the beauty of you know
turning<00:01:06.119> post-consumer<00:01:06.630> plastics<00:01:07.229> into

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
turning post-consumer plastics into

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
turning post-consumer plastics into
fabric<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.170> print<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.740> 3d

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
fabric that you could print with with 3d

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
fabric that you could print with with 3d
printers<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.930> idea<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
printers so it was an idea just about a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.570 
printers so it was an idea just about a
year<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:15.000> odd<00:01:15.210> months<00:01:15.630> ago<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.580> we're

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
year and some odd months ago and we're

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.749 
year and some odd months ago and we're
sitting<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:17.850> watching<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.360> Frank<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.920> that's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sitting here watching it Frank so that's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
sitting here watching it Frank so that's
you<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> turnaround<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> able<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you know the turnaround to be able to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
you know the turnaround to be able to
make<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.700> happen<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
make that happen because you got to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
make that happen because you got to
understand<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> punch<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.070> melt<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
understand to punch up to melt the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580 
understand to punch up to melt the
plastic<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.659> you're<00:01:28.320> working<00:01:28.470> with

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
plastic you know you're working with

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
plastic you know you're working with
certain<00:01:28.890> temperatures<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.479> figured

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
certain temperatures and they figured

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.510 
certain temperatures and they figured
out<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> math<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.979> amazes<00:01:32.369> me<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
out the math and what amazes me to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.069 
out the math and what amazes me to
Auggie<00:01:32.939> you're<00:01:33.180> always<00:01:33.390> looking<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
Auggie you're always looking into the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.020 
Auggie you're always looking into the
future<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
future as well as you you know do you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
future as well as you you know do you
think<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> next<00:01:36.840> step<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.280> system

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
think that the next step for the system

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
think that the next step for the system
would<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.299> potentially<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> have

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
would actually be potentially to have

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
would actually be potentially to have
bottles<00:01:41.100> inside<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.610> home<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.659> able<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
bottles inside your home to be able to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
bottles inside your home to be able to
make<00:01:43.590> filament<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> them<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> 3d

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
make filament of them and then to 3d

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.399 
make filament of them and then to 3d
print<00:01:45.329> making<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.140> kind<00:01:46.320> of
