thing<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.639> experienced<00:04:31.120> was<00:04:31.180> when<00:04:31.330> I

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
thing that I experienced was when I

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.150 
thing that I experienced was when I
tried<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.630> describe<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.110> valve<00:04:32.410> cap<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.949> from

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
tried to describe the valve cap on from

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.460 
tried to describe the valve cap on from
the<00:04:33.310> air<00:04:33.460> from<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.150> cord<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:35.020> wouldn't<00:04:35.350> go<00:04:35.440> on

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
the air from the cord it wouldn't go on

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.129 
the air from the cord it wouldn't go on
by<00:04:35.740> hand<00:04:36.180> unlike<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.210> airbrush<00:04:37.720> was<00:04:37.930> just

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
by hand unlike the airbrush was just

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.610 
by hand unlike the airbrush was just
screwed<00:04:38.440> on<00:04:38.590> nicely<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.690> had<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.169> had<00:04:41.500> to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
screwed on nicely so I had to I had to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.689 
screwed on nicely so I had to I had to
get<00:04:41.830> out<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.630> pair<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:43.720> pliers<00:04:43.840> out<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.550> do<00:04:45.550> what

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
get out a pair of pliers out and do what

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.390 
get out a pair of pliers out and do what
I<00:04:45.760> by<00:04:46.229> widow<00:04:47.229> with<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.470> tool<00:04:47.830> which<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.190> didn't

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
I by widow with a tool which I didn't

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.570 
I by widow with a tool which I didn't
think<00:04:48.460> was<00:04:48.669> really<00:04:49.180> appropriate<00:04:50.280> but<00:04:51.280> anyway

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
think was really appropriate but anyway

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.950 
think was really appropriate but anyway
so<00:04:51.639> that's<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.030> only<00:04:52.090> problem<00:04:52.600> I've<00:04:52.660> had<00:04:52.690> with

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
so that's the only problem I've had with

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.740 
so that's the only problem I've had with
it<00:04:53.139> otherwise<00:04:53.710> it's<00:04:54.130> nice<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.490> quiet<00:04:54.750> it

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
it otherwise it's nice and quiet it

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.200 
it otherwise it's nice and quiet it
functions<00:04:56.290> really<00:04:56.650> well<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.220> can't<00:04:57.940> for<00:04:58.180> some

functions really well I can't for some

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.180 
functions really well I can't for some
reason<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.900> may<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.470> size<00:04:59.710> of<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.979> needle

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
reason it may be the size of the needle
