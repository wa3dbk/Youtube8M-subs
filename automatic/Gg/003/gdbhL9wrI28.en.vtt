excuse me so tell us what you got new

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.040 
excuse me so tell us what you got new
here<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> got<00:00:26.820> some<00:00:27.119> great<00:00:27.150> looking<00:00:27.570> amps<00:00:27.869> this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
here we got some great looking amps this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.890 
here we got some great looking amps this
so<00:00:28.560> here's<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:29.179> 47<00:00:30.179> th<00:00:30.300> switchable<00:00:30.720> between

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so here's our 47 th switchable between

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.340 
so here's our 47 th switchable between
70<00:00:31.830> watts<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> 40<00:00:32.759> watts<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:34.880> goes<00:00:35.880> from

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
70 watts and 40 watts and it goes from

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.770 
70 watts and 40 watts and it goes from
real<00:00:37.350> clean<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:38.460> primarily<00:00:39.180> why<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> did<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
real clean that's primarily why I did it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.479 
real clean that's primarily why I did it
to<00:00:39.930> show<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.079> clean<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:40.469> clean<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to show how clean my clean is to get the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.790 
to show how clean my clean is to get the
wattage<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.000> into<00:00:42.270> similar<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.290> other<00:00:43.440> amps

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
wattage up into similar my other amps

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
wattage up into similar my other amps
with<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> sustained<00:00:44.760> feature<00:00:45.059> right<00:00:45.329> right

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
with the sustained feature right right

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
with the sustained feature right right
here<00:00:45.750> built<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.739> high-end<00:00:47.129> compression<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
here built in a high-end compression the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
here built in a high-end compression the
other<00:00:48.379> circuitry<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.469> similar<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:50.100> other

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
other circuitry is similar to my other

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.450 
other circuitry is similar to my other
stuff<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.210> has<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> fixed<00:00:51.809> bias<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.500> l34<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
stuff but it has a fixed bias for l34 is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
stuff but it has a fixed bias for l34 is
in<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.610> 70<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.510> 40<00:00:57.780> watt<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in it and the 70 and the 40 watt is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.500 
in it and the 70 and the 40 watt is
switches<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> output<00:00:58.980> transformer<00:00:59.430> two<00:00:59.579> down

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
switches the output transformer two down

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.209 
switches the output transformer two down
to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> ultra<00:01:01.109> linear<00:01:01.440> mode<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to the ultra linear mode to get you the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.560 
to the ultra linear mode to get you the
lower<00:01:02.370> power<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.820> cleans<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> sound<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
lower power and it cleans up the sound a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.490 
lower power and it cleans up the sound a
little<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> little<00:01:04.320> bit<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
little bit so you get a little bit of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.580 
little bit so you get a little bit of
tonal<00:01:05.159> flexibility<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.760> well<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.590> that's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
tonal flexibility as well and that's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.730 
tonal flexibility as well and that's
pretty<00:01:07.740> much<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:10.560> said<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
pretty much it for that it's as I said I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
pretty much it for that it's as I said I
did<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:12.090> show<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.330> clean<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:12.659> clean<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
did it to to show how clean my clean is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.170 
did it to to show how clean my clean is
just<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.220> people<00:01:14.369> could<00:01:14.580> appreciate<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just so people could appreciate it and I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.570 
just so people could appreciate it and I
think<00:01:15.240> Billy<00:01:15.540> did<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> good<00:01:16.170> job<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
think Billy did a good job of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.240 
think Billy did a good job of
exemplifying<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.890> surprisingly<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
exemplifying that and surprisingly it's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.440 
exemplifying that and surprisingly it's

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
hey John tell us about the next stamp

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.310 
hey John tell us about the next stamp
here<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.460> 17<00:01:49.970> wat<00:01:50.210> head<00:01:50.570> yeah<00:01:51.050> this<00:01:51.200> is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
here this is a 17 wat head yeah this is

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.950 
here this is a 17 wat head yeah this is
a<00:01:51.350> 17<00:01:52.340> wat<00:01:52.810> l84<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:56.120> doesn't<00:01:56.480> have<00:01:56.660> instead

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
a 17 wat l84 and it doesn't have instead

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.010 
a 17 wat l84 and it doesn't have instead
of<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.230> sustaining<00:01:57.950> circuit<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.510> pulled<00:01:59.510> that

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
of the sustaining circuit I pulled that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.510 
of the sustaining circuit I pulled that
out<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.410> put<00:02:00.500> an<00:02:00.620> overdrive<00:02:00.980> circuit<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.430> it

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
out and put an overdrive circuit and it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520 
out and put an overdrive circuit and it
foot<00:02:01.700> switchable<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:02.990> get<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.230> cost<00:02:03.440> down

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
foot switchable so you get the cost down

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.250 
foot switchable so you get the cost down
this<00:02:03.770> thing<00:02:03.980> is<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.160> 899<00:02:05.120> you<00:02:05.870> know<00:02:05.960> get<00:02:06.110> some

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
this thing is a 899 you know get some

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.139 
this thing is a 899 you know get some
good<00:02:06.410> value<00:02:06.800> out<00:02:06.980> there<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.790> thing<00:02:08.000> really

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
good value out there this thing really

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.410 
good value out there this thing really
screams<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.960> guess<00:02:09.050> when<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:10.120> give<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.270> try

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
screams so I guess when we give it a try

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.790 
screams so I guess when we give it a try
everything<00:02:11.660> everything<00:02:12.200> else<00:02:12.320> preamp

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
everything everything else preamp

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.430 
everything everything else preamp
section<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.700> everything<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.090> similar<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
section and everything is similar to the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.980 
section and everything is similar to the
other<00:02:15.470> ramp<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.510> they<00:02:17.870> all

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
other ramp so it's you know they all

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.580
