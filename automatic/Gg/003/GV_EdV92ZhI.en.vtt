00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
okay moving on to the next step I'm

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.950 
okay moving on to the next step I'm
gonna<00:03:47.280> do<00:03:47.520> is<00:03:47.670> fold<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.210> half<00:03:48.240> like<00:03:48.690> that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
gonna do is fold it in half like that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.730 
gonna do is fold it in half like that
and<00:03:49.730> then<00:03:50.730> I'm<00:03:51.240> going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.600> attach<00:03:51.990> this<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.560> the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
and then I'm going to attach this to the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.300 
and then I'm going to attach this to the
top<00:03:52.980> edge<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.610> my<00:03:54.420> curtain<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.590> then<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.040> rod

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
top edge of my curtain and then the rod

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.370 
top edge of my curtain and then the rod
I<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.209> will<00:03:57.390> slide<00:03:57.660> through<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:58.110> material

I think will slide through this material
nice<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.130> sturdy<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.730> think<00:04:00.000> it'll<00:04:00.090> be<00:04:00.270> really

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300

nice and sturdy I think it'll be really
pretty<00:04:00.720> too

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.840

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
okay so now that I've got my two pieces

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.390 
okay so now that I've got my two pieces
of<00:04:12.150> fabric<00:04:12.300> pinned<00:04:13.110> together<00:04:13.500> I'm<00:04:13.830> going<00:04:14.220> to

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
of fabric pinned together I'm going to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.370 
of fabric pinned together I'm going to
fill<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.880> off<00:04:15.090> open<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:15.960> up<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.260> we'll<00:04:16.350> see

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
so I made my first booboo it's a little

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.550 
so I made my first booboo it's a little
bit<00:04:59.050> narrower<00:04:59.469> here<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.699> I<00:05:01.180> couldn't<00:05:02.020> just<00:05:02.169> so

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
bit narrower here so I couldn't just so

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.920 
bit narrower here so I couldn't just so

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
very very neatly along the edge and

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:27.790 
very very neatly along the edge and
still<00:05:05.770> catch<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.749> so<00:05:07.749> force<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.259> sort<00:05:08.529> by<00:05:08.590> hand

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800

it's<00:06:04.129> actually<00:06:04.399> really<00:06:04.789> simple<00:06:05.059> to<00:06:05.269> do<00:06:05.419> with<00:06:05.719> a

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:05.749 
it's actually really simple to do with a

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.619 
it's actually really simple to do with a
lot<00:06:06.110> of<00:06:06.139> payoff<00:06:06.679> and<00:06:06.919> there's<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.819> green<00:06:08.119> full

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
lot of payoff and there's the green full

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
lot of payoff and there's the green full
suede<00:06:09.080> along<00:06:09.649> the<00:06:09.830> top<00:06:10.099> which<00:06:10.459> covers<00:06:10.879> my<00:06:11.149> rod

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:11.649 
suede along the top which covers my rod

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:14.679

beautifully<00:06:12.649> it's<00:06:13.429> a<00:06:13.459> lot<00:06:13.639> darker<00:06:13.969> green<00:06:14.449> than

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:14.689 
beautifully it's a lot darker green than

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.749 
beautifully it's a lot darker green than
I<00:06:14.719> thought<00:06:14.989> it<00:06:15.139> was<00:06:15.229> going<00:06:15.439> to<00:06:15.619> be<00:06:15.769> well<00:06:16.550> I<00:06:16.580> mean

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
I thought it was going to be well I mean

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.009 
I thought it was going to be well I mean
when<00:06:16.939> you<00:06:17.029> compare<00:06:17.360> it<00:06:17.389> to<00:06:17.539> my<00:06:17.659> kitchen

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:18.019 
when you compare it to my kitchen

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:20.529 
when you compare it to my kitchen
cabinets<00:06:18.529> that<00:06:18.649> I<00:06:18.800> lined<00:06:19.099> so<00:06:20.089> I'll<00:06:20.240> show<00:06:20.479> you
