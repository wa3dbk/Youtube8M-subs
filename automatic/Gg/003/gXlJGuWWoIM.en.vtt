00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 Welcome to another class on 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.040
 bio-progressive mechanics of the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.590
 garden was not there speaking is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.380
 teacher there and in this presentation 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.529
 we will consider considerations and manufacture 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.279
 las vegas spring used in retraction 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 of the upper canine tooth 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.230
 the retraction mechanism of the elements 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 of the maxilla comprising the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 group within a body causes caninha 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.690
 in two steps, ie initially 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 retracts the canines and then the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.300
 to facilitate the strategy and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 courage not to slips 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.649
 consequently there are no frictions 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 resulting from the flexing of the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.149
 bragantino 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 this extremely accurate technique 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.180
 allows the band to move the group 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.750
 of 10 with total torque control in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.140
 beginning to end of treatment 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.510
 this ball of height between 8 and 11 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.880
 millimeters in the upper portion and 3 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.729
 mm inside is made 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.119
 crohn cobalt wire specifically one 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.189
 ice blue rocky mountain and allows 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.310
 that a series of privatizations be 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.070
 incorporating the natural reactions 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.619
 to predict the behavior of the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.030
 beto complex violate the application of 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.850
 certain force 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.180
 this is always evaluated with dynamometer 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.400
 and great strength will depend on the area 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.950
 surface facing the root of the tooth 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.530
 and is about 100 grams per 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.590
 square centimeter when we go 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.210
 to retract your canine hand in the area through 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.210
 from brazil 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.270
 inside and with an intensity and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.610
 approximate the area corresponding to the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.090
 and 75 hundredths of square centimeters 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.600
 requiring no more than 75 to 85 grams of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.600
 force 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.370
 first let's look at the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.440
 better course and less friction than 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.310
 this path will take you through the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.130
 attraction 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.570
 It is clear that a simple relationship 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.430
 will cause this root to move 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.180
 dragging along the cutting lime 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 cistern is have to see the boss in 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.739
 way 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.410
 a compact and little vascularized it 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.269
 represents friction and a difficulty 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.180
 higher for handling 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.090
 so what we do we apply a touch 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.640
 negative in the canine section for those 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.050
 this movement is equal in direction 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.620
 to the most vascularized us 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.980
 consequently with more food 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.280
 cellular phones responsible for their 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.120
 I'm going to play and with that, 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.700
 easier movement 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.370
 the mayor the traction produces a 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.430
 excluded and we have 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.299
 making a 45 degree bend to 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.060
 cervical 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.690
 as if to include the tooth in the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.450
 actually blocking the extrusion reaction 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.459
 in the posterior anchorage is medical though 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.019
 extremely diminished 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:30.370
 thanks to the greater number of possible rays 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.769
 effect also make a fold 45 degrees 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.840
 then posterior region so that 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.209
 viewed from the front this spring exhibits a 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.629
 90 degree angle 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.269
 on the other hand, when observing the 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.330
 Bracket force applied to the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.819
 some distance from the resistance center 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.799
 the traction will take a moment if 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.290
 translated by an average invested 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.569
 sick conversion 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.930
 logically unwanted movement to 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.200
 this we do in the canine section a 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.109
 fold in 45 degrees for the same as if 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.220
 was to provoke a universal average 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.500
 no med canceling that pointed sequel 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.890
 the same reasoning applies to the segment 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.840
 posteriorly and when it is on top of the ball 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.060
 presents its ends with 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.789
 90 degree angulation 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.639
 these are the possible activations in this 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:29.070
 spring meaning I should not be 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.810
 all applied concomitantly 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.060
 a way to improve control of 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.750
 torque movement in the path is to 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.530
 one button per palatino uniting with fields 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.919
 elastic or accessory tumor 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.650
 Let's now turn to step-by-step making 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:05:51.400
 from the ball to zero 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:05:51.400
