00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.689
 attention this method of route you do it 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.490
 Under your responsibility I also tell you 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.849
 that if you perform the same steps as me 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.349
 you will not have any problem but 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.270
 We all know youtube welcome to 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.789
 this mobile I in which we will see how 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.890
 withdraw any Chinese terminal worth 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.949
 say the ones that do not matter and the brand and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.379
 the model of the mobile that we are going to use 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.150
 and also tell you that they can perform 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.250
 this process with different phones 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.230
 different brands what do I mean with 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.670
 this you can perform this method with 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.520
 any phone with operating system 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.590
 android is I worth doing this process 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.539
 with a phone in chinese jia and urge 4 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.489
 okay I'll show currently not 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.300
 I have it rooted with the Mapuche pro 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.129
 let's verify root access and you see that 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.920
 he tells us that we do not currently have his 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.629
 route and our terminal is valid for 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.479
 start rotating the phone we should go 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.759
 to adjustments and options 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.100
 developer enable debugging 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.560
 this step would be very important if you see 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.780
 that you do not have developer options 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.729
 here and it says phone information and the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.860
 compilation number we will press several 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.020
 times 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 if I would activate you watching here from 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.410
 developer options we go to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.700
 computer on the computer you download 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.340
 is the program that I leave in the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.230
 description of the video is worth a link with 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.930
 this program uploaded to mediafire is worth 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.290
 when the races install it and what 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.979
 open once the turama open we see 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.820
 that asks us to connect the phone 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 in this case I'm going to pick up the phone 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.300
 and I will connect it once connected the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.910
 phone we see that it recognizes us if it is 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.710
 the case that you do not have the drivers 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.710
 installed the same program os 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.780
 will install the phone drivers a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.880
 once installed the drivers will offer you 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.700
 this screen where we will press root and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 the phone will start to reuters 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 root bind interfaces 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.400
 and the phone would start to reuters I'm going to 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.770
 pass the video good the truth that the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.099
 This process is very fast and we see that in 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.440
 this case tells us that the terminal is 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.790
 successfully rooted that is going to 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.840
 restart as you see here I have 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 for all the Lord 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.170
 n 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.630
 if you were not starting the phone 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.710
 already with the active super user we are going to 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.430
 see good once 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.800
 once rooted you see that already here we 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.860
 ask superuser root permissions 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.510
 in this case I'm going to accept so 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.730
 which we already had rooted our 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 phone tell you that the bruce app 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.230
 This program is increasingly not 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.890
 meeting is this here is valid 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.050
 that 's what would replace the program 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.180
 superuser but we would have access 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.239
 root to teach them I'll go to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.580
 chiquero rice I will give in verify 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.830
 access route and we see that it puts 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.260
 congratulations your terminal is already 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.280
 rooted we would already have our phone 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.320
 Chinese or our android phone already 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 rooted if this method has served you 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.440
 remember to subscribe to give you the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.440
 comment and until next time
