about<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.750> i'm<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.049> talking<00:01:52.380> about<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.740> NHL

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
about this i'm not talking about for NHL

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.550 
about this i'm not talking about for NHL
13<00:01:53.100> maybe<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.540> another<00:01:54.780> game<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> future

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
13 maybe for another game in the future

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
13 maybe for another game in the future
but<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.759> should<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.060> some

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
but do you think they should have some

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.030 
but do you think they should have some
sort<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.540> booting<00:01:57.990> system<00:01:58.380> during<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
sort of booting system during the game I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
sort of booting system during the game I
mean<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.520> maybe<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.600> thinking<00:02:00.899> about<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
mean it maybe I was thinking about it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
mean it maybe I was thinking about it
maybe<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> majority<00:02:02.130> vote<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.610> boot

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
maybe like a majority vote to boot

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.370 
maybe like a majority vote to boot
somebody<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> flip<00:02:03.990> side<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
somebody but then the flip side of that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.440 
somebody but then the flip side of that
is<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> make<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.820> mistake<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
is you know you make one mistake and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240 
is you know you make one mistake and
everybody<00:02:06.840> will<00:02:06.930> jump<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.590> people

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
everybody will jump on you and people

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.680 
everybody will jump on you and people
just<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.550> booting<00:02:08.879> people<00:02:09.149> left<00:02:09.330> right<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
just be booting people left right and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.770 
just be booting people left right and
center<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.849> also<00:02:12.000> thinking<00:02:12.150> maybe<00:02:12.569> is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
center but I was also thinking maybe is

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
center but I was also thinking maybe is
there<00:02:12.959> some<00:02:13.170> way<00:02:13.200> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
there some way that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
there some way that
you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.830> quit<00:02:14.160> without<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.580> affecting<00:02:14.700> your

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
you can quit without it affecting your

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.970 
you can quit without it affecting your
stats<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.690> giving<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> dnf<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:16.800> look

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
stats or giving you a dnf because look

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.250 
stats or giving you a dnf because look
at<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.430> can't<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.150> anything<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:19.140> know

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
at this I can't do anything you know

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.580 
at this I can't do anything you know
maybe<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> quit<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.760> next<00:02:21.120> five<00:02:21.360> games

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
maybe you quit and the next five games

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.800 
maybe you quit and the next five games
you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.769> don't<00:02:23.010> get<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.510> record<00:02:24.510> stats

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
or something like that or the next three

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.280 
or something like that or the next three
games<00:02:26.099> are<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.910> no<00:02:27.390> games<00:02:27.720> where<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.050> stats

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
