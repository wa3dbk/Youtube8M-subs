00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.430
 old brazilian way 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.270
 gave the country its first feature film in three dimensions 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.870
 Animated brazil 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.009
 postulating the opening of roads they two characters in search of the tree 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.009
 oldest of brazil the great jequitibá 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 since last year brazil voted 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 by the laws of california 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.310
 right now 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.690
 these two friendly dogs are traveling through Brazil looking for the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.570
 oldest country tree the greatest favorite 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.240
 according to the infraero will pay ticket to see them or marvel after two 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.950
 days of delay 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.670
 goose to the mass of the unmarried situation 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 in addition it is expected to exercise are protagonists of the first 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.000
 animation in 3d tupiniquim is the long animated brazil 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.259
 Brazil is much better known 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.560
 the canavarro appeal for football 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.820
 ellen asked for lensherr 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.710
 so you keep imagining 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.830
 the movie we showed football here in the same story, right? 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.720
 amazon on the island rio de janeiro-são paulo south 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 is so rich 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.860
 and when I look at it I think 'ours started in several countries within 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.530
 a ford k 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.760
 when talking about the rate 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.440
 this is one more difficulty 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.220
 the risk is very good moment and an almost documentary character the film brings 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 still another novelty the mixture of real scenes with animation 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 and all this can be seen in three dimensions aquino computers have the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.480
 ease of flat videos like we want 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.990
 so we can take, for example. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.220
 the head of the character wave type further forward the body further back the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.939
 theft of objects so deep 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.349
 arrives very deep and this theme in a way that looks good so mark 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.620
 stylized bittman 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.490
 nana in the depth and then as we work with these cameras they 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.500
 ended up doing everything 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.639
 the ubs of tignes work will kill itself few agents 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.899
 has one eye catch a point of view the other eye took another point of view 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.310
 that ends up flowing 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.349
 the 3d image the technique increasingly present between super productions 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.680
 north american 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.300
 already beginning to appear here and today can also be found in several 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.970
 formats so it 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.840
 advertising like this one can see in the movies can see on the internet if possible 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.999
 did not have time to see your home 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.989
 now a print media for each type of wine, 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.969
 a different instrument then if you saw on the internet and a normal computer 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.529
 if not we go to the 1 500 units the announcement in a future already I ask 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.569
 protection, according to professionals in the area, the scenario of 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.929
 Brazilian production in 3d is very promising 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.019
 and with the advancement of technology 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.930
 this format might get more and more popular I think this will try to play 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.720
 very 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.880
 the plates of the world the people now independent of the brand 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.360
 all of them not only excited the sporting and 3d 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.390
 because for them it is very simple this is after it is or not to buy a glasses 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.060
 but then there's not going to be any later, but then 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.489
 having the possibility of growing up was in space 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.849
 I think this will help in the production in the year of government the technician 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.499
 5 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.029
 even the cock 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.629
 end of the season waiting for you
