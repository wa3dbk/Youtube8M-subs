cuz be honest I have the feeling but
given<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.049> sufficient<00:01:08.560> airplay<00:01:09.040> right

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
given the sufficient airplay right

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.359 
given the sufficient airplay right
throughout<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.700> country<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.590> video<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.250> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
throughout the country the video of the

throughout the country the video of the
sound<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.820> records<00:01:13.270> could<00:01:13.810> well<00:01:13.990> them

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
sound of the records could well them

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.490 
sound of the records could well them

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
give it a a top three status I mean I I

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.020 
give it a a top three status I mean I I
think<00:01:18.009> it's<00:01:18.159> I<00:01:18.399> think<00:01:18.429> it's<00:01:18.670> what<00:01:18.819> it's<00:01:18.939> all

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
think it's I think it's what it's all

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.230 
think it's I think it's what it's all
about<00:01:19.090> today<00:01:19.569> I<00:01:20.639> still<00:01:21.639> don't<00:01:21.819> understand

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
about today I still don't understand

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480 
about today I still don't understand
exactly<00:01:22.420> what<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.810> saw<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.109> what<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.289> heard<00:01:23.490> do

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
exactly what I saw and what I heard do

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.580 
exactly what I saw and what I heard do
you<00:01:24.579> think<00:01:24.819> you<00:01:25.030> see<00:01:25.179> what<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.359> what<00:01:25.659> I<00:01:25.689> feel<00:01:26.079> is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
you think you see what I what I feel is

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.340 
you think you see what I what I feel is
but<00:01:27.520> with<00:01:27.670> sufficient<00:01:27.850> airplay<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:29.049> could

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
but with sufficient airplay this could

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.260 
but with sufficient airplay this could
be<00:01:29.499> a<00:01:29.530> hit<00:01:29.829> do<00:01:30.399> you<00:01:30.490> think<00:01:30.700> that's<00:01:30.850> all<00:01:30.969> I<00:01:31.030> can

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
be a hit do you think that's all I can

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.309 
be a hit do you think that's all I can
serve<00:01:31.450> do<00:01:31.569> you<00:01:31.630> think<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:31.929> true<00:01:32.109> of<00:01:32.139> any

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
serve do you think that's true of any

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.809 
serve do you think that's true of any
rep<00:01:32.499> but<00:01:32.590> if<00:01:32.709> it<00:01:32.829> gets<00:01:32.889> played<00:01:33.189> a<00:01:33.219> lot<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.729> will

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
rep but if it gets played a lot it will

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.489 
rep but if it gets played a lot it will
be<00:01:33.999> a<00:01:34.030> hit<00:01:34.240> no<00:01:34.329> not<00:01:34.509> necessarily<00:01:34.990> because<00:01:35.380> you

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
be a hit no not necessarily because you

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:36.809 
be a hit no not necessarily because you
because<00:01:35.859> you<00:01:35.950> could<00:01:36.100> play<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.249> record<00:01:36.459> but<00:01:36.670> it's

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
because you could play a record but it's

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.910 
because you could play a record but it's
very<00:01:36.939> uninteresting<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.569> lot<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.499> turn<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
very uninteresting a lot and turn the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.609 
very uninteresting a lot and turn the
public<00:01:39.249> off<00:01:39.429> it<00:01:39.670> forever<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.359> in<00:01:41.200> fact<00:01:41.469> you

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
public off it forever and in fact you

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.679 
public off it forever and in fact you
know<00:01:41.740> by<00:01:41.889> playing<00:01:42.189> by<00:01:42.579> playing<00:01:42.880> what<00:01:43.359> is<00:01:43.509> a

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
know by playing by playing what is a

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.410 
know by playing by playing what is a
pretty<00:01:44.020> ordinary<00:01:44.200> record<00:01:44.709> by<00:01:44.859> an<00:01:44.979> artist<00:01:45.459> you

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
pretty ordinary record by an artist you

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.609 
pretty ordinary record by an artist you
can<00:01:46.569> actually<00:01:46.719> ruin<00:01:47.109> their<00:01:47.350> follow<00:01:47.560> up

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
can actually ruin their follow up

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.129 
can actually ruin their follow up
chances<00:01:48.219> because<00:01:49.119> people<00:01:49.479> sometimes<00:01:49.990> think

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
chances because people sometimes think

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.069 
chances because people sometimes think
oh<00:01:50.259> there's<00:01:50.499> a<00:01:50.560> new<00:01:50.709> record<00:01:50.950> by<00:01:51.249> X<00:01:51.579> okay<00:01:52.420> but

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
oh there's a new record by X okay but

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.629 
oh there's a new record by X okay but
the<00:01:53.170> last<00:01:53.319> one<00:01:53.529> was<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.679> good<00:01:53.889> bit<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.279> lot<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
the last one was a good bit a lot of

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.059 
the last one was a good bit a lot of
rubbish<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.209> I've<00:01:56.139> I<00:01:56.499> don't<00:01:56.619> even<00:01:56.920> want<00:01:57.039> to

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
rubbish and I've I don't even want to

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.190 
rubbish and I've I don't even want to
know<00:01:57.189> about<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.520> one<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.240> you've<00:01:58.929> got<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.139> be

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
know about this one so you've got to be

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.019 
know about this one so you've got to be
very<00:01:59.229> careful<00:01:59.709> about<00:01:59.799> that<00:01:59.920> but<00:02:00.279> but

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:01.029 
very careful about that but but

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.629 
very careful about that but but
underlying<00:02:01.539> factions<00:02:02.529> tell<00:02:02.829> me<00:02:03.069> that<00:02:03.459> that

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
underlying factions tell me that that

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.089 
underlying factions tell me that that
could<00:02:03.789> be<00:02:03.849> a<00:02:03.969> hit<00:02:04.119> record<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:05.099> don't

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
could be a hit record I don't

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.279 
could be a hit record I don't
particularly<00:02:06.429> like<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.999> but

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
particularly like it but

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.710 
particularly like it but
yes<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.519> good<00:02:09.700> enough<00:02:09.939> in<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.360> indie
