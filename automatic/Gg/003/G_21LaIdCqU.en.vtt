00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.220 
fairing on Mason we're going to clip
these<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.829> bottom<00:00:50.160> pieces<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:51.329> underneath

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
these two bottom pieces here underneath

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
these two bottom pieces here underneath
to<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> other<00:00:52.980> fairing<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.610> we're<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.670 
to the other fairing and we're going to
do<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> using<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
do that using these I think the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
do that using these I think the
technical<00:00:56.010> term<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.340> doohickey<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.989> basically

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
technical term is doohickey it basically

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
technical term is doohickey it basically
it<00:00:58.829> goes<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.489> then<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> screw

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it goes up in there and then you screw

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.979 
it goes up in there and then you screw
it<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.300> tighten<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.690> oh<00:01:01.010> here<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.039> go<00:01:02.719> okay<00:01:03.719> now

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it to tighten it oh here we go okay now

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.539 
it to tighten it oh here we go okay now
that<00:01:04.140> we've<00:01:04.260> gotten<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.890> side<00:01:05.100> fairing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
on we we connected this light here to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.200 
on we we connected this light here to
the<00:01:09.470> wiring<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> inside<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:12.000> this

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the wiring on the inside got this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.990 
the wiring on the inside got this
triangle<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.320> inserted<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.850> all

here<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:05.630> got<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> make<00:02:05.960> sure<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.409> this

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
here you got to make sure that this

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.240 
here you got to make sure that this
electronics<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.970> brace<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.750> guess<00:02:09.050> fits<00:02:09.979> right

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
electronics a brace I guess fits right

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.000 
electronics a brace I guess fits right
on<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.880> little<00:02:11.060> piece<00:02:11.330> there<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:12.560> think

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
on that little piece there I think

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.140 
on that little piece there I think
that's<00:02:13.130> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> be<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.520> trickiest<00:02:13.819> part

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
that's going to be the trickiest part

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.520 
that's going to be the trickiest part
and<00:02:14.360> then<00:02:14.569> once<00:02:14.750> we're<00:02:14.959> done<00:02:15.080> we're<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.470> to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and then once we're done we're going to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.520 
and then once we're done we're going to
bolt<00:02:16.250> everything<00:02:16.940> onto<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.870> bike<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.380> we're

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
bolt everything onto the bike and we're

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.130 
bolt everything onto the bike and we're
going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> put<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.420> wind<00:02:20.420> screen<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:21.019> as

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
going to put the wind screen on there as

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.440 
going to put the wind screen on there as
well<00:02:21.519> okay<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.820> took<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:22.970> little<00:02:23.060> bit<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.360> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
well okay so it took a little bit of a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.240 
well okay so it took a little bit of a
new<00:02:23.630> ring<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.019> we<00:02:24.110> finally<00:02:24.350> got<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.650> front

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
new ring but we finally got the front

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.440 
new ring but we finally got the front
carrying<00:02:25.550> on<00:02:25.670> now<00:02:25.880> we're<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.030> going<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.300> put

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
carrying on now we're just going to put

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.930 
carrying on now we're just going to put
the<00:02:26.630> wind<00:02:27.290> screen<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.540> pretty<00:02:29.989> simply

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the wind screen that is pretty simply

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.940 
the wind screen that is pretty simply
like<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:34.090> we're<00:02:35.090> almost<00:02:35.269> done<00:02:35.690> okay<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:36.440> in

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
like so and we're almost done okay so in

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.680 
like so and we're almost done okay so in
order<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.220> stick<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.820> rear<00:02:38.000> indicators<00:02:38.540> on

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
order to stick the rear indicators on

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.880 
order to stick the rear indicators on
with<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> body<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.320> bike<00:02:39.500> we're<00:02:39.709> going<00:02:39.830> to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
with the body of the bike we're going to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.890 
with the body of the bike we're going to
use<00:02:40.010> some<00:02:40.130> industrial-strength

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
use some industrial-strength

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.100 
use some industrial-strength
double-sided<00:02:41.900> tape<00:02:42.260> simple<00:02:43.010> as<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.810> ok<00:02:44.810> cool

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
double-sided tape simple as that ok cool
