00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.930 
harmonica made by Homer this little box
as<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:11.219> can<00:00:11.250> see<00:00:11.580> has<00:00:11.820> not<00:00:11.969> been<00:00:12.150> opened<00:00:12.380> so

as you can see has not been opened so
I'm<00:00:14.940> gonna<00:00:15.150> open<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.660> don't<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.139> know

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
I'm gonna open it I don't actually know

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.380 
I'm gonna open it I don't actually know
what's<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.720> let's<00:00:18.720> find<00:00:18.990> out

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
what's in this for this let's find out

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.320 
what's in this for this let's find out
live<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.600> air<00:00:21.840> rid<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:26.090> how<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.180> open

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
live on air rid of that how do you open

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.770 
live on air rid of that how do you open
this<00:00:27.449> whoa<00:00:28.310> there<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.340> go<00:00:29.519> beautiful<00:00:32.780> Steven

this whoa there you go beautiful Steven
Tyler<00:00:34.219> signature<00:00:35.219> he's<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> guy<00:00:36.059> from

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
Tyler signature he's the guy from

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.740 
Tyler signature he's the guy from
Aerosmith<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:38.059> think<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.210> quite<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> few<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
Aerosmith I think there's quite a few of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.530 
Aerosmith I think there's quite a few of
his<00:00:40.020> solos<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.100> YouTube<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:42.149> you'd<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
his solos on YouTube if you'd like to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.080 
his solos on YouTube if you'd like to
see<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.430> he's<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> guy<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.730> wears<00:00:45.000> the

leopard skin or whatever skin trousers I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
leopard skin or whatever skin trousers I
think<00:00:48.110> right<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.010> let's<00:00:51.170> get

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think right what do we got let's get

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:04.060 
think right what do we got let's get
this<00:00:53.149> box<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.760> box<00:00:58.789> there's<00:00:59.789> the

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.890 

harmonica<00:01:05.070> box<00:01:05.220> itself<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:06.240> oh<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.780> are

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
harmonica box itself that's oh these are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.420 
harmonica box itself that's oh these are
in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> key<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.710> realized

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.770 

presumably<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.180> plays<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> lot

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
presumably that's because he plays a lot

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.670 
presumably that's because he plays a lot
in<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.340> using<00:01:14.340> an<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> harmonica<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in it using an a harmonica so that this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.450 
in it using an a harmonica so that this
looks<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.630> standard<00:01:18.630> sort<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.460> modular

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
looks like a standard sort of modular

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.620 
looks like a standard sort of modular
series<00:01:24.770> harmonica<00:01:25.770> alright<00:01:26.159> there<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.430> goes

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
series harmonica alright there it goes

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.859 
series harmonica alright there it goes
looks<00:01:27.630> nice<00:01:27.780> doesn't<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:29.570> let's<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.720> his

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
looks nice doesn't it let's go his

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.810 
looks nice doesn't it let's go his
signature<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.259> 10<00:01:31.619> hole<00:01:31.799> diatonic<00:01:32.430> key<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
signature on 10 hole diatonic key of a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.950 
signature on 10 hole diatonic key of a
modular<00:01:35.820> series<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.479> replace<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
modular series so you can replace the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.030 
modular series so you can replace the
cover<00:01:37.079> plates<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> comb<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.509> reedplates<00:01:40.040> any

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
cover plates the comb the reedplates any

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.850 
cover plates the comb the reedplates any
of<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:42.229> made<00:01:43.229> by<00:01:43.380> Homer<00:01:45.470> don't<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.649> where

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
of it made by Homer don't know where

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.340 
of it made by Homer don't know where
perhaps<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.520> Germany<00:01:47.880> perhaps<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.869> China<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
perhaps in Germany perhaps in China I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
perhaps in Germany perhaps in China I
don't<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.130> tells<00:01:50.640> us<00:01:52.369> now<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
don't think it tells us now that's it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:10.990 
don't think it tells us now that's it
now<00:01:54.090> let's<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:55.020> ready<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.710> how<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.890> sounds

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:46.400 

yes<00:02:12.000> kind<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.840> burglar<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.350> little<00:02:13.560> bit<00:02:45.380> yeah

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
yes kind of a burglar a little bit yeah

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.290 
yes kind of a burglar a little bit yeah
not<00:02:46.920> too<00:02:47.040> bad<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.390> they<00:02:48.510> go<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.350> Steven<00:02:49.890> Tyler

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
not too bad so they go the Steven Tyler

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.320 
not too bad so they go the Steven Tyler
signature<00:02:51.470> harmonica<00:02:52.470> series<00:02:53.150> see<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:54.270> you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
signature harmonica series see what you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.310
