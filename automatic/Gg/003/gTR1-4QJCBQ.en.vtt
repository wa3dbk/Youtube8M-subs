case let's start the very beginning

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670 
case let's start the very beginning
let's<00:01:52.860> start<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:54.110> taking<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.320> chunk<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
let's start up with taking a chunk of

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.040 
let's start up with taking a chunk of
for<00:01:57.670> example<00:01:58.090> putting<00:01:58.330> out<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.630> crafting

for example putting out on a crafting
table<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.910> cubit<00:02:01.390> measure<00:02:01.980> which<00:02:02.980> I<00:02:03.070> put<00:02:03.250> on

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
table and a cubit measure which I put on

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.030 
table and a cubit measure which I put on
that<00:02:03.430> crafting<00:02:03.820> table<00:02:04.180> as<00:02:04.330> well<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:05.890> when

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
that crafting table as well and now when

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
also now my time I catch err I might

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.030 
also now my time I catch err I might
want<00:02:21.970> some<00:02:22.120> wooden<00:02:22.360> poles<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.990> have<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.530> shortcut

want some wooden poles I have a shortcut
I<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.459> since<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.880> know<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.270> recipe<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.930> can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
I can do since I know that recipe I can

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.270 
I can do since I know that recipe I can
just<00:02:26.380> click<00:02:26.680> directly<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.480> recipe<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.410> my

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
just click directly on the recipe in my

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.060 
just click directly on the recipe in my
recipe<00:02:30.520> book<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.120> those<00:02:31.810> items<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> would

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
recipe book and those items that I would

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.620 
recipe book and those items that I would
use<00:02:33.310> are<00:02:33.730> directly<00:02:34.000> put<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.270> there<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.510> this

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
use are directly put out there in this

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.650 
use are directly put out there in this
case<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.020> wood<00:02:35.260> rasp<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:36.280> board<00:02:36.640> are<00:02:37.090> used

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
case is a wood rasp and a board are used

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.540 
case is a wood rasp and a board are used
to<00:02:37.870> turn<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.709> board<00:02:39.550> into<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.560> round<00:02:41.560> wooden<00:02:42.250> leg

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
to turn a board into a round wooden leg

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.800 
to turn a board into a round wooden leg
so<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.820> can<00:02:42.850> craft<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:44.530> as<00:02:44.800> well<00:02:45.270> if<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.660> goes

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
so I can craft that as well if it goes

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.320 
so I can craft that as well if it goes
up<00:02:46.989> off<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.440> off<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.040> milling<00:02:48.489> station<00:02:48.880> and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
up off the off the milling station and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.540 
up off the off the milling station and
now<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.020> can<00:02:50.260> take<00:02:50.470> those<00:02:50.650> from<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.280> milling

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
now I can take those from the milling

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.530 
now I can take those from the milling
station<00:02:51.940> over<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.540> carpentry

I<00:03:56.670> now<00:03:56.909> have<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.510> chair<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.170> my<00:03:58.319> inventory<00:03:58.680> as

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
I now have a chair in my inventory as

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.399 
I now have a chair in my inventory as
well<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.090> now<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.209> can<00:04:00.329> take<00:04:00.629> that<00:04:00.810> chair

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
well and so now I can take that chair

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.589 
well and so now I can take that chair
and<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:02.370> want<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.579> get<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.730> player<00:04:02.969> house<00:04:03.180> i<00:04:03.450> can

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
and I want to get a player house i can

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.160 
and I want to get a player house i can
go<00:04:03.750> set<00:04:04.379> that<00:04:04.530> tear<00:04:04.739> down<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.879> that<00:04:06.150> house<00:04:06.420> but

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
go set that tear down in that house but

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.619 
go set that tear down in that house but
that<00:04:07.290> same<00:04:07.500> process<00:04:07.769> works<00:04:08.280> with<00:04:08.519> all<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:09.299> the

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
that same process works with all of the

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.410 
that same process works with all of the
other<00:04:10.340> things<00:04:11.340> i<00:04:11.430> want<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:11.939> like<00:04:12.180> for

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
other things i want to do like for

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.259 
other things i want to do like for
example<00:04:12.480> here<00:04:12.959> let<00:04:13.049> me<00:04:13.109> come<00:04:13.260> over<00:04:13.439> to<00:04:13.620> this

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
example here let me come over to this

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.090 
example here let me come over to this
smelting<00:04:15.269> station<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.959> then<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> smelting

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
smelting station and then the smelting

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.569 
smelting station and then the smelting
station<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.820> where<00:04:18.209> i<00:04:18.239> will<00:04:18.780> be<00:04:18.989> able<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.579> melt

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
station is where i will be able to melt

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.689 
station is where i will be able to melt
down<00:04:20.910> ors<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:22.019> make<00:04:22.310> ingots<00:04:23.310> bars<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.509> wire

other kinds of of activities and so fact
if<00:04:32.130> i<00:04:32.220> go<00:04:32.430> over<00:04:32.460> here<00:04:32.729> too<00:04:33.000> let's<00:04:33.660> see<00:04:33.780> if<00:04:33.840> I

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
if i go over here too let's see if I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.020 
if i go over here too let's see if I
have<00:04:34.050> any<00:04:34.080> smelting<00:04:34.949> where's<00:04:35.400> my<00:04:35.580> smelting

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
have any smelting where's my smelting

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.700 
have any smelting where's my smelting
that<00:04:36.750> brings<00:04:36.930> me<00:04:36.990> something<00:04:37.229> there<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.590> a

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
that brings me something there is a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.879 
that brings me something there is a
synthetic<00:04:39.199> and<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.349> want<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.590> make<00:04:40.650> for

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
synthetic and so I want to make for

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.629 
synthetic and so I want to make for
example<00:04:41.280> an<00:04:41.340> iron<00:04:41.639> ingot<00:04:42.500> what<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.710> takes<00:04:44.520> me

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
example an iron ingot what that takes me

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.219 
example an iron ingot what that takes me
is<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.789> chunk<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.120> coal<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.449> can<00:04:45.930> be<00:04:46.080> brought

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
is a chunk of coal that can be brought

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.710 
is a chunk of coal that can be brought
back<00:04:46.500> from<00:04:46.740> miners<00:04:47.190> who<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.849> mines<00:04:48.509> and

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
back from miners who have the mines and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.140 
back from miners who have the mines and
bring<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.930> back<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.770> requires<00:04:50.130> an<00:04:50.310> ingot<00:04:50.759> mold

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
bring it back it requires an ingot mold

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.240 
bring it back it requires an ingot mold

over to a might require I actually don't

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.619 
over to a might require I actually don't
know<00:06:58.529> I've<00:06:58.710> never<00:06:58.740> made<00:06:59.069> one<00:06:59.219> yet<00:06:59.460> so<00:06:59.599> one<00:07:00.599> of

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:00.629 
know I've never made one yet so one of

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.360 
know I've never made one yet so one of
my<00:07:00.719> guess<00:07:01.050> is<00:07:01.259> that<00:07:01.289> I<00:07:01.529> need<00:07:01.680> to<00:07:01.830> get<00:07:01.949> some<00:07:02.099> oil

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
my guess is that I need to get some oil

my guess is that I need to get some oil
and<00:07:02.789> a<00:07:03.449> wick<00:07:03.689> and<00:07:03.930> maybe<00:07:04.289> make<00:07:04.469> the<00:07:04.589> oil

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
and a wick and maybe make the oil

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.219 
and a wick and maybe make the oil
reservoir<00:07:05.460> which<00:07:05.699> I<00:07:05.789> can<00:07:05.939> also<00:07:06.059> easily<00:07:06.960> make

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
reservoir which I can also easily make

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.110 
reservoir which I can also easily make
usually<00:07:07.559> I<00:07:07.620> think<00:07:07.919> like<00:07:08.039> sheets<00:07:08.249> of<00:07:08.430> metal<00:07:08.580> so

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120
