00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 once again about the logic of different modes of layers 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 your 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.210
 Sergey chat 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.610
 for 74. livejournal.com 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.560
 if you're talking about blending modes if anyone 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.119
 not laziness and the link is ready because 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.099
 this question always arises please 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.189
 discard it all overlay mode 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.199
 painted in detail this 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.850
 a very big topic i dedicated a whole 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.540
 advanced course is actually ok 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.540
 say if 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:48.010
 very fast blend mode 2 by 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.100
 several categories are normal 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.020
 blackout lightening contrast 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.809
 specialized and frontal rate and 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.300
 dessole is normal will not be here 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.489
 understandable let's say so just a picture 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.690
 deeson a very specific layer of us 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.910
 more interesting blackout 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.220
 brightening contrast daikin of two 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.619
 pixels picks darker overall 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.420
 render it well, kind of husky lowers 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.119
 white suit something new ranges 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.160
 loss of contrast color burn throws . 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.259
 black upwards contrast 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.840
 roasts photo mostly affected 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.750
 on dark dark degenerate black 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.460
 the contrast rises in the right 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.840
 parts of the tone range . white not 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.700
 touches liner burn 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.619
 produces parallel curve transfer 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.479
 move and point black and search white 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.049
 maintaining the contrast throughout the tone 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.500
 range 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.960
 darkly darker color the same darkin 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.729
 just for lobo light he does the same 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.140
 the most that dakine is just the opposite of two 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.939
 pixels superposed 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.280
 chooses its bright screen displays 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.540
 raises a black point with a loss 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.619
 contrast throughout the tonal range 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.450
 color daughter raises the point of white with 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.119
 increased contrast throughout the tone 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.680
 the range of the light areas go away do 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.880
 contrast rises on the plate 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.880
 social networks of this range 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 liner daughter in parallel carry the curve 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.450
 with elevation. black and white point 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.340
 Conservation of contrast throughout the new 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.170
 range light all court light or color 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.630
 the same as layknu only mode 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.250
 lab is probably a contrast blending mode 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.220
 touches not only anyway not 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.620
 the white suit of the main affects the average 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.660
 part of the ion range is valid by 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.019
 the principle of gamma correction that is arched 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.190
 This is the shape of the curve rounded 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.310
 softlight on average in hospital at two 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.300
 times weaker than overlay as it were 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.570
 nothing else 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.130
 and register and has more influence in the shadow 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.690
 common colors do not touch not tile 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.050
 black is not only white hardlight 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.370
 combination multipla and sincerely 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.160
 contrast blending mode for which 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.890
 is gray average average gray 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.440
 neutral color which is lightening 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 parts lighter than medium gray is a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.450
 ren load here is shading the new and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.850
 heat and believe light color combination 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 burn eye color dodge medium gray also 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.870
 neutral for the whole group of contrasting 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.490
 linear light blending modes 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.000
 godzilla northern liner combination 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.880
 open light combination dake no light on a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 hard mix honestly can not remember and displays 3 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.730
 Schools on all three channel difference 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.740
 calculates the channel difference between 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.200
 pixels if there is no difference puts zero 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.250
 then black if there is a difference 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.470
 put originated in which you number as 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.580
 read the abstract on the slopes 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.260
 Zhuravleva 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.290
 never in my life i use except with 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.600
 abstract a hill carry only shade 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.770
 not touching not chromatic not 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.140
 saturation is not 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.030
 Reishi's complexion is tolerated only 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.570
 saturation saturation parameter 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.550
 cola object is a combination of fine 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.780
 accordingly translates transferred both 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.330
 parameter and hue and saturation 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.150
 laziness and transfer to automatic 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.010
 part of the photo is all 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.080
 details from Andrei Zhuravlev I drive 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.080
 or on his courses base percent
