00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.299
 once a training course with Lars Nieberg riding for the winners of the VW Cup went 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.260
 this dream come true my colleague Holger Kern has the participants in the 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.259
 Training looked over his shoulder 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.060
 dpa 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.739
 so Aldi took seventh at first glance may also look like 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.499
 it is not 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.199
 the finalists of the Volkswagen Kaps have a special sports lesson 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.769
 her teacher is Lars Nieberg 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.170
 Since Volkswagen Cup is meanwhile the largest German airline has for 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.300
 Friday those with over one hundred six qualifying tournaments in all 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.280
 Germany 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.450
 qualify for six qualifying tournaments this month 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.150
 the best two leaders in show jumping and the best in dressage 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.050
 Riders for five semi-finals, for example in Münster or in 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.630
 Dresden 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.020
 There, the best riders lined up again to participate in the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.910
 Final in Brunswick 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.520
 the finale is integrated into the Löwen Classics which surely is one too 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.560
 great experience is for the riders then 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.430
 to start at the Löwen Classics 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.710
 there winters the best three 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.140
 refer to the third place winner for a winner weekend with Lars Nieberg 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.730
 in the jumping or in the forests 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.360
 in dressage I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised ship is percent 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 four riders here four amateurs but who are allowed 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.260
 look very good have the sun 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.540
 at the good m-level are and 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 very open-minded it is fun to work with them 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.440
 Generally, I always pay attention to it a bit 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.080
 that one on the butt and puts 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.030
 that the rider drives Last FM put that possible rhythm 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 then I pay special attention to every value 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.180
 Trying there was always going to be at Lanxess to improve that they are fair in the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.060
 Balance run independently 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 of Arrai's hand can move 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.370
 These are the basics 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.010
 pay special attention to the skis otherwise it is always quite difficult in 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.409
 three days 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.729
 if you do not know him endangering the riders 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.679
 and that's why I think PROMUS man a bit 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:21.189
 Always keep an eye on the base and then, next to it, there is the reason 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 and that they run for all time 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.959
 With such a trailer, thieves are twice as much fun 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.499
 and everything is in flight 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.700
 After the jump, there are also a few useful tips from the jumping professional 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.119
 want 2 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 United 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.929
 he regretted that he was dead 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.619
 Citizens receive 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.039
 I'm here with a six-year-old gelding 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.229
 Ban let his name 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.199
 is purely Hanover supports saxony-anhaltiner Brand is this year 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.679
 gone his first season 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.519
 and we have a very uneven showdown with Minsk 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.419
 because this is sometimes a bit hard to gather around and to me 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.819
 has that and some problems in the distances 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.929
 Henning the Karbener helped a lot and has more weeks 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.839
 Mix better and where I can raise in the bank speech and 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.459
 we'll be working on it over winter hoping it will be next year 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:27.859
 rebreak
