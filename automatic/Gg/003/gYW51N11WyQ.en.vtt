00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that is that prior to this point the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.970 
that is that prior to this point the
average<00:00:19.320> mission<00:00:20.310> zone<00:00:20.910> area<00:00:21.510> took<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:22.260> 15

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

different missions owns over and over
again<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.960> 15<00:00:37.920> minutes<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.399> pop<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.030> average<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
again at 15 minutes a pop on average and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that's just that's eight hours of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and over again albeit they do get a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.479 
and over again albeit they do get a
little<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.120> difficult<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.280> there's<00:00:53.280> like

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
little more difficult and there's like

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
little more difficult and there's like
different<00:00:53.670> objectives<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.539> try<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> die

but the fact of the matter is these

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.289 
but the fact of the matter is these
first<00:01:03.809> eight<00:01:04.019> hours<00:01:04.409> were<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.010> these

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
first eight hours were in these

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
first eight hours were in these
incredibly<00:01:06.299> small<00:01:06.659> areas<00:01:07.200> some<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.950> larger

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
incredibly small areas some are larger

incredibly small areas some are larger
than<00:01:08.490> others<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.750> linear<00:01:10.110> path<00:01:10.380> first

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
than others but it's a linear path first

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
than others but it's a linear path first
of<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.430> were<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.729> linear<00:01:12.150> paths

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
forest in amongst those first eight

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.730 
forest in amongst those first eight
hours<00:02:30.810> i<00:02:30.990> think<00:02:31.020> i<00:02:31.290> would<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.530> had<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> much

going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.049> get<00:03:25.170> turned<00:03:25.590> off<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.220> probably<00:03:26.640> shy

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
going to get turned off and probably shy

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.060 
going to get turned off and probably shy
away<00:03:27.600> from<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.049> game<00:03:28.260> within<00:03:28.470> those<00:03:28.739> first

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
away from the game within those first

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.270 
away from the game within those first
couple<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.580> hours<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.860> experienced<00:03:31.860> just<00:03:31.950> could

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
couple of hours I experienced just could

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.080 
couple of hours I experienced just could
be<00:03:32.310> infinitely<00:03:32.970> better<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.540> my<00:03:33.959> opinion<00:03:33.989> if

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
be infinitely better in my opinion if

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.850 
be infinitely better in my opinion if
something<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.360> lamber<00:03:36.930> forced<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.680> not

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
something like lamber forced if it's not

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.680 
something like lamber forced if it's not
just<00:03:38.070> lamber<00:03:38.430> force<00:03:38.670> itself<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.360> mean<00:03:39.510> maybe

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
just lamber force itself I mean maybe

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.960 
just lamber force itself I mean maybe
they<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:39.989> rework<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.530> story<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.100> just<00:03:41.670> throw

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
they can rework the story and just throw

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.600 
they can rework the story and just throw
lamber<00:03:42.360> forest<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.769> first<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.459> know

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
lamber forest in in the first you know

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.940 
lamber forest in in the first you know
two<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.330> three<00:03:45.600> hours<00:03:45.630> instead<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.470> having<00:03:46.799> to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
two to three hours instead of having to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.490 
two to three hours instead of having to
wait<00:03:47.250> eight<00:03:47.519> hours<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.090> progression<00:03:48.989> doing

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
wait eight hours of progression doing

the same six missions over and over

the same six missions over and over
again<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.230> I'm<00:03:52.320> being<00:03:53.040> repetitive

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
again and I know I'm being repetitive

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.370 
again and I know I'm being repetitive
here<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.030> video<00:03:54.360> but<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:54.989> no<00:03:55.170> more

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
here in this video but it is no more

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.130 
here in this video but it is no more
repetitive<00:03:55.890> than<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.790> game<00:03:57.000> itself<00:03:57.140> becomes

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
repetitive than the game itself becomes

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.860 
repetitive than the game itself becomes
in<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.920> initial<00:03:59.430> experience<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.420> yes<00:04:00.660> if

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
in that initial experience and yes if

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.600 
in that initial experience and yes if
you<00:04:01.320> talk<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.709> anyone<00:04:02.130> who's<00:04:02.340> played<00:04:02.489> a

significant amount of MMOs they will all

tell you it takes a while to get into
the<00:04:07.650> meat<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.950> these<00:04:08.400> games<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:09.000> really<00:04:09.299> have

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
the meat of these games you really have

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.660 
the meat of these games you really have
to<00:04:09.630> progress<00:04:09.780> your<00:04:09.930> characters<00:04:10.530> level<00:04:10.829> up<00:04:11.130> but

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
to progress your characters level up but

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.220 
to progress your characters level up but
you<00:04:11.820> know<00:04:11.940> as<00:04:12.150> they<00:04:12.329> say<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.570> have<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.870> wait<00:04:13.079> to

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
you know as they say you have to wait to

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.259 
you know as they say you have to wait to
the<00:04:13.260> end<00:04:13.380> game<00:04:13.709> before<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.190> can<00:04:14.640> really<00:04:14.820> judge

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
the end game before you can really judge

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.270 
the end game before you can really judge
it<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.720> doesn't<00:04:16.049> take<00:04:16.380> away<00:04:16.410> from<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.040> fact

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
it that doesn't take away from the fact

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.520 
it that doesn't take away from the fact
that<00:04:17.459> first<00:04:17.790> impressions<00:04:18.359> are<00:04:18.570> important

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
that first impressions are important

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.949 
that first impressions are important
that<00:04:19.979> they<00:04:20.190> do<00:04:20.250> matter<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.479> think<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that they do matter and I think that the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.839 
that they do matter and I think that the
first<00:04:22.109> impression<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.099> game<00:04:23.370> could<00:04:23.700> be

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
first impression of this game could be

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.240 
first impression of this game could be
infinitely<00:04:24.419> better<00:04:24.690> than<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.500> in<00:04:25.800> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
infinitely better than it is in the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.780 
infinitely better than it is in the
current<00:04:26.729> way<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.240> its<00:04:27.450> strong

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
current way that its strong

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.280 
current way that its strong
shirt<00:04:28.000> honestly<00:04:28.480> I'll<00:04:28.690> break<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.050> down

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
shirt honestly I'll break it down

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.650 
shirt honestly I'll break it down
exactly<00:04:29.830> for<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.220> how<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.610> works<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:31.390> first

picking up questions I go similar to
like<00:05:30.730> how<00:05:30.850> guild<00:05:31.150> wars<00:05:31.360> 2<00:05:31.570> works<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:32.200> was<00:05:32.560> great

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
like how guild wars 2 works it was great

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.190 
like how guild wars 2 works it was great
and<00:05:33.250> it<00:05:33.340> felt<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:33.880> much<00:05:34.090> better<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.720> you<00:05:35.080> know

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
and it felt so much better and you know

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.350 
and it felt so much better and you know
again<00:05:35.440> as<00:05:35.800> always<00:05:36.010> this<00:05:36.490> stuff<00:05:36.790> is<00:05:37.000> from<00:05:37.150> my

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
again as always this stuff is from my

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.960 
again as always this stuff is from my
perspective<00:05:37.810> it's<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.950> my<00:05:39.220> personal

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
perspective it's just my personal

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.570 
perspective it's just my personal
opinion<00:05:40.260> it's<00:05:41.260> okay<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.710> have<00:05:42.040> a<00:05:42.070> game<00:05:42.400> that's

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
opinion it's okay to have a game that's

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.070 
opinion it's okay to have a game that's
like<00:05:42.790> an<00:05:42.940> action<00:05:43.330> game<00:05:43.480> with<00:05:43.720> these<00:05:43.870> little

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
like an action game with these little

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.750 
like an action game with these little
chunks<00:05:44.620> but<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.830> have<00:05:44.920> it<00:05:45.100> be<00:05:45.220> so<00:05:45.430> repetitive

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
chunks but to have it be so repetitive

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.750 
chunks but to have it be so repetitive
and<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.570> hold<00:05:46.780> back<00:05:47.080> this<00:05:47.760> phenomenally

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
and to hold back this phenomenally

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.490 
and to hold back this phenomenally
looking<00:05:49.150> zone<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.780> this<00:05:49.900> more<00:05:50.140> interesting

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
looking zone and this more interesting

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.380 
looking zone and this more interesting
zone<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.250> this<00:05:51.340> Morstan<00:05:51.760> this<00:05:52.030> song<00:05:52.240> that

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
zone and this Morstan this song that

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.540 
zone and this Morstan this song that
really<00:05:52.510> feels<00:05:52.840> alive<00:05:53.650> and<00:05:54.040> makes<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.370> world

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
really feels alive and makes the world

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.400 
really feels alive and makes the world
feel<00:05:54.910> like<00:05:55.090> it's<00:05:55.270> living<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.780> breathing<00:05:55.960> and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
feel like it's living and breathing and

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.430 
feel like it's living and breathing and
just<00:05:56.890> much<00:05:57.160> more<00:05:57.370> inhabitable<00:05:57.810> than<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:59.140> felt

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
just much more inhabitable than it felt

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.640 
just much more inhabitable than it felt
prior<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.370> this<00:06:00.580> point<00:06:00.910> so<00:06:01.180> I<00:06:01.540> just<00:06:02.260> wanted<00:06:02.530> to

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
prior to this point so I just wanted to

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.780 
prior to this point so I just wanted to
throw<00:06:02.770> that<00:06:02.860> out<00:06:02.980> there<00:06:03.220> I<00:06:03.280> wanted<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.640> give

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
throw that out there I wanted to give

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.850 
throw that out there I wanted to give
you<00:06:03.910> guys<00:06:03.940> some<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.840> my<00:06:04.960> thoughts<00:06:05.260> on<00:06:05.590> how<00:06:05.800> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
you guys some of my thoughts on how the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.370 
you guys some of my thoughts on how the
game<00:06:06.250> is<00:06:06.490> structured<00:06:07.060> at<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.450> moment<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:07.990> how

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
game is structured at the moment and how

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.900 
game is structured at the moment and how
I<00:06:08.410> think<00:06:08.770> they<00:06:08.860> can<00:06:09.040> improve<00:06:09.190> it<00:06:09.550> and<00:06:09.670> again

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
I think they can improve it and again

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.360 
I think they can improve it and again
like<00:06:10.060> I<00:06:10.240> said<00:06:10.270> either<00:06:10.780> toss<00:06:11.440> lamber<00:06:11.980> forced

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
like I said either toss lamber forced

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.640 
like I said either toss lamber forced
within<00:06:12.790> the<00:06:12.940> first<00:06:13.210> two<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.600> three<00:06:13.840> hours<00:06:13.870> so

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
within the first two to three hours so

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.110 
within the first two to three hours so
that<00:06:14.680> people<00:06:15.070> can<00:06:15.250> see<00:06:15.520> that<00:06:15.730> this<00:06:15.850> game

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
that people can see that this game

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.540 
that people can see that this game
actually<00:06:16.330> does<00:06:17.020> have<00:06:17.290> some<00:06:17.500> substance<00:06:17.890> to<00:06:18.280> its

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
actually does have some substance to its

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.730 
actually does have some substance to its
zones<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.300> it's<00:06:19.780> not<00:06:19.960> just<00:06:20.200> this<00:06:20.350> tiny

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
zones and it's not just this tiny

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.710 
zones and it's not just this tiny
corridor<00:06:21.400> that<00:06:21.610> you<00:06:21.730> go<00:06:21.880> from<00:06:22.090> point<00:06:22.270> A<00:06:22.480> to<00:06:22.510> B

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
corridor that you go from point A to B

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.590 
corridor that you go from point A to B
and<00:06:23.110> then<00:06:23.560> hit<00:06:23.770> repeat<00:06:24.220> it<00:06:24.520> they<00:06:24.970> actually

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
and then hit repeat it they actually

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.900 
and then hit repeat it they actually
have<00:06:25.750> some<00:06:25.930> interesting-looking<00:06:26.410> areas<00:06:27.220> then

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
have some interesting-looking areas then

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.910 
have some interesting-looking areas then
I<00:06:28.270> think<00:06:29.020> you're<00:06:29.140> going<00:06:29.230> to<00:06:29.290> have<00:06:29.650> a<00:06:29.680> lot<00:06:29.860> more

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
I think you're going to have a lot more

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.590 
I think you're going to have a lot more
people<00:06:30.370> that<00:06:30.520> might<00:06:30.670> stick<00:06:30.940> around<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.480> give

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
people that might stick around to give

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.870 
people that might stick around to give
