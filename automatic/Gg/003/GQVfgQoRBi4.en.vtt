part this is all pretty crude and simple
hey<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.250> works<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.850> puss<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.420> here<00:03:00.660> what

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
hey it works you puss out of here what

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.610 
hey it works you puss out of here what
I've<00:03:01.780> got<00:03:01.989> here<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.350> just<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:04.239> just<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.720> DC

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
I've got here is just a is just a DC

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.080 
I've got here is just a is just a DC
motor<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:06.160> i<00:03:06.190> got<00:03:06.430> from<00:03:06.700> radio<00:03:07.120> shack<00:03:07.180> and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
motor that i got from radio shack and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.670 
motor that i got from radio shack and
had<00:03:10.090> some<00:03:10.360> little<00:03:10.630> leads<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.260> up<00:03:11.380> or<00:03:11.590> i

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
had some little leads on it up or i

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.370 
had some little leads on it up or i
soldered<00:03:12.130> some<00:03:12.370> 9-volt<00:03:13.360> battery<00:03:13.750> leads<00:03:13.959> on<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
soldered some 9-volt battery leads on it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.090 
soldered some 9-volt battery leads on it
and<00:03:14.590> i<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.720> i<00:03:16.780> basically<00:03:17.019> just<00:03:17.380> rigged<00:03:17.829> up<00:03:17.980> a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
and i and i basically just rigged up a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.250 
and i and i basically just rigged up a
little<00:03:18.340> mount<00:03:18.579> out<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.940> little<00:03:19.180> pieces<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.840> can

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
little mount out of little pieces of can

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.910 
little mount out of little pieces of can
metal<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:21.459> hold<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.970> fan<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.570> then<00:03:23.530> i<00:03:23.680> made

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
metal to hold the fan and then i made

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.970 
metal to hold the fan and then i made
this<00:03:24.100> round<00:03:24.459> part<00:03:24.870> basically<00:03:25.870> goes<00:03:26.440> into<00:03:26.829> that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
this round part basically goes into that

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.900 
this round part basically goes into that
hole<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:29.160> that's<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.519> that's<00:03:30.640> all

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
hole and so that's really that's all

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.509 
hole and so that's really that's all
there<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.480> it's<00:03:31.720> pretty<00:03:31.930> simple<00:03:32.519> but

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
there is to it it's pretty simple but

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.400 
there is to it it's pretty simple but
let<00:03:33.760> me<00:03:35.310> show<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.459> how<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.989> give<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.320> an

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
let me show you how just give you an

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.340 
let me show you how just give you an
idea<00:03:38.500> how<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.070> works<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:41.320> one<00:03:41.650> actually

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
idea how it works this this one actually

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.870 
idea how it works this this one actually
puts<00:03:44.350> out<00:03:44.560> way<00:03:44.829> too<00:03:44.859> much<00:03:45.370> air<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:48.609> i<00:03:48.640> actually

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
puts out way too much air so i actually

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.400 
puts out way too much air so i actually
wound<00:03:49.329> up<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.840> make<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.410> mason<00:03:50.859> version

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
wound up and make a mason version

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.620 
wound up and make a mason version
this<00:03:51.740> where<00:03:52.550> i<00:03:52.580> put<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.880> variable<00:03:53.480> resistor

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
this where i put a variable resistor

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.870 
this where i put a variable resistor
kind<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.440> like<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> speaker<00:03:55.070> volume<00:03:55.250> control

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
kind of like a speaker volume control

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.930 
kind of like a speaker volume control
and<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:57.080> i<00:03:57.320> could<00:03:57.620> slow<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.040> down<00:03:58.220> or<00:03:58.460> speed

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
and that i could slow it down or speed

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.240 
and that i could slow it down or speed
it<00:03:59.060> up<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.080> when<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.290> thing's<00:04:00.590> going<00:04:00.980> full

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
it up so when this thing's going full

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.600 
it up so when this thing's going full
bore<00:04:01.810> I'll<00:04:02.810> tell<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.170> what<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.980> could<00:04:04.160> heat

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
bore I'll tell you what you could heat

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.300 
bore I'll tell you what you could heat
treat<00:04:04.910> metal<00:04:05.270> in<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.710> we<00:04:06.710> get<00:04:06.830> this<00:04:07.010> rag

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
treat metal in it we get this rag

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:17.830 
treat metal in it we get this rag
started<00:04:07.880> here<00:04:14.830> I'll<00:04:15.830> just<00:04:16.040> show<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:17.690> just

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
started here I'll just show you you just

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.720 
started here I'll just show you you just
you<00:04:18.200> stick<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.650> down<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.130> up<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.959> there

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
you stick that down and up can there

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.310 
you stick that down and up can there
when<00:04:22.730> I<00:04:22.850> turn<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.300> air<00:04:23.570> here<00:04:23.930> now<00:04:24.170> it's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
when I turn on the air here now it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.940 
when I turn on the air here now it's
going<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.560> get<00:04:24.650> noisy<00:04:25.010> able<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.490> hear<00:04:25.640> me<00:04:25.790> but

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
going to get noisy able to hear me but

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:42.490 
going to get noisy able to hear me but
this<00:04:27.950> thing<00:04:38.080> that's<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.440> old<00:04:40.450> twig<00:04:41.450> stove<00:04:41.810> and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
this thing that's the old twig stove and

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.970 
this thing that's the old twig stove and
i'm<00:04:43.430> going<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.670> show<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:45.260> do<00:04:45.440> i'm<00:04:45.590> going

i'm going to show you and do i'm going

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.020 
i'm going to show you and do i'm going
to<00:04:46.040> make<00:04:46.220> i'm<00:04:46.640> working<00:04:46.880> on<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.480> uses<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:49.030> uses

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
to make i'm working on that uses a uses

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.990 
to make i'm working on that uses a uses
a<00:04:50.150> pancake<00:04:50.750> fan<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:52.310> that's<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:52.670> going<00:04:52.880> to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
a pancake fan and that's just going to

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.780 
a pancake fan and that's just going to
go<00:04:53.150> right<00:04:53.180> here<00:04:53.980> that<00:04:54.980> will<00:04:55.190> mount<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.460> their

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
go right here that will mount to their

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.870 
go right here that will mount to their
this<00:04:56.120> thing<00:04:56.360> will<00:04:56.510> be<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.660> lot<00:04:57.050> quieter<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.880> the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
this thing will be a lot quieter and the

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.560 
this thing will be a lot quieter and the
air<00:04:59.060> volume<00:04:59.510> will<00:04:59.660> be<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.810> lot<00:05:00.050> less<00:05:00.320> i<00:05:00.650> think

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
air volume will be a lot less i think

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.110 
air volume will be a lot less i think
overall<00:05:02.570> it'll<00:05:03.050> probably<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:04.340> may<00:05:04.610> be<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:04.850> lot

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
overall it'll probably this may be a lot

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.570 
overall it'll probably this may be a lot
better<00:05:05.630> deal<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.770> want<00:05:06.980> to<00:05:07.100> show<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:07.310> this

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
better deal just want to show you this

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.070 
better deal just want to show you this
old<00:05:07.880> one<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.240> i<00:05:08.270> had<00:05:08.540> in<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:09.070> video
