00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 and I like youtube as it is despres 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 quite pretty well and on the day of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.240
 today I bring you a tutorial in this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.309
 occasion is an answer to my previous 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.219
 video of how to solve the problem of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 there is little storage space in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 our android devices a lot of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 you are telling me not to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.520
 the technique that I teach them works and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.350
 all right 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.890
 in this new video I'm going to show you 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.270
 another technique is working 100% what 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.490
 what we are going to do is download this 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.530
 application is called clean master is 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.750
 free on the place thor and well that is what 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.030
 what are we going to do, let's clean the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.040
 ram memory and the cache of our 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.320
 device to make it a bit more 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 fluid and solution to this problem ok 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 well then we are going to go here to the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.980
 option that says tasks 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.660
 I'm going to start scanning all the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 applications that we have open 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.960
 we give you here in clean 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.899
 in the situation button that is here 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.579
 it's already clean we go out with the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.940
 little arrow that we find here in the part 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.940
 higher 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.170
 we 're also going to go to history 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.119
 similarly begins to load 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.360
 everything that we have open in our 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.360
 device 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.550
 we wait a little while and in the same way 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.550
 we give in cleaning we give ok 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.830
 and we go here to residual files 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 here we give in ok and we give you clean 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.250
 we give him ok 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.250
 and then I'm going to start cleaning 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.190
 here we can select the files 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.750
 that we want to clean but 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.050
 with what I have told you is more than 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.240
 enough you will be able to use 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.710
 your device without any problem and you 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.690
 will solve the error that remains 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.160
 little storage space of equal 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.950
 way they should do the step that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.540
 I showed in the other video and every time 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.649
 this appears to you because they are going to do this 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.660
 process and they will see what is going to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.220
 disappear the problem you already know that if 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.630
 they liked the online video comment 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.770
 subscribe to the button that is here 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.630
 down social networks is in the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.350
 description and see you in the next 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.350
