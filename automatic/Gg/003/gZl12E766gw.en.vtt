00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.029
 or what there is, I am good mendizÃ¡bal and after 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 a somewhat long streak without climbing classes 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.610
 I want to come back here a little to the load 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 today with a funky rhythm of two measures 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.329
 I'm going to play it at normal speed and then 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.969
 I will dedicate myself to slow down a bit and 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.969
 stop to see it a bit piece by piece 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.649
 we will go 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.810
 and 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.720
 ah 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 Y 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.590
 well let's go now to see the rhythm a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.590
 little piece by piece 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.810
 Y 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.110
 Y 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.110
 ah 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560
 Y 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.580
 i 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.580
 Y 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.090
 i 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.090
 Y 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.739
 ah 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.739
 i 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.640
 yes 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.640
 Y 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.909
 note as much of the grace a 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.010
 little of this rhythm is in that hands 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.010
 they start in the second semi-eighth 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.380
 the right hand starting the second 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.750
 sixteenths instead of that hand 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.280
 right start at the first is let's say 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.060
 that the right hand pattern tends to 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.010
 sound very against very syncopated and other 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.830
 factor that in my opinion also the 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.450
 musicality is that the beginnings of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.130
 both bars both the first and the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.130
 second they are the same 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.500
 yes 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.500
 Y 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.890
 and finally I would say that the fact 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.830
 of the end of the second measure in 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.890
 black and where to see the black the crash 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.110
 and the box also rounds off a bit the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.330
 final and leaves a pretty obvious ending 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.090
 that is musical and also easy to 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.230
 continue for the rest both public and 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.980
 band 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.750
 so I leave you with it and remember 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.500
 provided that what is repeated many 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.110
 times slowly and correctly is what 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.510
 it really looks good so nothing a 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.510
 greeting and see you soon chao
