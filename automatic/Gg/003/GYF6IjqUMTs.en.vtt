no<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.019> think<00:01:01.549> is<00:01:02.549> much<00:01:02.670> better<00:01:02.850> than<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
no I think is much better than the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.999 
no I think is much better than the
narrow<00:01:03.870> Grom<00:01:04.080> he<00:01:04.199> played<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> daily<00:01:04.649> leg<00:01:04.860> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because of the factors that we have in a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.899

focusing on so we mostly try to play
short<00:03:34.659> passes<00:03:34.959> because<00:03:35.379> carrying<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.129> ball

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:36.219 
short passes because carrying a ball

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.429 
short passes because carrying a ball
would<00:03:36.370> not<00:03:36.489> help<00:03:36.639> our<00:03:36.819> considering<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.569> it's

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
would not help our considering that it's

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.039 
would not help our considering that it's
grass<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.340> we<00:03:39.489> thought<00:03:39.609> over<00:03:39.790> ourselves<00:03:40.540> very

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
grass so we thought over ourselves very

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.110 
grass so we thought over ourselves very
easy<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.980> short<00:03:42.219> passes<00:03:42.549> would<00:03:42.639> be<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.909> best

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
easy so short passes would be the best

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.809 
easy so short passes would be the best
thing<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.359> do<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.349> score<00:03:45.040> score<00:03:45.609> balls
