00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.410

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.670
 afflicted and needy seek the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.430

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.590
 helpless in the heights I will open rivers and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.660
 fountains in the middle of the valleys open in 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.730
 the desert ponds of waters and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.910
 springs of water on dry land 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.550
 I will give acacia cedars in the desert 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.700
 myrtles and olive trees will put in the solitude 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.950
 cypresses pines and forests together to 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.290
 that they see and know and warn and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.840
 understand all that the hand of jehovah 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.070
 does this and that the saint of israel 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.860
 I think 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.209
 alleged by your cause says jehovÃ¡ 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.370
 of jacob bring you announce what you have 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.670
 the beginning and we will put our heart 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.740
 in it 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.709

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.640

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.040
 give us new information about what should be 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.860
 later so that we know that you 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.959
 you are gods or at least do good or bad 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.830
 so we have to count and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.320
 together we marvel 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.960

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.810

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.860
 mud and how the potter steps on clay 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.380
 who announced it from the beginning to 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.040
 that we know or of time back and we will say 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.710
 it is just true there is no one who announces if 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.350
 there is no one who teaches certainly there is no 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.180
 whoever hears your words, I am the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.790
