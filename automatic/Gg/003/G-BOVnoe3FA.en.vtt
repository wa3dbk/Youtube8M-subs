00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 and you want to put some centers of fear 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.559
 hello friends come to zone 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.330
 training and in this case we will see 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.060
 how to send us centers of fear in the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.430
 fifa world cup 2014 and this is not so 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.960
 simple and a time grabs the measurement 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.090
 this first thing we have to do is 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.650
 position our diagonal centering 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.390
 slightly diagonally is in the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 goal then we place our 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.230
 forward and that's where we direct the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.689
 stick we press the lb and with 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.910
 pressed we send the center calculating 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.430
 the real force a colleague the ball 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.860
 Christian ronaldo tops alone and in a 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.140
 great position and with advantage for him here 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.289
 we see another example like we position the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.670
 diagonally centered is super important 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.170
 we direct the stick to the front 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.180
 we keep our eleve pressed and 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.190
 we send our center calculating the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.809
 force this will give us just the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.600
 power that is needed to achieve 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.910
 some incredible goals really is a 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.530
 very good technique and which has given me 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.359
 Very good results 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.460
 and it's just a great option when 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.200
 we are alone and perfect our 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.869
 technique we can do this here 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.030
 I improvise totally went crazy you 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.369
 he sent an analytical center and or pf 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.229
 so what do we need to do 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.299
 centers of fear and good position 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.860
 diagonal centering this means that 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.570
 we have to place a comfortable position 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.479
 so he can send the ball well and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.130
 correctly arrives at the front 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.690
 know the position the auctioneer knows 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.430
 a function the auctioneer can direct 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.110
 our stick towards him and that the ball 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.060
 it reaches you in an incredible way and a 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.729
 very good position to be able to finish the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.649
 ball goal this creates greater danger 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.080
 our centers using this technique go 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.490
 to have a very good precision to the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.780
 time to send their centers therefore 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.390
 leaves on a very good occasion to score his 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 front and obviously as in all 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.380
 the good headers because you have to have 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.490
 good auctioneers is not the same as you 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.800
 auction ribery or clichy or lion that you 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.300
 finish then do not be a ronaldo Christian 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.220
 a player high level chili mobile that 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.050
 have more conditions for the auction and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.000
 a powerful jump and that can place 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.530
 well the ball put I do not like to do 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.780
 everything for tutorials I hope it was 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.069

 outside the area
