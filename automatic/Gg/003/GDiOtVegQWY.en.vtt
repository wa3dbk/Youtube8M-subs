00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello, I recently acquired a very 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.069
 useful accessories for your 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.189
 multicooker 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.130
 but very quickly realized that things though 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.650
 very comfortable good but they unfortunately 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.450
 scratching one bowl of the slow cooker nowhere 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.400
 it was written that we need some 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 gaskets that simply says lozhite 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.740
 the bowl and everything is wonderful ham 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 was made with ham 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 and there are such solid 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.320
 scratches mess what can be done like 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 secure the cup further the more 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 that i have a new ceramic cup 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 which has not yet enjoyed and not just 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.140
 I would not want to further aggravate 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.079
 bowl scratch Teflon is possible 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.660
 do as we know even special 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.879
 plastic spatulas can be here 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.649
 use silicone pads to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.809
 sorry nowhere they say nothing 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.579
 do not attach if i do 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.550
 take advantage of a double boiler as in some 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.969
 multicooker that also does not work 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 it is installed this way 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.080
 there is on it does not apply and rightly so 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.299
 because she is such a model it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.689
 to be above the steam so what 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.140
 output 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.290
 I come up to help me coming here 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.350
 such a silicone mat 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.240
 designed for rolling dough 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 there are circles already drawn there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.070
 convenient for my goals in general i am from it 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.710
 I will cut a silicone circle for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 multicookers and spread it in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.250
 further preparations on one these 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.829
 cooking where I will install 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.229
 some kind of solid objects out like 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.549
 repaired or yogurt jars here 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.399
 There is an indication of the temperature at 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.369
 which can this silicone mat 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.820
 use from plus 260 degrees to 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.860
 minus 60 degrees centigrade ie me 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.799
 this is very suitable maximum 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 cooking temperature in a slow cooker 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.600
 160 degrees and bitter maintains 260 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.119
 a nice rug by the way is inexpensive 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.860
 as far as I remember, I bought it fixed 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.229
 Price and so not at all sorry 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.000
 I spread the bowl on the mat and look what 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.250
 diameter suits me 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.690
 this one doesnâ€™t fit for it and 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.660
 I will cut all the same bowl multicookers 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.080
 it is much more expensive that the mat is not necessary 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.960
 to regret 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 he will serve better and so 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.140
 Here is such a circle 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.720
 and now it will protect 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.580
 the bottom of the multicooker bowl from scratches and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.220
 damage that may leave 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.100
 useful accessories like ham 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.860
 and let's say yogurt jars can 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.290
 be something else if you know some 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.970
