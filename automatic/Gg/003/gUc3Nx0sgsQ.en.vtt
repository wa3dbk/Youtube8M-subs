00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
along dry fly fishing is probably the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.509 
along dry fly fishing is probably the
first<00:00:25.019> thing<00:00:25.230> anybody<00:00:25.859> thinks<00:00:26.160> about<00:00:26.220> when

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
first thing anybody thinks about when

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.310 
first thing anybody thinks about when
they<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.640> about<00:00:26.820> fly-fishing<00:00:27.320> everybody

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
they think about fly-fishing everybody

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
they think about fly-fishing everybody
wants<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> start<00:00:28.980> fly-fishing<00:00:29.429> imagines

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
wants to start fly-fishing imagines

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
wants to start fly-fishing imagines
catching<00:00:30.539> their<00:00:30.660> first<00:00:30.869> fish<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> dry<00:00:31.529> fly

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
catching their first fish on a dry fly

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
catching their first fish on a dry fly
sitting<00:00:32.160> nice<00:00:32.340> probably<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> surface<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
sitting nice probably on the surface and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
sitting nice probably on the surface and
seeing<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> tick<00:00:34.910> that's<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.120> all

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
seeing the tick that's what it's all

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
seeing the tick that's what it's all
about<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.840> that's<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> epitome<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
about I think that's the epitome of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.479 
about I think that's the epitome of
fly-fishing<00:00:38.570> now<00:00:39.829> when<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> comes<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.250> setting

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
fly-fishing now when it comes to setting

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.340 
fly-fishing now when it comes to setting
up<00:00:41.730> we've<00:00:42.090> we've<00:00:42.570> obviously<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> consider

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
up we've we've obviously got to consider

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.310 
up we've we've obviously got to consider
the<00:00:43.680> leader<00:00:44.129> size<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.300> nylon<00:00:45.719> size<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the leader size the nylon size that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
the leader size the nylon size that
we're<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> tie<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> fly<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.700> we

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we're going to tie the fly on to and we

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
we're going to tie the fly on to and we
choose<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.140> appropriate<00:00:49.379> diameter<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
choose an appropriate diameter so that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.689 
choose an appropriate diameter so that
the<00:00:50.850> fly<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> sit<00:00:51.899> too<00:00:52.170> rigid

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
the fly is not going to sit too rigid

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.340 
the fly is not going to sit too rigid
but<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> some<00:00:55.199> kind

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
but so that it's going to have some kind

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.910 
but so that it's going to have some kind
of<00:00:55.469> movement<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> water<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.730> hopefully

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
of movement on the water and hopefully

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.349 
of movement on the water and hopefully
we<00:00:58.920> pick<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> size<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> fish<00:00:59.910> aren't

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
we pick a size that the fish aren't

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.260 
we pick a size that the fish aren't
going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> notice<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.940> hopefully<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> line

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
going to notice and hopefully that line

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.520 
going to notice and hopefully that line
is<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.960> something<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
is going to be just something on the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
is going to be just something on the
surface<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.760> treat<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.450> very

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
surface and we will treat that it's very

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.160 
surface and we will treat that it's very
fine

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
fine

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.630 
fine
we<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.560> treat<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> sinks

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
we will treat that so that it sinks

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
we will treat that so that it sinks
below<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> surface<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> same<00:01:10.290> time

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
below the surface and at the same time

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
below the surface and at the same time
we'll<00:01:10.799> treat<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> dry<00:01:11.280> fly<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.790> sits<00:01:12.030> on

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
we'll treat the dry fly so it sits on

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.070 
we'll treat the dry fly so it sits on
the<00:01:12.420> surface<00:01:13.040> no<00:01:14.040> dry<00:01:15.000> flies<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.869> are

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the surface no dry flies there are

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.570 
the surface no dry flies there are
everybody's<00:01:16.740> dry<00:01:16.920> fly<00:01:17.130> blocks<00:01:17.369> looks

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
everybody's dry fly blocks looks

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.980 
everybody's dry fly blocks looks
different<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.090> here's<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.810> some

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
different but here's what here are some

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
different but here's what here are some
of<00:01:19.080> mine<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> us<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.700> water<00:01:20.909> dry

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
of mine this is some of us go water dry

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.140 
of mine this is some of us go water dry
flies<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> few<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> us<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:26.549> amongst<00:01:26.880> all

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
flies and a few of us and in amongst all

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.469 
flies and a few of us and in amongst all
those<00:01:27.330> we've<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:28.790> various<00:01:29.790> sizes<00:01:30.240> various

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
those we've got various sizes various

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
those we've got various sizes various
shapes<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.560> basically<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.159> we're<00:01:32.280> trying

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
shapes but basically what we're trying

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
shapes but basically what we're trying
to<00:01:32.670> cover<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> midges<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> up

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
to cover are all the midges all the up

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.910 
to cover are all the midges all the up
wings<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> sedges<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.740> those

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
wings and all the sedges and all those

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.819 
wings and all the sedges and all those
flies<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:39.290> takes<00:01:40.290> care<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> most

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
flies there takes care of most

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.359 
flies there takes care of most
situations<00:01:41.070> these<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> small<00:01:42.150> flies

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
situations these are the small flies

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.800 
situations these are the small flies
also<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.549> require<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.360> fine<00:01:45.570> leader

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
also these require a very fine leader

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.289 
also these require a very fine leader

now I'll tie a dry fly on and we'll see

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
now I'll tie a dry fly on and we'll see
see<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.000> pick<00:01:57.179> up<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> fish<00:01:57.509> too<00:01:57.630> dear

fingertip and once the fingers are wet
and<00:04:18.510> it's<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.959> brush<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.440> dressing<00:04:19.799> we

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
and it's just brush the dressing we

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.070 
and it's just brush the dressing we
don't<00:04:20.760> want<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.030> ever<00:04:21.209> make<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.510> dressing

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
don't want to ever make that dressing

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.830 
don't want to ever make that dressing
look<00:04:22.320> wet<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:23.160> just<00:04:23.190> needs<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.700> be<00:04:23.790> brush<00:04:24.060> with

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840

float then we you only put apply the

we<00:04:50.970> leave<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> rest<00:04:51.390> so<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.900> sinks<00:04:52.169> there<00:04:52.860> you

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
we leave the rest so it sinks there you

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.370 
we leave the rest so it sinks there you
go<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.430> still<00:04:53.730> looks<00:04:53.940> nice<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:55.020> drowned

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
go it still looks nice it's not drowned

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:06.460 
go it still looks nice it's not drowned
and<00:04:56.010> that's<00:04:56.310> going<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.520> float

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.680 

so<00:05:07.470> just<00:05:07.680> like<00:05:07.830> every<00:05:07.949> other<00:05:08.389> approach<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.600> the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
so just like every other approach to the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420 
so just like every other approach to the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
water and fly fishing we're always going

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.159 
water and fly fishing we're always going
to<00:05:11.490> have<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.940> look<00:05:12.120> at<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.360> edges<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.900> see<00:05:13.050> if<00:05:13.110> we

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
to have a look at the edges to see if we

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.129 
to have a look at the edges to see if we
can<00:05:13.320> see<00:05:13.440> any<00:05:13.560> fish<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.479> two<00:05:15.479> advantages<00:05:15.960> to

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
can see any fish and two advantages to

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.450 
can see any fish and two advantages to
my<00:05:16.669> glasses<00:05:17.669> obviously<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.720> safety<00:05:18.930> but<00:05:19.919> with

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
my glasses obviously the safety but with

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.340 
my glasses obviously the safety but with
the<00:05:20.550> polarizing<00:05:21.090> lens<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.870> helps<00:05:22.199> miss

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
the polarizing lens that helps miss

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.290 
the polarizing lens that helps miss
block<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.800> hopefully<00:05:23.340> hopefully<00:05:23.789> will<00:05:24.120> pick

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
block and hopefully hopefully will pick

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:34.340 
block and hopefully hopefully will pick
something<00:05:24.630> up

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.370 

I<00:05:34.640> went<00:05:35.640> fishing<00:05:35.910> dry<00:05:36.120> fly<00:05:36.390> there's<00:05:37.050> many

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
I went fishing dry fly there's many

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.200 
I went fishing dry fly there's many
things<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.800> think<00:05:37.950> about<00:05:38.220> but<00:05:38.460> but<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.090> this

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
things to think about but but in this

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.760 
things to think about but but in this
situation<00:05:39.450> we're<00:05:39.810> on<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:39.990> still<00:05:40.290> water<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:40.680> I'm

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
situation we're on a still water so I'm

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.710 
situation we're on a still water so I'm
not<00:05:40.860> expecting<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.400> that<00:05:42.060> flight<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.510> move

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
not expecting that that flight to move

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.470 
not expecting that that flight to move
really<00:05:43.290> fast<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:44.130> occasionally<00:05:44.610> I<00:05:44.880> Mir<00:05:45.270> well

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
really fast but occasionally I Mir well

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.710 
really fast but occasionally I Mir well
just<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.530> pop<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.860> just<00:05:47.180> just<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.300> cause<00:05:48.480> some

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
just just pop it just just to cause some

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.420 
just just pop it just just to cause some
disturbance<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.410> hopefully<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> fish<00:05:49.980> season

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
disturbance and hopefully a fish season

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.310 
disturbance and hopefully a fish season
and<00:05:50.970> when<00:05:51.090> they<00:05:51.210> see<00:05:51.390> it<00:05:51.510> it<00:05:51.750> looks<00:05:51.780> like<00:05:52.050> it's

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
and when they see it it looks like it's

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.600 
and when they see it it looks like it's
an<00:05:52.410> insect<00:05:52.740> trying<00:05:52.890> to<00:05:53.010> break<00:05:53.280> through<00:05:53.490> the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
an insect trying to break through the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.670 
an insect trying to break through the
surface<00:05:53.880> film<00:05:54.210> once<00:05:54.870> an<00:05:55.020> insect<00:05:55.320> bricks<00:05:55.560> to

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
surface film once an insect bricks to

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.440 
surface film once an insect bricks to
the<00:05:55.710> surface<00:05:56.070> film<00:05:56.280> then<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:56.820> can<00:05:56.940> hatch<00:05:57.120> in<00:05:57.330> if

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
the surface film then it can hatch in if

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.960 
the surface film then it can hatch in if
it<00:05:57.630> can<00:05:57.750> fly<00:05:57.990> off<00:05:58.140> in<00:05:58.290> a<00:05:58.350> subtle<00:05:58.650> form<00:05:58.940> so<00:05:59.940> a

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
it can fly off in a subtle form so a

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.820 
it can fly off in a subtle form so a
little<00:06:00.210> pop<00:06:00.390> occasionally<00:06:00.930> can<00:06:01.440> just<00:06:01.650> get

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
little pop occasionally can just get

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.530 
little pop occasionally can just get
their<00:06:01.950> attention

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.330 

now<00:06:06.540> hopefully<00:06:06.960> we'll<00:06:07.080> get<00:06:07.200> a<00:06:07.260> tick<00:06:07.530> but<00:06:07.830> but

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
now hopefully we'll get a tick but but

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.770 
now hopefully we'll get a tick but but
the<00:06:08.430> things<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.730> think<00:06:08.940> about<00:06:08.970> when<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.570> fish

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
the things to think about when a fish

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.470 
the things to think about when a fish
does<00:06:10.020> take<00:06:10.290> and<00:06:10.470> dry<00:06:10.590> fly<00:06:10.800> fishing<00:06:10.830> on<00:06:11.280> a<00:06:12.120> river

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
does take and dry fly fishing on a river

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.870 
does take and dry fly fishing on a river
on<00:06:12.780> a<00:06:12.840> very<00:06:13.080> fast<00:06:13.290> flowing<00:06:13.650> river<00:06:13.920> fish<00:06:14.760> are

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
on a very fast flowing river fish are

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.280 
on a very fast flowing river fish are
going<00:06:15.000> to<00:06:15.060> grab<00:06:15.270> at<00:06:15.390> that<00:06:15.540> fly<00:06:15.750> very<00:06:15.810> quickly

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
going to grab at that fly very quickly

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.840 
going to grab at that fly very quickly
and<00:06:16.530> when<00:06:16.740> they<00:06:16.860> grab<00:06:17.070> at<00:06:17.190> that<00:06:17.310> fly<00:06:17.490> quickly

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
and when they grab at that fly quickly

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.370 
and when they grab at that fly quickly
we've<00:06:17.970> got<00:06:18.180> to<00:06:18.270> be<00:06:18.330> fast<00:06:18.510> our<00:06:18.780> reactions<00:06:19.230> with

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
we've got to be fast our reactions with

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.350 
we've got to be fast our reactions with
the<00:06:19.500> rod<00:06:19.650> have<00:06:19.980> to<00:06:20.070> be<00:06:20.160> very<00:06:20.400> quick<00:06:20.610> to<00:06:21.060> set<00:06:21.270> the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
the rod have to be very quick to set the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.030 
the rod have to be very quick to set the
hook<00:06:21.480> otherwise<00:06:22.260> they<00:06:22.440> split<00:06:22.620> that<00:06:22.770> fly<00:06:23.010> out

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
hook otherwise they split that fly out

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.460 
hook otherwise they split that fly out
in<00:06:23.280> an<00:06:23.400> instant<00:06:23.550> on<00:06:24.360> a<00:06:24.690> still<00:06:25.020> water<00:06:25.050> however

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
in an instant on a still water however

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.010 
in an instant on a still water however
that<00:06:26.460> can<00:06:26.760> happen<00:06:27.030> but<00:06:27.330> more<00:06:27.600> often<00:06:27.840> than<00:06:27.990> not

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
that can happen but more often than not

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.230 
that can happen but more often than not
what<00:06:28.350> we<00:06:28.440> get<00:06:28.620> is<00:06:28.740> a<00:06:28.770> sort<00:06:29.460> of<00:06:29.550> head<00:06:30.000> and<00:06:30.030> tail

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
what we get is a sort of head and tail

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.810 
what we get is a sort of head and tail
rise<00:06:30.750> where<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.110> fish<00:06:31.290> roll<00:06:31.650> on<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.010> fly<00:06:32.250> and

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
rise where the fish roll on the fly and

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.910 
rise where the fish roll on the fly and
we<00:06:33.000> can<00:06:33.150> actually<00:06:33.300> see<00:06:33.780> the<00:06:34.020> mouth<00:06:34.440> Ortman<00:06:34.800> at

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
we can actually see the mouth Ortman at

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.920 
we can actually see the mouth Ortman at
times<00:06:35.160> and<00:06:35.760> when<00:06:35.910> that<00:06:36.060> happens<00:06:36.390> if<00:06:36.510> we<00:06:36.630> snatch

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
times and when that happens if we snatch

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.720 
times and when that happens if we snatch
it<00:06:37.080> too<00:06:37.170> quickly<00:06:37.440> with<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.770> rod<00:06:37.950> then<00:06:38.430> we<00:06:38.520> pull

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
it too quickly with the rod then we pull

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.490 
it too quickly with the rod then we pull
the<00:06:38.820> fly<00:06:39.000> right<00:06:39.210> off<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.360> fish's<00:06:39.660> mouth<00:06:39.690> so

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
the fly right off the fish's mouth so

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500 
the fly right off the fish's mouth so
there's<00:06:40.710> an<00:06:40.830> old<00:06:40.920> thing<00:06:41.340> that<00:06:41.640> fishermen<00:06:42.270> use

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
there's an old thing that fishermen use

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.620 
there's an old thing that fishermen use

god save the queen' I prefer this one's
a<00:06:45.720> big<00:06:45.900> one<00:06:45.930> but<00:06:46.500> if<00:06:46.590> you<00:06:46.710> see<00:06:46.890> something<00:06:46.920> in

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
a big one but if you see something in

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.490 
a big one but if you see something in
your<00:06:47.550> mind<00:06:47.730> this<00:06:48.210> one's<00:06:48.450> a<00:06:48.540> big<00:06:48.720> one<00:06:48.750> then<00:06:49.200> set

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
your mind this one's a big one then set

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.340 
your mind this one's a big one then set
the<00:06:49.620> hook<00:06:49.740> then<00:06:50.400> hopefully<00:06:50.930> you<00:06:51.930> get<00:06:52.260> the

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
the hook then hopefully you get the

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.840 
the hook then hopefully you get the
timing<00:06:52.590> right<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:52.890> the<00:06:53.160> fish<00:06:53.340> I<00:06:53.460> don't<00:06:53.520> spot

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
timing right and the fish I don't spot

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.640 
timing right and the fish I don't spot
the<00:06:53.940> fly<00:06:54.120> out<00:06:54.240> where<00:06:54.720> you've<00:06:54.840> set<00:06:55.170> the<00:06:55.290> hook<00:06:55.380> as

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
the fly out where you've set the hook as

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.410 
the fly out where you've set the hook as
he's<00:06:56.100> turned<00:06:56.370> downwards<00:06:56.880> with<00:06:57.060> the<00:06:57.180> flight

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
he's turned downwards with the flight

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.470 
he's turned downwards with the flight
which<00:06:57.660> is<00:06:57.810> very<00:06:57.990> important
