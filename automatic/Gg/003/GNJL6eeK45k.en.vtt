feature so let's take a quick look it's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
feature so let's take a quick look it's
got<00:01:56.130> some<00:01:56.280> quick<00:01:56.549> specs<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.689> inside

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
got some quick specs here on the inside

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.910 
got some quick specs here on the inside
as<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> USB<00:02:00.180> output<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.140> 5<00:02:01.560> volt

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
as you can see the USB output is 5 volt

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
as you can see the USB output is 5 volt
2<00:02:02.219> amps<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.540> gonna<00:02:03.689> charge<00:02:03.990> rather

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
2 amps so it is gonna charge rather

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.240 
2 amps so it is gonna charge rather
quickly<00:02:04.700> tablets<00:02:05.700> phones<00:02:06.590> GPS<00:02:07.590> devices<00:02:07.950> if

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
quickly tablets phones GPS devices if

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
quickly tablets phones GPS devices if
you're<00:02:08.369> out<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.819> know<00:02:08.970> camping<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:10.259> hiking

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you're out you know camping or hiking

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.500 
you're out you know camping or hiking
and<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> got<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> GPS<00:02:11.459> device<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> it's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and you got a GPS device with you it's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.830 
and you got a GPS device with you it's
going<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
going to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
going to
pretty<00:02:13.290> quick<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.690> maximum<00:02:16.470> current<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:17.400> 2.16

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
pretty quick the maximum current is 2.16

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.920 
pretty quick the maximum current is 2.16
and<00:02:18.660> 1.8<00:02:19.370> amps<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.060> again<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> 14<00:02:22.379> watt

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
and 1.8 amps and again this is a 14 watt

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.740 
and 1.8 amps and again this is a 14 watt
solar<00:02:24.930> panel<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:26.519> pretty<00:02:27.000> powerful<00:02:27.209> solar

really really cool so let's go ahead I'm
going<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.720> pause<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> video<00:02:37.080> we're<00:02:37.379> going<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
going to pause the video we're going to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
going to pause the video we're going to
take<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.830> outside<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.640> we're<00:02:38.910> going<00:02:39.030> to

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
take this outside and we're going to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.820 
take this outside and we're going to
demonstrate<00:02:39.209> how<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.530> charge

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
demonstrate how it's going to charge

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.910 
demonstrate how it's going to charge
just<00:02:41.640> take<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.819> quick<00:02:42.000> look<00:02:42.209> at<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.739> I'm<00:02:43.739> gonna

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
just take a quick look at it I'm gonna

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.289 
just take a quick look at it I'm gonna
actually<00:02:44.160> leave<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.670> out<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.030> let<00:02:45.209> it

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
actually leave this out and let it

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.880 
actually leave this out and let it
charge<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.079> we're<00:02:46.200> gonna<00:02:46.319> demonstrate

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
charge and then we're gonna demonstrate

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.860 
charge and then we're gonna demonstrate
charging<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.849> our<00:02:47.940> devices<00:02:48.209> with<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
charging one of our devices with it so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.839 
charging one of our devices with it so
I'll<00:02:49.079> pause<00:02:49.319> video<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.130> we'll<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:50.670> back

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
guys hey guys we've taken our solar

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.000 
guys hey guys we've taken our solar
charger<00:02:54.930> by<00:02:55.110> power<00:02:55.380> add<00:02:55.880> outside<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:58.010> one

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
charger by power add outside and one

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.900 
charger by power add outside and one
thing<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.220> want<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> note<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:01.560> my<00:03:01.910> Nexus

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
thing I want to note is I have my Nexus

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.610 
thing I want to note is I have my Nexus
5<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.920> pretty<00:03:05.310> charged<00:03:05.790> up<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.620> if

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
5 here and it's pretty charged up but if

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.650 
5 here and it's pretty charged up but if
I<00:03:07.920> was<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.340> take<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.090> plug<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.569> in

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
I was to take this and just plug it in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.180 
I was to take this and just plug it in
indoors

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
indoors

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.330 
indoors
this<00:03:11.670> isn't<00:03:11.910> gonna<00:03:12.060> charge<00:03:12.329> this<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.900> strictly

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
this isn't gonna charge this is strictly

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.030 
this isn't gonna charge this is strictly
by<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.400> Sun<00:03:15.000> directly<00:03:15.810> from<00:03:16.500> these<00:03:16.769> solar

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
by the Sun directly from these solar

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.670 
by the Sun directly from these solar
panels<00:03:17.269> it'll<00:03:18.269> charge<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:19.170> won't<00:03:19.350> hold<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
panels it'll charge it won't hold the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.979 
panels it'll charge it won't hold the
charge<00:03:19.859> so<00:03:20.280> if<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.430> take<00:03:20.579> this<00:03:20.730> inside<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.870> know

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
charge so if I take this inside you know

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.809 
charge so if I take this inside you know
it's<00:03:22.019> not<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.980> produce<00:03:23.130> anything<00:03:23.519> for

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
it's not going to produce anything for

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.670 
it's not going to produce anything for
me<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.209> strictly<00:03:24.389> taking<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.410> sun's

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
me this is strictly taking the sun's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.890 
me this is strictly taking the sun's
energy<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.400> solar<00:03:26.609> energy<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.180> putting<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
energy the solar energy and putting it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.890 
energy the solar energy and putting it
directly<00:03:28.049> into<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.090> power<00:03:30.090> hub<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.690> then

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
directly into the power hub and then

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.220 
directly into the power hub and then
directly<00:03:31.260> into<00:03:31.709> your<00:03:31.739> device<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.079> you've<00:03:34.079> got
