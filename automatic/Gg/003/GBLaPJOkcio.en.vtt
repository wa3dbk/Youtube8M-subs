00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.690
 It already goes like that in my fan of my tray here 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.910
 in the rag with the aluminum foil now 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.769
 I'm going to hydrate it a little with my liquid 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.769
 with my sugar syrup with water 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.700
 we add it for all the bread 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 we add our frosting and what 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 We spread in all the bread 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.260
 this child wrapped or roll is very rich 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.250
 I recommend you that there should be 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.250
 make 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.980
 it is very easy it seems that it is very 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.409
 complicated but really is not once 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.110
 follow the steps as it should be is 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.890
 very easy and very rich I recommend them 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 that they do 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.870
 we add our pineapple and our peach 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.510
 you can put the fruit of your 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.050
 preference or if you want they can put you 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.210
 natural fruit I'm putting this one 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.550
 in syrup but you will be put 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.470
 natural if you like 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.470
 likewise it tastes very rich 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.700
 and then nothing else would be left 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.250
 roll it up and put it in the refrigerator and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 wait here 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 I had a good time in the fridge yes yes 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.030
 prepare in the night then leave it all 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.030
 the night to better grip the taste 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.570
 so we finish 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.710
 Now what we are going to do is roll it up 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.070
 and today roll the first part 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.330
 if you can see already double the first part 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.330
 we are going to continue 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.720
 who are going to grab 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.720
 in his paper and he will turn his bread 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.500
 that's why we needed the rag 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.100
 it was damp so it does not stick 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100
 with the funk 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.480
 second round let's give a third 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.480
 repose 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.400
 can they put their sea 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.400
 quiet another 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.239
 we're going to leave it wrapped in the rag and 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.129
 we are going to press it very well with our 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.890
 aluminum foil to take it to 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.930
 refrigerator we take it to our 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.629
 refrigerator and we're going to leave it here 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.390
 they were very good time well then 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.540
 6 hours passed since I got the roll 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.359
 of peach with pineapple in the refrigerator 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.730
 that's how it was right now and nothing else 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.030
 I'm going to decorate and I show you how I 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030
 remains 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.260
 good I show you how was mine already 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.600
 I put the frosting over it was left 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.910
 perfectly but here I show you how 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.430
 I was left and nothing else I'm going to add a 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.790
 little chocolate on top and I would be 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.790
 ready 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.519
 well I share with you this is how it was 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.130
 I added some chocolate top 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.380
 I hope you try to do it is very 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.150
 very easy to get rich with very few 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.660
 ingredients 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.389
