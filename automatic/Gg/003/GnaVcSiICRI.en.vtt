00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.370
 everyone loves today there is a big one 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.320
 mccall from me and that really worked 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
 already over months 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 I accumulated at that time 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.350
 Eyeshadow bought because of my lipstick 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.609
 and there came a lot together now 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.140
 but it's really mine too 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.029
 favorite brand and I'm real 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
 convinced of the products only because of that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 I have indulged in that from time to time and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.689
 now enough has accumulated around you 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 to show the video and, above all, have 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.869
 I waited for the palette and me 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.040
 finally wanted to line up my eyeshadow 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.090
 then I can fill that, too 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
 show better 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.520
 i have the necker and douglas and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 shopped at breuninger and also at 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 mac store itself in frankfurt and also 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.399
 ordered online and always here 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.829
 and there a part 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.390
 and when I had put it down 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 I first thank this beautiful thank you 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.610
 card from mac I found 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.809
 really cute and a free mascara the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.789
 I have not tested yet 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.449
 I will do if I mean 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.320
 used up that 's the sum 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.979
 mascara and I will definitely be you 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 even then to say so 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.680
 what is going on all the time now 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.729
 have waited in this beautiful 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.270
 packet here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 that's the mac palette and there 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 I already have my eyeshadow 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.759
 which looks really nice and beautiful 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.640
 noble and I'll show you right away 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.299
 also close but just before yet 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.340
 I do not have any of these in parts 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.750
 bought because there would be only 15 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.329
 fit in the eyeshadow 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.520
 and here, that's just what fits 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.409
 are now 13 pieces and there are stops 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.390
 also two almost full rows 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.420
 Of course, it can still fill up now 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.329
 and the seller of the keeps better 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.149
 the owner schönefeld also very good 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.680
 because yes there are magnets thorn and 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.040
 nothing out for that and I have it on 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.049
 So do not worry about it 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.310
 It's better to just fit in more and to fit it 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.360
 can still be over the years 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 Gather that a little 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.570
 but now i have the colors i have 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.680
 absolutely wanted to have and am very 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.450
 satisfied with it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.899
 and yes we'll have a look 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.430
 closer to her you can see the palette 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.860
 again from the name that really looks 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.950
 very beautiful and noble I like 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.099
 also the magnetic lock very much and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.770
 yes here we come to closer again 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.360
 all colors 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.150
 So I hope everyone gets it again 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.110
 Together this is a great nylon 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.819
 Highlighters do naked lunch next to it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:33.480
 that went wrong 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.860
 then cranberry and antibes arrive 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:44.030
 super autumn ton I think this one's 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.590
 sable then comes the set and goodwin 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.440
 Match great for the lid fold around 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.790
 Blend twins and smart that is now 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.140
 my darkest toni in the palette and 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.090
 I still have to meet here and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.069
 as you can see, there is one more 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.700
 little space for more eyeshadows 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.000
 but I think they are enough now 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.840
 times and I hope you could the colors 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.310
 from perceived something better and yes 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.909
 maybe I wanted you too 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.840
 someday in a mac my 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.870
 palette video or so time to look but 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.140
 That's enough for now and that 's it 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.140
 then too 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.950
 so now you have looked closer and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.379
 I have not yet used except 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.360
 Today the first time I have nylon in 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.700
 eye angles used a very crass 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.830
 highlighter to make it landscapes 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.200
 movable lid and set-top in the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.360
 lid fold blinded and at first 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.799
 impression i find it very good but me 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.989
 can not say that much now 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.629
 At some point, maybe I still 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.010
 have a few more eyeshadows or you 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.720
 I am very interested in you then 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.519
 Let me tell you more when I have more 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.819
 maybe I'll do it 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.460
 a palette video or something in the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.090
 direction also with switches and such 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.370
 and yes the wii fans so that's yes 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.470
 these packages in here without the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.810
 Packaging which is only available online or 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.790
 at the mac store itself as douglas 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.480
 and friends have it so on 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.190
 Unfortunately not 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.170
 and they come here in this 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.120
 packaging but I have already all 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.490
 sorted it was the first time made 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.490
 old valletta had 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.960
 and yes then it goes on with the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.380
 lipsticks that are three pieces 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.660
 There were three new color chatter box 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.470
 is an amplified finish is a very 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.750
 bright pink he does for the summer me 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.450
 Wheelchair users simply have one 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.000
 very opaque pink but not so 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.490
 was like pink dolls but already so 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.460
 a bit more subtle, I would say 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.030
 amplified means yes that he holds well 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.240
 gets long as very opaque and creamy 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.690
 does not dry out and glitter 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.460
 shimmer or something 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:08.060
 then i have the color blue is a 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.280
 vice finish is such a nice one 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.970
 year old son Schöneberger would flirt 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.560
 I say 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.330
 and yes, vice is just very 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.850
 correctness does not donate very much 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.920
 not very durable but already 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.580
 okay and for that the lips seem nice 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.400
 through a beautiful shining this and glass 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.990
 and I like it very much 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.720
 a lot worn in the fall i have him 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.940
 also bought at the end of the summer and 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.960
 Finally, it is also my newest 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.060
 color the color of the lawyer 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.210
 Dark red tone is a war seemed 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.920
 I also like the finish today 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.170
 I really do not know yet 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.420
 whether the long stops because cream seemed 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.310
 actually not so much so far 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.970
 he counts quite well, I am 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.490
 curious; excited 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.370
 and yes it is such a nice darker 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.710
 roto very creamy but still very much 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.740
 covering and yes I think very nice 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.470
 take a look 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.690
 who holds so and finally I have me 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.810
 two more islands bought that are the 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.710
 both here once the mac 109th 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.610
 this is such an account brush 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.389
 or you can also for glass 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.650
 use it is now with me very 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.300
 but someday it will become like this 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.880
 little curse looks back in business 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.319
 also more frequent but that was now 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.389
 still on the packaging in it 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.000
 I used it for the first time today 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.160
 for meat and for contour can be 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.530
 I like it very much 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.819
 However, from blinding I came with it 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.229
 not so right now 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.840
 I have to again look but 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:43.060
 easy and precise to apply first 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.479
 I think they are great too, from the size 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.810
 It's a good way to work and do that 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.449
 notorious mac 217 who had to 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.250
 of course with and for my god I am 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.280
 really excited about it, I have her 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.020
 functional looks quite similar though 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.389
 somehow it's easy again 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.740
 More precisely you can see he is here now 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.650
 actually dirty he is white 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.300
 but I also have it in today 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.020
 the eyeliner is a bit blinded and 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.330
 I think it's super awesome and yes 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.240
 it's just totally easy with that 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.930
 blinded super good arrives precisely in 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.630
 The eyelid folds because it is so flat 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.099
 is bound and yes I find him 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.690
 really good now at first 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.370
 impression so much I can still 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.330
 Not to say I am so far 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.400
 once enough 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.169
 I have everything so beautifully kept and 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.259
 I wait until I can turn the video 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.389
 and now I will make everything beautiful here 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.520
 use 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.639
 and yes it was already with the 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.039
 video and I would be interested in what 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:47.050
 you think of mac you like the brand 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.300
 or do you find that too expensive and he 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.270
 Write me your opinion there would be 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.830
 I am very happy and that's where I fell 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.150
 also necessarily on instagram because I want 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.240
 I am always very happy frosty 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.330
 again a lot of pictures and that means 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.280
 camelia cosmetic is here too 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:06.960
 and yes that's it then enough advertising and 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.960
 everything to the next
