fear and today I'm going to be explained
the<00:00:04.259> difference<00:00:04.410> between<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.040> scan<00:00:05.370> bolt<00:00:05.640> and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
the difference between the scan bolt and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.849 
the difference between the scan bolt and
the<00:00:06.390> two<00:00:06.629> motion<00:00:06.990> sensors<00:00:07.290> for<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.500> Recon

3<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:11.070> I've<00:00:11.130> already<00:00:11.250> covered<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.610> video

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
3 now I've already covered a video

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490 
3 now I've already covered a video
talking<00:00:12.059> about<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> scan<00:00:12.690> bolt<00:00:12.900> exactly<00:00:13.380> how

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
talking about the scan bolt exactly how

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.900 
talking about the scan bolt exactly how
it<00:00:13.590> works<00:00:13.740> I'll<00:00:13.980> link<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> screen<00:00:14.700> or

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it works I'll link that on the screen or

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.099 
it works I'll link that on the screen or

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
today's video I'm going to be discussing

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
today's video I'm going to be discussing
the<00:00:19.109> differences<00:00:19.500> between<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.460> scan<00:00:20.760> bolt

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the differences between the scan bolt

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.580 
the differences between the scan bolt
and<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> two<00:00:21.359> motion<00:00:21.720> sensor<00:00:22.020> equipment<00:00:22.230> in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
and the two motion sensor equipment in

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.790 
and the two motion sensor equipment in
the<00:00:22.769> Recon<00:00:23.100> class<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> scan<00:00:25.199> bolt<00:00:25.439> differs

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the Recon class so the scan bolt differs

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
the Recon class so the scan bolt differs
very<00:00:26.400> much<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> two<00:00:27.480> pieces<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
very much so from the two pieces of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.480 
very much so from the two pieces of
equipment<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> Recon<00:00:28.800> class<00:00:29.039> used<00:00:29.310> for

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
equipment in the Recon class used for

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
equipment in the Recon class used for
motion<00:00:29.789> sensors<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> couple<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
motion sensors and there's a couple of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.020 
motion sensors and there's a couple of
reasons<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.769> actually<00:00:32.130> give<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.610> scandal

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
reasons that actually give the scandal

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.459 
reasons that actually give the scandal
the<00:00:33.149> advantage<00:00:33.510> over<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.960> several<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the advantage over them and several that

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.700 
the advantage over them and several that
actually<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.809> first<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> all<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.200> terms<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
actually do not first of all in terms of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
actually do not first of all in terms of
its<00:00:38.070> scanning<00:00:38.370> ability<00:00:38.879> thus<00:00:39.210> gain<00:00:39.480> bolt<00:00:39.660> fall

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
its scanning ability thus gain bolt fall

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
its scanning ability thus gain bolt fall
short<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.379> both<00:00:40.620> T<00:00:41.100> uggs<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> ma<00:00:41.850> vie<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
short of both T uggs and ma vie in the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
short of both T uggs and ma vie in the
sense<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> when<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> fire<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:44.129> bolt

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
sense of when you fire off your bolt

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
sense of when you fire off your bolt
whenever<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.969> shoot<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.140> hits<00:00:46.320> the

target sends off its kind of scanning

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.720 
target sends off its kind of scanning

going it's not a continuous can't like
both<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> uggs<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> ma<00:00:53.699> vie<00:00:53.969> once<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
both the uggs and the ma vie once you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
both the uggs and the ma vie once you
fire<00:00:55.020> off<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.350> shot<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.800> sends<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
fire off that shot it sends out that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.150 
fire off that shot it sends out that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
kind of radar pulse and signal scan one

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
kind of radar pulse and signal scan one
time<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> no<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
time and then it is no more you have to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
time and then it is no more you have to
fire<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.140> another<00:01:01.170> shot<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.890> order<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.309> use<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
fire off another shot in order to use it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.020 
fire off another shot in order to use it
again<00:01:03.170> also<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.530> range<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> scan<00:01:05.610> bolt<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
again also the range on the scan bolt is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
again also the range on the scan bolt is
very<00:01:06.450> small<00:01:06.900> compared<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.130> T

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
very small compared to that of the T

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.969 
very small compared to that of the T
uggs<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> ma<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.689> only<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:09.990> 10<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.680> 12

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
uggs and ma be it's only around 10 to 12

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
uggs and ma be it's only around 10 to 12
meters<00:01:11.189> when<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> fire<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.150> off<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> range

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
meters when you fire it off is the range

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
meters when you fire it off is the range
in<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.500> spot<00:01:13.830> enemies<00:01:14.220> versus<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
in which it will spot enemies versus the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.390 
in which it will spot enemies versus the
30<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> 35<00:01:15.659> meters<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.350> both<00:01:16.530> VT<00:01:17.040> uggs<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
30 to 35 meters for both VT uggs and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.679 
30 to 35 meters for both VT uggs and
maybe<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.420> might<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
maybe I think one of them might be a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.880 
maybe I think one of them might be a
little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:19.020> more<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> other<00:01:19.320> amount<00:01:19.619> hundred

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
little bit more the other amount hundred

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.460 
little bit more the other amount hundred
sure<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.420> also<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.930> time<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.439> which

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sure on that also the time in which

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.620 
sure on that also the time in which
whenever<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.340> fire<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> scan<00:01:24.000> bolt<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
whenever you fire the scan bolt off and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
whenever you fire the scan bolt off and
it<00:01:24.960> does<00:01:25.140> spot<00:01:25.380> an<00:01:25.500> enemy<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> mini-map

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it does spot an enemy on the mini-map

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
it does spot an enemy on the mini-map
its<00:01:26.580> around<00:01:26.909> six<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> eight<00:01:27.600> seconds<00:01:28.080> they

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
its around six to eight seconds they

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
its around six to eight seconds they
will<00:01:28.350> stay<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.890> before<00:01:29.340> disappearing

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
will stay on there before disappearing

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
will stay on there before disappearing
think<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.630> last<00:01:30.810> video<00:01:31.079> said<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.409> around

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
think my last video said it was around

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.280 
think my last video said it was around
three<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> five<00:01:32.159> probably<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.729> miscounted

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
three to five probably just miscounted

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.210 
three to five probably just miscounted
appears<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.439> around<00:01:34.590> six<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> eight

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
appears to be around six to eight

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
appears to be around six to eight
seconds<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.090> enemy<00:01:36.390> will<00:01:36.540> stay<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
seconds the enemy will stay on the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560 
seconds the enemy will stay on the
mini-map<00:01:37.229> before<00:01:37.650> disappearing<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
mini-map before disappearing so what is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.330 
mini-map before disappearing so what is
it<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.110> good<00:01:40.320> about<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:40.770> scan<00:01:41.009> bolts

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it that's so good about these scan bolts

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370 
it that's so good about these scan bolts
that<00:01:41.520> even<00:01:41.790> makes<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.720> use<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> why

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that even makes you really use it why

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.749 
that even makes you really use it why
should<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:43.860> over<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:44.490> two<00:01:44.610> piece

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
should you use over the other two piece

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
should you use over the other two piece
of<00:01:44.880> equipment<00:01:45.240> well<00:01:45.600> first<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
of equipment well first of all it's a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.510 
of equipment well first of all it's a
lot<00:01:46.409> more<00:01:46.560> mobile<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:46.950> since<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.490> have

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
lot more mobile and since you don't have

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.859 
lot more mobile and since you don't have
to<00:01:47.670> worry<00:01:47.759> about<00:01:47.820> picking<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> moving

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
