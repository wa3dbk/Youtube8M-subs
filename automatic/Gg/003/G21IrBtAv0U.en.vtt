take a breather because I've done I've

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.930 
take a breather because I've done I've
made<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.010> mistake<00:00:38.070> several<00:00:38.610> times<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
made that mistake several times in

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819 
made that mistake several times in
tournaments<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:39.809> I've<00:00:40.079> lost<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.710> then

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
tournaments where I've lost and then

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.080 
tournaments where I've lost and then
immediately<00:00:41.219> play<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.550> next<00:00:41.760> match<00:00:41.879> because

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
immediately play my next match because

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520 
immediately play my next match because
I'm<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.300> forget<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.410> gonna

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I'm like forget it like I'm just gonna

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.779 
I'm like forget it like I'm just gonna
shake<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:43.950> try<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> own<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.520> dude

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
shake it off and try to own this dude

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
shake it off and try to own this dude
and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.899> killed<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:46.410> get

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and then I get killed and then get

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
and then I get killed and then get
eliminated<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.370> home<00:00:47.520> selfish<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
eliminated and then go home selfish so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
eliminated and then go home selfish so
it<00:00:49.739> looks<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.219> looks<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.180> Mike<00:00:51.510> would

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it looks like looks like Mike would

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.959 
it looks like looks like Mike would
rather<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.230> continue<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> momentum

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
rather just continue with the momentum

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
rather just continue with the momentum
since<00:00:54.420> he<00:00:54.600> already<00:00:54.840> has<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.140> Ryu<00:00:55.680> match<00:00:55.860> on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
since he already has the Ryu match on

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720 
since he already has the Ryu match on
the<00:00:56.340> brain<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.129> he<00:00:59.399> does<00:00:59.579> know

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the brain it's you know he does know

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
the brain it's you know he does know
this<00:00:59.879> match<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.570> he<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.320> he

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
this match very well he you know he

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.109 
this match very well he you know he
obviously<00:01:02.100> has<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> ton<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> experience<00:01:05.090> ton<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
obviously has a ton of experience ton of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.510 
obviously has a ton of experience ton of
experience<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.439> real<00:01:07.619> match<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
experience in the real match up so I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
experience in the real match up so I
guess<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.030> better<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.450> switch<00:01:10.409> from

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
guess it's better to just switch from

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.230 
guess it's better to just switch from
one<00:01:10.770> ryu<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> another<00:01:11.460> without<00:01:11.790> taking<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
one ryu to another without taking a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
one ryu to another without taking a
break<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.200> i'll<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.890> next<00:01:14.220> against

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
break so i'll be going up next against

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
break so i'll be going up next against

and<00:01:44.280> he's<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.090> good<00:01:45.470> he's<00:01:46.470> really

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and he's got a really good he's really

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
and he's got a really good he's really
got<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.189> lead<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.390> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
got a really good lead right here so all

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.969 
got a really good lead right here so all
he's<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.560> stay<00:01:49.740> patient

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
he's got to do is kind of stay patient

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.690 
he's got to do is kind of stay patient
and<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.299> hit<00:01:51.509> by<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:52.170> uppercut<00:01:53.100> f-80c

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and not get hit by a uppercut f-80c

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.190 
and not get hit by a uppercut f-80c
probably<00:01:54.149> best<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> stay<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> ground

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
probably best to stay on the ground

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.740 
probably best to stay on the ground
oh<00:01:56.310> man<00:01:57.549> now<00:01:57.939> looking<00:01:58.210> good<00:01:58.330> here<00:01:58.509> for<00:01:58.659> round

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
oh man now looking good here for round

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.910 
oh man now looking good here for round
one<00:01:59.020> for<00:01:59.200> air<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.880> he<00:02:01.689> does<00:02:01.960> burn<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.770> two

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
one for air if he does burn the two

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.670 
one for air if he does burn the two
meters<00:02:03.280> he<00:02:04.210> will<00:02:04.509> probably<00:02:04.810> be<00:02:05.170> at<00:02:05.320> our<00:02:05.470> meter

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
meters he will probably be at our meter

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.279 
meters he will probably be at our meter
disadvantage<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.850> next<00:02:07.060> round<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.869> air

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
disadvantage for the next round so air

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.089 
disadvantage for the next round so air
is<00:02:08.319> probably<00:02:09.009> not<00:02:09.190> likely<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.670> use<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.179> meter

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
is probably not likely to use the meter

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.530 
is probably not likely to use the meter
probably<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.280> better<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.730> take<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.360> loss

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
probably just better to take the loss

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.620 
probably just better to take the loss
and<00:02:13.750> start<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.530> next<00:02:15.069> round<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:16.000> full

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and start the next round with a full

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.840 
and start the next round with a full
meter<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.739> that's<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:18.459> he's<00:02:18.550> going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.700> do

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
meter and that's what he's going to do

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.850 
meter and that's what he's going to do
so<00:02:19.060> both<00:02:19.870> players<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.410> go<00:02:20.560> into<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
so both players going to go into the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.650 
so both players going to go into the
second<00:02:21.160> round<00:02:21.280> now<00:02:21.489> I'll<00:02:21.760> tie<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.030> up<00:02:22.209> just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
second round now I'll tie it up just

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.030 
second round now I'll tie it up just
about<00:02:22.810> tied<00:02:23.050> up<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.319> meter<00:02:23.530> oh<00:02:27.780> man<00:02:28.920> we'll<00:02:29.920> see

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
about tied up on meter oh man we'll see

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
about tied up on meter oh man we'll see
Mikey<00:02:30.280> Oh<00:02:30.519> Mike<00:02:30.730> decides<00:02:31.180> not<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.420> use<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
Mikey Oh Mike decides not to use the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.289 
Mikey Oh Mike decides not to use the
super<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.350> early<00:02:32.709> now<00:02:32.860> he<00:02:32.920> might<00:02:33.190> option<00:02:33.610> no<00:02:33.970> oh

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
super so early now he might option no oh

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.300 
super so early now he might option no oh
wow<00:02:34.660> Oh<00:02:35.519> Mike<00:02:36.569> just<00:02:37.569> baits<00:02:38.049> out<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.530> uppercut

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
wow Oh Mike just baits out the uppercut

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.870 
wow Oh Mike just baits out the uppercut
just<00:02:40.380> takes<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.530> step<00:02:41.590> back<00:02:41.799> oh<00:02:42.549> my<00:02:43.360> god<00:02:43.780> Mike<00:02:44.080> oh

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
just takes a step back oh my god Mike oh

just takes a step back oh my god Mike oh
my<00:02:45.880> god<00:02:46.120> okay<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.019> guess<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:47.620> see<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.100> logic

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
my god okay I guess now we see the logic

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.220 
my god okay I guess now we see the logic
right<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.970> mean<00:02:49.709> obviously<00:02:50.709> air<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:52.230> probably

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
right I mean obviously air is probably

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.740 
right I mean obviously air is probably
the<00:02:53.440> best<00:02:53.709> oh<00:02:53.920> man<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.850> unblockable

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the best oh man and the unblockable

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.309 
the best oh man and the unblockable
Tatsu<00:02:56.700> process<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.790> Tatsu<00:02:58.150> continues<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.200> now

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
Tatsu process of Tatsu continues but now

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.849 
Tatsu process of Tatsu continues but now
air<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.950> out<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.310> meter<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.180> he<00:03:01.720> has<00:03:01.840> one<00:03:02.140> chip

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
air is out of meter and he has one chip

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.640 
air is out of meter and he has one chip
away<00:03:03.340> what<00:03:03.970> no<00:03:04.180> one<00:03:04.690> block<00:03:05.019> special<00:03:05.380> move<00:03:05.530> away

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
away what no one block special move away

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.740 
away what no one block special move away
from<00:03:06.310> losing<00:03:06.549> this<00:03:06.820> first<00:03:07.060> game<00:03:07.299> all<00:03:07.630> right

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
from losing this first game all right

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.370 
from losing this first game all right
there<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.019> go<00:03:09.329> Mike<00:03:10.329> takes<00:03:10.600> first<00:03:10.870> game<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
there we go Mike takes first game and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.349 
there we go Mike takes first game and
you<00:03:11.530> guys<00:03:11.709> can<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.579> know<00:03:12.609> you<00:03:12.760> guys<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.209> see

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
you guys can you know you guys can see

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.110 
you guys can you know you guys can see
the<00:03:13.480> importance<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.049> meter<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.709> match

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the importance of meter in this match

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.060 
the importance of meter in this match
even<00:03:16.120> after<00:03:16.510> air<00:03:16.780> hit<00:03:17.350> with<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> cross<00:03:17.890> up

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
even after air hit with the cross up

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.090 
even after air hit with the cross up
Tatsu<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.730> then<00:03:18.850> went<00:03:19.060> into<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.780> super<00:03:20.440> he

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
Tatsu and then went into the super he

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800 
Tatsu and then went into the super he
was<00:03:21.220> all<00:03:21.370> tapped<00:03:21.609> out<00:03:21.790> at<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.150> point<00:03:22.420> even

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
was all tapped out at that point even

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.910 
was all tapped out at that point even
though<00:03:22.959> he<00:03:23.049> had<00:03:23.200> him<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.470> corner<00:03:23.769> there

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
though he had him in the corner there

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.520 
though he had him in the corner there
was<00:03:24.040> nothing<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.370> he<00:03:24.609> could<00:03:24.640> have<00:03:24.910> hit<00:03:25.150> him

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
was nothing that he could have hit him

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.990 
was nothing that he could have hit him
juggled<00:03:26.530> him<00:03:26.620> with<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:27.370> connect<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.730> ultra

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
juggled him with to connect the ultra

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.310 
juggled him with to connect the ultra
afterwards<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:31.600> was<00:03:31.690> probably<00:03:31.989> still<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
afterwards so it was probably still the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.949 
afterwards so it was probably still the
right<00:03:32.470> thing<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> do<00:03:33.269> but<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.359> meter<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.750> just

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
right thing to do but the meter is just

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.770 
right thing to do but the meter is just
so<00:03:35.140> important

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.780 

oh<00:03:38.160> no<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.560> think<00:03:42.100> Mike<00:03:42.310> thought<00:03:42.520> he<00:03:42.670> was

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
oh no I I think Mike thought he was

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.660 
oh no I I think Mike thought he was
going<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.000> do<00:03:43.090> something<00:03:43.300> else<00:03:43.510> right<00:03:43.570> there<00:03:43.900> I

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
going to do something else right there I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.620 
going to do something else right there I
ever<00:03:45.670> forgot<00:03:45.970> how<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.120> punish<00:03:46.420> that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
ever forgot how to punish that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.220 
ever forgot how to punish that
apparently<00:03:47.050> oh<00:03:47.320> no<00:03:48.040> Mike<00:03:48.310> misses<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:49.330> thought

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
apparently oh no Mike misses I thought
