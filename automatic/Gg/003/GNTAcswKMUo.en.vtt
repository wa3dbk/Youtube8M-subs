00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.070
 ivÃ¡n once this law the dance 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.790
 lounge you see a window like this 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.370
 here what we are going to say to the xbox is 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.010
 Do not start the freestyle every time 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.330
 that the pse ignites not that it does 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.500
 automatically 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.570
 so what we are going to do is in 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 routes we give to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.630
 and we go to the default section here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 If you realize, I have the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.040
 folder assigned to the folder where 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.650
 I have the freestyle of what you do 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.530
 is to put it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.530
 Search as if you were in 6 - search 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.260
 where the folder where you have the 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:48.180
 freestyle and 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.040
 read where the sexy default was 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.490
 once you give him where is the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.980
 default sex he will stay with the route 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.560
 in which he is going to start these other 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.660
 options are for when you start the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.090
 console with the button to bl x on that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.769
 good other options that you can 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.929
 give 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.670
 then what is in this point already 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.560
 we say where is the folder of the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.289
 freestyle and what we do is that with the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.289
 control button rbd here comes out 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.550
 of the buttons that we are going to use with the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550
 rv we move 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.700
 to this window here in this window what 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.329
 what we have to do is save the down 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.590
 in and that because we just created 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.920
 then where are we going to keep what 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.140
 I have saved on the hard drive in the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.650
 internal memory of the xbox and in memory 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.570
 flash 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.460
 the houses to keep it simply we 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 we stop on the hard drive and what 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.540
 first x 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.520
 with x and we will be saved the same 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.080
 if you waited about 5 seconds it's going 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.090
 to leave the options if you give yourself 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.619
 account the download the launch or of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.610
 leave x save the give and then there you 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.150
 We give x we â€‹â€‹give him x on the hard drive 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.570
 in the slim in memory if you do not have 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.910
 voice is old suddenly and in memory 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.610
 phrase but keep us because the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.860
 I really do not know exactly which one to go 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.960
 but why do the three of them keep it 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.220
 then when we finish we give it to 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.490
 the b button is already going to restart us 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.040
 Here we can configure other things to 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.440
 the console but it's good that you read and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.660
 as you want your console to 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.630
 behave those days 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.630
 Poquitico more than reading are not have 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.980
 complicate and here what I said 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.500
 yesterday is for example in behavior 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.240
 of the console is where you can 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.490
 give him 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.490
 for example the compact is him 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.319
 the lock unlocks the pin no no no 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.680
 not what I do is like being guided by the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.680
 ping 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.510
 if you need me to give you this data 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.430
 well that I sent him or some photos 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.730
 because they are not as heavy as I of 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.129
 I have and you have to know what everything is 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.780
 you stand on the option and here 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.390
 the description below will appear each 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.890
 one of the things if there are things that do not 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.710
 he is very sure he does not know better not the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.680
 there are no rules, there are criticisms 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.379
 so 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.329
 pretty ready to do it from route routes 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.640
 what comes and saves him or first 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.079
 once and in is going to restart a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.079
 restart the bah 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.040
 to take the route that you taught him there 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.480
 in default, I hope it serves you if the 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.620
 product has some doubt is not right 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.950
 the fresh video writes to me and I come back and 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.950
 I send it
