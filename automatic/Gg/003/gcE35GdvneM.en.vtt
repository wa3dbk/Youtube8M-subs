00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
girl the reason I hate eye stuff is just

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.740 
girl the reason I hate eye stuff is just
cuz<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.799> get<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.280> shaky<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.970> can't<00:02:15.360> even<00:02:15.450> put

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
cuz I get so shaky I can't even put

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.569 
cuz I get so shaky I can't even put
eyedrops<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.380> my<00:02:16.530> eye<00:02:16.560> without<00:02:16.890> squirming<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
eyedrops in my eye without squirming and

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:52.930 
eyedrops in my eye without squirming and
now<00:02:18.000> my<00:02:18.569> least<00:02:18.810> favorite<00:02:19.349> eyeliner

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.199 

okay

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
okay

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.240 
okay
so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.510> rarely<00:02:54.870> wear<00:02:55.230> eyeliner<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.010> I'm

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so I rarely wear eyeliner and I'm

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.949 
so I rarely wear eyeliner and I'm
guessing<00:02:57.060> you're<00:02:57.180> supposed<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.569> curl<00:02:57.900> your

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
guessing you're supposed to curl your

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.500 
guessing you're supposed to curl your
eyelashes<00:02:58.620> afterwards<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.329> don't

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
eyelashes afterwards so that you don't

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.690 
eyelashes afterwards so that you don't
get<00:03:01.230> them<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> way<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.100> eye<00:03:02.220> tight<00:03:02.519> I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
get them in the way and eye tight I

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.309 
get them in the way and eye tight I
think<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.090> did<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> wrong<00:03:03.810> order<00:03:04.109> but

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
think I did that in the wrong order but

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.729 
think I did that in the wrong order but
