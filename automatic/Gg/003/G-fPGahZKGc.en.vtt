high<00:01:19.049> ground<00:01:19.350> seems<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.009> something<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
high ground seems to be something that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
high ground seems to be something that
you<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.900> only<00:01:22.080> because

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you really want to have not only because

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
you really want to have not only because
of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> power<00:01:22.830> weapons<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.759> there's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of the power weapons but because there's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
of the power weapons but because there's
always<00:01:24.780> options<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.189> run<00:01:26.400> away<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
always options for you to run away so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 
always options for you to run away so
you<00:01:26.880> could<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.869> they<00:01:28.110> weren't<00:01:28.320> able<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you could see that they weren't able to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
you could see that they weren't able to
get<00:01:29.460> me<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> choke<00:01:29.880> point<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.329> i<00:01:30.509> miss<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
get me a choke point there i miss the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.359 
get me a choke point there i miss the
mantle<00:01:31.259> kick<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.829> guy<00:01:31.979> cut<00:01:32.220> me<00:01:32.250> off

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
mantle kick when this guy cut me off

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
mantle kick when this guy cut me off
which<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.060> smart<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> him<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.740> male

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
which was very smart of him but the male

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.219 
which was very smart of him but the male
kick<00:01:35.310> gave<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.640> enough<00:01:35.939> momentum<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.509> pick<00:01:37.110> him

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
kick gave me enough momentum to pick him

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
kick gave me enough momentum to pick him
off<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> shotgun<00:01:37.950> roll<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:39.210> guy's

charging<00:01:39.810> his<00:01:39.900> torque<00:01:40.140> bow<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.500> easier<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
charging his torque bow it's easier to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
charging his torque bow it's easier to
snipe<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> torque<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> first<00:01:42.180> shot

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and as soon as I picked the one guy off

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
and as soon as I picked the one guy off
I<00:02:31.100> know<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.340> want<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.670> back<00:02:31.850> off<00:02:32.060> because<00:02:32.300> i'm<00:02:32.390> in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
I know I want to back off because i'm in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.970 
I know I want to back off because i'm in
a<00:02:32.570> shitty<00:02:32.600> position<00:02:33.050> but<00:02:33.440> he<00:02:33.500> gets<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.770> sniper

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
a shitty position but he gets a sniper

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.010 
a shitty position but he gets a sniper
shot<00:02:34.220> off<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.490> i<00:02:34.520> figured<00:02:34.850> he'd<00:02:35.030> chase<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.990> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
shot off so i figured he'd chase so I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.720 
shot off so i figured he'd chase so I
hold<00:02:36.260> my<00:02:36.410> ground<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.920> get<00:02:37.100> off<00:02:37.190> some<00:02:37.370> solid

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
hold my ground and I get off some solid

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.220 
hold my ground and I get off some solid
shots<00:02:38.000> here<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.330> gets<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.570> little<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.870> messy

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230

now<00:02:46.310> I'm<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.300> grab<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.660> digger<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.110> was

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
now I'm going to grab the digger I was

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.780 
now I'm going to grab the digger I was
pretty<00:02:48.590> panicky<00:02:49.130> at<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.370> point<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:49.760> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
pretty panicky at this point so I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.280 
pretty panicky at this point so I
actually<00:02:49.970> should<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.480> graph<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:50.900> I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
actually should do graph to the right I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.740 
actually should do graph to the right I
thinking<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.040> heard<00:02:52.280> somebody<00:02:52.550> but<00:02:53.030> now<00:02:53.570> I'm

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
thinking I heard somebody but now I'm

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.110 
thinking I heard somebody but now I'm
just<00:02:53.960> kind<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.230> getting<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.560> feel<00:02:54.800> for<00:02:55.030> what<00:02:56.030> I'm

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
just kind of getting a feel for what I'm

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.460 
just kind of getting a feel for what I'm
up<00:02:56.330> against<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.020> second<00:02:57.320> I'm<00:02:57.380> going

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
up against and then the second I'm going

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.990 
up against and then the second I'm going
to<00:02:57.560> see<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.890> guy<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.250> right<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.760> saw<00:02:58.940> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
to see one guy my right and I saw the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.430 
to see one guy my right and I saw the
brief<00:02:59.270> shot<00:02:59.450> get<00:02:59.630> picked<00:02:59.840> up<00:02:59.960> and<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.260> don't

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
brief shot get picked up and I don't

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.560 
brief shot get picked up and I don't
like<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.070> idea<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.520> me<00:03:01.580> getting<00:03:01.790> sandwich<00:03:02.360> so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
like the idea of me getting sandwich so

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.300 
like the idea of me getting sandwich so
I<00:03:02.600> just<00:03:02.900> bail<00:03:03.080> out<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:03.500> super<00:03:03.800> fast<00:03:03.830> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
I just bail out of there super fast and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.460 
I just bail out of there super fast and
I'm<00:03:04.850> gonna<00:03:05.000> flank<00:03:05.390> back<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.870> through<00:03:06.230> digger

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
I'm gonna flank back up through digger

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.770 
I'm gonna flank back up through digger
and<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.760> going<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.000> pay<00:03:08.180> off<00:03:08.210> in<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.570> sec

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and that is going to pay off in a sec

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.440 
and that is going to pay off in a sec
because<00:03:09.200> they're<00:03:10.010> both<00:03:10.250> facing<00:03:11.030> one<00:03:11.420> way

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
because they're both facing one way

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.480 
because they're both facing one way
which<00:03:11.780> means<00:03:12.080> they're<00:03:13.040> going<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.370> to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
which means they're going to have to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.010 
which means they're going to have to
come<00:03:13.670> find<00:03:13.910> me<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.240> guy<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.480> about<00:03:14.960> to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
creep up on me and I get a nice digger

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.630 
creep up on me and I get a nice digger

stopped<00:03:20.060> playing<00:03:20.960> I<00:03:21.110> don't<00:03:21.290> know<00:03:21.350> why<00:03:21.500> he

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
stopped playing I don't know why he

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.040 
stopped playing I don't know why he
decided<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.100> maybe<00:03:22.400> he<00:03:22.610> just<00:03:22.810> wanted<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.930> be

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
decided to maybe he just wanted to be

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.170 
decided to maybe he just wanted to be
outside<00:03:24.380> before<00:03:24.710> he<00:03:25.010> died<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.880> just

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
outside before he died and I just

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.580 
outside before he died and I just
traveled<00:03:26.570> around<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.020> map<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.350> it's<00:03:27.470> just

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
traveled around the map so it's just

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.660 
traveled around the map so it's just
good<00:03:27.710> to<00:03:27.740> mention<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.310> you're<00:03:28.490> having

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
good to mention that if you're having

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.250 
good to mention that if you're having
trouble<00:03:28.790> finding<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.330> last<00:03:29.510> guy<00:03:29.690> spawn<00:03:30.020> area

trouble finding the last guy spawn area

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.340 
trouble finding the last guy spawn area
is<00:03:30.560> normally<00:03:31.430> where<00:03:32.300> you'll<00:03:32.480> find<00:03:32.540> people<00:03:32.930> if

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
is normally where you'll find people if

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.870 
is normally where you'll find people if
they're<00:03:33.590> not<00:03:33.740> playing<00:03:33.980> or<00:03:34.160> maybe<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.550> clutch

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
they're not playing or maybe the clutch

they're not playing or maybe the clutch

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
room the library I don't want to talk

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.380 
room the library I don't want to talk
about<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.160> got<00:03:37.310> a3<00:03:37.550> b1<00:03:37.730> half<00:03:38.090> sniper

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390

weapons<00:03:40.850> really<00:03:41.630> help<00:03:41.810> with<00:03:41.990> clutches<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.740> also

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
weapons really help with clutches I also

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.850 
weapons really help with clutches I also
said<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.210> past<00:03:44.480> because<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:45.590> you're<00:03:45.710> just

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
said this in past because if you're just

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.110 
said this in past because if you're just
stuck<00:03:46.100> with<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.310> shotgun<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:46.820> smoke

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120

grenades<00:03:47.390> can<00:03:47.570> be<00:03:47.690> very<00:03:47.900> hard<00:03:48.080> for<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.320> to

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
grenades can be very hard for you to

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.020 
grenades can be very hard for you to
make<00:03:48.530> something<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.310> don't<00:03:49.760> want<00:03:49.910> the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
make something of it I don't want the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.390 
make something of it I don't want the
one<00:03:50.390> opportunity<00:03:50.750> there<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:51.860> always

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
one opportunity there it's always

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.980 
one opportunity there it's always
important<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.850> capitalize<00:03:53.360> on<00:03:53.390> those<00:03:53.630> 1b1

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
important to capitalize on those 1b1

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.530 
important to capitalize on those 1b1
opportunities<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.880> know<00:03:55.940> his<00:03:56.180> teammates

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
opportunities and I know his teammates

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.090 
opportunities and I know his teammates
are<00:03:56.660> gonna<00:03:56.750> come<00:03:56.960> exploring<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.830> just

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
are gonna come exploring because I just

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.230 
are gonna come exploring because I just
killed<00:03:58.310> him<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.700> I'm<00:03:58.760> gonna<00:03:58.850> try<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.120> get

killed him here and I'm gonna try to get
another<00:03:59.360> 1<00:03:59.810> v1<00:04:00.020> opportunity<00:04:00.620> here<00:04:00.770> I<00:04:00.830> thought

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
another 1 v1 opportunity here I thought

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.830 
another 1 v1 opportunity here I thought
I<00:04:01.220> had<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:01.550> but<00:04:02.180> his<00:04:02.270> teammates<00:04:02.570> actually

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
I had it but his teammates actually

I'm<00:05:07.099> going<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.729> mission<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.419> all<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:08.900> way<00:05:09.050> to

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
I'm going to mission it all the way to

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.899 
I'm going to mission it all the way to
the<00:05:09.349> top<00:05:09.529> of<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.710> map<00:05:09.949> because<00:05:10.340> like<00:05:10.759> I<00:05:10.849> said

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
the top of the map because like I said

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.459 
the top of the map because like I said
before<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.449> don't<00:05:11.779> like<00:05:11.900> being<00:05:12.139> at<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:12.319> bottom

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:12.469 
before I don't like being at the bottom

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.839 
before I don't like being at the bottom
of<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.770> map<00:05:12.949> it<00:05:13.099> just<00:05:13.279> makes<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.550> harder<00:05:13.610> for

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
of the map it just makes it harder for

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.189 
of the map it just makes it harder for
you<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.060> keep<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.300> tab<00:05:14.509> on<00:05:14.539> everybody<00:05:15.050> else

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
you to keep a tab on everybody else

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.330 
you to keep a tab on everybody else
because<00:05:15.349> they<00:05:15.439> can<00:05:15.560> hop<00:05:15.740> down<00:05:15.889> at<00:05:16.069> you<00:05:16.129> at<00:05:16.219> any

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
because they can hop down at you at any

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.830 
because they can hop down at you at any
time<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.849> there's<00:05:17.000> no<00:05:17.150> really<00:05:17.419> there's<00:05:17.750> no

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
time and there's no really there's no

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.360 
time and there's no really there's no
real<00:05:18.020> room<00:05:18.229> for<00:05:18.409> you<00:05:18.469> to<00:05:18.529> escape<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.159> now<00:05:19.279> i'm

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
real room for you to escape and now i'm

trying to find everybody because

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:21.939 
trying to find everybody because
generally<00:05:21.020> speaking<00:05:21.229> people<00:05:21.409> don't<00:05:21.680> go<00:05:21.770> up<00:05:21.860> to

shot yet because i know i'm not going to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.879 
shot yet because i know i'm not going to
be<00:05:29.300> able<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.509> pick<00:05:29.629> all<00:05:29.779> the<00:05:29.900> head<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.620> I<00:05:30.680> want

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
be able to pick all the head and I want

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.800 
be able to pick all the head and I want
to<00:05:30.949> keep<00:05:31.039> the<00:05:31.159> element<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:31.520> surprise<00:05:31.659> this<00:05:32.659> guy

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
to keep the element of surprise this guy

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.430 
to keep the element of surprise this guy
pushes<00:05:33.229> me<00:05:33.379> as<00:05:33.500> soon<00:05:33.710> as<00:05:33.860> he<00:05:34.039> he<00:05:34.520> sees<00:05:34.729> me

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
pushes me as soon as he he sees me

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.809 
pushes me as soon as he he sees me
probably<00:05:36.440> thinking<00:05:36.860> that<00:05:37.069> they<00:05:37.400> had<00:05:37.490> strength

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
probably thinking that they had strength

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.779 
probably thinking that they had strength
in<00:05:38.000> numbers<00:05:38.029> which<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.229> a<00:05:39.440> very<00:05:39.889> bad<00:05:40.069> idea<00:05:40.129> this

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
in numbers which is a very bad idea this

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.610 
in numbers which is a very bad idea this
is<00:05:40.940> actually<00:05:41.240> just<00:05:41.360> flat-out<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:42.050> stupid<00:05:42.440> push

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
is actually just flat-out a stupid push

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.379 
is actually just flat-out a stupid push
he<00:05:43.250> might<00:05:43.400> have<00:05:43.520> thought<00:05:43.639> I<00:05:43.699> was<00:05:43.819> weak<00:05:44.150> but<00:05:44.180> I

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
he might have thought I was weak but I

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.820 
he might have thought I was weak but I
had<00:05:44.569> a<00:05:44.599> smoke<00:05:44.870> stun<00:05:45.139> on<00:05:45.289> him<00:05:45.409> and<00:05:45.529> if<00:05:45.589> you<00:05:45.680> could

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
had a smoke stun on him and if you could

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.140 
had a smoke stun on him and if you could
see<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.039> was<00:05:46.129> actually<00:05:46.400> two<00:05:46.580> second<00:05:46.909> smokes

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
see it was actually two second smokes

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.059 
see it was actually two second smokes
done<00:05:47.360> because<00:05:47.629> this<00:05:48.199> is<00:05:48.349> before<00:05:48.589> the<00:05:48.919> update

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
done because this is before the update

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.950 
done because this is before the update
happen<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.729> was<00:05:50.180> afraid<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.479> this<00:05:50.719> guy<00:05:50.900> would

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
happen I was afraid that this guy would

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.959 
happen I was afraid that this guy would
creep<00:05:51.259> up<00:05:51.440> on<00:05:51.560> me<00:05:51.620> from<00:05:52.250> high<00:05:52.400> ground<00:05:52.699> so<00:05:52.879> I

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
creep up on me from high ground so I

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.490 
creep up on me from high ground so I
back<00:05:53.210> off<00:05:53.419> because<00:05:53.659> I<00:05:53.870> know<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.080> don't<00:05:54.199> have

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
back off because I know I don't have

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.959 
back off because I know I don't have
right<00:05:54.740> hand<00:05:54.949> advantage<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.610> I<00:05:55.669> was<00:05:55.819> not

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
right hand advantage and I was not

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.540 
right hand advantage and I was not
comfortable<00:05:56.210> having<00:05:57.139> a<00:05:57.770> sniper<00:05:58.069> battle<00:05:58.310> with

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
comfortable having a sniper battle with

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.709 
comfortable having a sniper battle with
him<00:05:58.669> so<00:05:58.699> I'm<00:05:58.939> trying<00:05:59.150> to<00:05:59.240> see<00:05:59.360> if<00:05:59.449> I<00:05:59.539> can

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
him so I'm trying to see if I can

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.929 
him so I'm trying to see if I can
reposition<00:06:00.110> myself<00:06:00.379> for<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:00.860> better<00:06:01.069> shot<00:06:01.460> and
