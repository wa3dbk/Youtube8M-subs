00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.799
 breastfeed and wanted or thought so 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 Actually, I could give you a few 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.000
 Recipes show how I like the home 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.759
 I ice at home like I do at home 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.049
 self- prepared vital substances with 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.660
 vitamins and not any too 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 put many mothers out of the supermarket 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 watch me and definitely buy too 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 I would like to ice up regularly at some point 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.970
 talk to you in a certain way or 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 I want to enlighten you a bit 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 like that with the composition of ice 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.090
 That's what your husband looks like the supermarket 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.739
 go again and buy as your children 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 today look at the ingredients list 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
 water what is in it all in the ice cream parlor 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 it is the same as you usually know 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 not at all what's in it most of the time 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.289
 consists mainly of chemistry 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 nothing natural that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.530
 skimmed milk powder in it then has 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.440
 nothing more to do with nothing up there 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.629
 processed beyond recognition 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.399
 processed with chemistry added there are 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.020
 always fools trainer so that everything is so 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.600
 nice smooth and holds 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 these emulsifiers also consist soja 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.989
 almost always in chocolate bars 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.129
 always have to read in the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 Ingredients there is also mostly 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.869
 emulsifier so yes we could already be ten 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.010
 games here at the window maybe i am 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.549
 I'm overexposed by the sun 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.840
 outside and when the engines are in there 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.020
 and still so much 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 that is quite certain 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.030
 Genmanipulierte therefore I do not believe 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 that the egg manufacturers are struggling 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.180
 give 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
 to use soy which does not go mine 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.130
 Political it is all too expensive then 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.450
 there are different numbers in there i 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.220
 do not want to enumerate now that is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.420
 a really many, many things in it that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.520
 just are not good for the body 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.530
 the liver are at in suspicion 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 Enlarge bad line are so 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.869
 stressful for the body so I have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.640
 Of course, often ice cream from the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.829
 Supermarket bought and always does 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 still now and then I get from 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.320
 Eiscafe my children to buy an ice cream 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.509
 I do not want to be like that anymore 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.799
 I do not overdo it 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.600
 with the strict yes and then mine 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.360
 child crying in the ice cream parlor because everyone 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.030
 Children ice cream is not so warm 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 is waiting now is your home 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.490
 I buy them from time to time but the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649
 ice out there just when the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.380
 city ​​and it takes a bit 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.300
 I do that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.860
 So it was not such a video right now 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.870
 be you are all stupid tree that costs 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 I still do it myself now and then 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.220
 I visit to a minimum 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.650
 reduce and really do it very often 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.210
 the ice at home I can do it now 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.650
 finish what you need to do it 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.430
 sometimes needs mixa for that 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.570
 reached bar mixer or if you mixa 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.830
 he does not even have to be strong 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.660
 be it unless you still want it 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.210
 mix wild herbs with yes that is synonymous 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.230
 but what you need are fruits for it 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.180
 breakfast 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.800
 but it does not have to be because fresher 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.470
 are already big enough you can need 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.000
 for example only bananas and then there 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.230
 The coat has to be added very often 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.220
 it has to be almonds because it's a bit like that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.980
 everything can be refined as well 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.630
 peanut butter butter hazelnut must be so 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.390
 depending on what you just want but 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.130
 I think you have to be delicious and 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.510
 fits the 1 a bit with vanilla 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.010
 refine so there is also on it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 Make sure that you buy high quality goods 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.400
 me as well as a cheap vanilla should 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.620
 that moves me now so the little one 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.060
 skat and drink yes so there is to 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.580
 an example is just a recipe 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.860
 banana mandl must with the change of 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.510
 previous example, and there is ice 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.840
 rhine is about to sell 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.840
 Put it in the fridge and you're done 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.530
 then you could find a mango 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.710
 I also very sweet mango with almond 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.720
 Moss and cinnamon vanilla is also very 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.400
 delicious you can different colors 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.750
 not too close to my face is always 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.160
 bad i hate that so close 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.920
 my face gets the camera but 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.350
 I've got my degree in hand with the thing 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.060
 here 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.440

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.940
 has stopped at the one where you 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.380
 exactly one cooperates 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.080
 Here you can see the duvet and everything 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.230
 in the background but no matter you cooperate 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.330
 you can give everything there is still there 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.130
 this one hot what my son always likes 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.580
 I have it pretty much so far 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.140
 to buy 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.570
 what is the name of the meat in cups 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.760
 bottled and the blue or red so he 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.770
 sometimes blue or the green in ours 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.240
 There is always a shopping mall and it 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.280
 it looks like it's out 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.590
 ice cubes exist and with dyes 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.000
 provided and then simply chatted 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.900
 You can then with spoon then has 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.520
 or with the straw 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.720
 you can do that yourself too, so you can 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.209
 could now for example just the 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.519
 melon a peace small pieces 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.270
 nixon you have it ever you stop 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.370
 in red otherwise as mentioned fruits 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.900
 just take different fruits and 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.819
 Who still likes wild herbs? 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.889
 For example, when I run a lot, I run a lot 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.870
 lukas bit that gets too bitter 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.449
 some pieces at some point 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.500
 or leaves and mix 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.660
 but for that you need a strong one 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.190
 Of course I change what I often do 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.410
 I'm just puree a blender 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.150
 the strawberries may give one 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.729

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.099
 I still give bananas strawberries and still 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.340

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.210
 Strawberry banana is so delicious 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.490
 really very creamy than that is 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.950
 Now these are like mango mix with 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.320
 avocado and it is the strawberry mixture 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.730

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.180
 really easy you can get 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.780
 make tasty, vital-rich travel 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.640
 where you're only satisfied then 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.970
 must not have patches that certain 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.230
 he knows that is mine , of course 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.640
 children do not lose this now and 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.300
 say you do not get ice makes it 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.040
 not round 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.600
 but if i see something there for 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.060
 Ingredients are in the ice cream parlors 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.730
 or supermarket then maybe 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.990
 not that child can be sick so well 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.280
 it may be that some thinks are rotten 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.810
 But if you are so the exaggerated 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.310
 People are watching and the Chinese are almost there 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.200
 everyone is sick so almost everyone has something 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.910
 You do not look at it as a disease 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.100
 So if a child had a rash with 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.100
 The tenant then you do not see them 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.110
