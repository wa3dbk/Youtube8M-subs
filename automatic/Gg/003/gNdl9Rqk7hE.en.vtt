Pentax and for you let's suppose the
first<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:23.130> an<00:00:23.279> M<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.850> mean<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
first one that's an M I mean that's in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050 
first one that's an M I mean that's in
KML<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.189> already<00:00:26.460> been<00:00:26.550> converted<00:00:27.029> to

canon<00:00:27.930> eos<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> Pentek<00:00:31.529> lens<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
canon eos this is the Pentek lens and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.930 
canon eos this is the Pentek lens and
then<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:34.100> adapter<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.280> mount<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
then this is the adapter to mount it to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.530 
then this is the adapter to mount it to
to<00:00:36.870> any<00:00:37.050> Canon<00:00:37.559> EOS<00:00:37.890> body<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> things

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to any Canon EOS body but the things

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
to any Canon EOS body but the things
that<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.410> make<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.649> work<00:00:40.800> though<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that I do to make it work though is the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340 
that I do to make it work though is the
it<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.450> aperture<00:00:42.809> pin<00:00:42.989> right<00:00:43.110> here

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it has a little aperture pin right here

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.150 
it has a little aperture pin right here
I<00:00:43.469> had<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.300> bend<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.960> fit<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.320> body<00:00:46.350> if

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I had a bend it down to fit my body if

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
I had a bend it down to fit my body if
you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.850> Canon<00:00:48.329> crop<00:00:48.719> body<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.260> might<00:00:49.500> not

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you have a Canon crop body you might not

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
you have a Canon crop body you might not
need<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> bend<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> stick<00:00:50.789> down<00:00:50.969> because

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
need a bend that stick down because

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
need a bend that stick down because
you'll<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> EFS<00:00:52.410> mount<00:00:52.489> but<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.610> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you'll have the EFS mount but if you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450 
you'll have the EFS mount but if you
have<00:00:53.940> an<00:00:54.149> older<00:00:54.899> Canon<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> doesn't<00:00:56.280> take

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have an older Canon that doesn't take

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.700 
have an older Canon that doesn't take
EFS<00:00:56.910> lenses<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> full-frame

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
EFS lenses or if you have a full-frame

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
EFS lenses or if you have a full-frame
then<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.010> might<00:00:59.190> need<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> bend<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> down<00:00:59.789> or

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
then you might need to bend it down or

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
then you might need to bend it down or
cut<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:00.960> also<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:01.920> you're<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.129> use<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
cut it off also if you're gonna use it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.429 
cut it off also if you're gonna use it
on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> mirrorless<00:01:03.420> camera<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> might<00:01:04.260> need

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
on the mirrorless camera you might need

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
on the mirrorless camera you might need
a<00:01:04.500> cut<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> pin<00:01:05.369> off<00:01:05.689> another<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.049> had

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
a cut that pin off another thing I had

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.890 
a cut that pin off another thing I had
to<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.700> there's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> little<00:01:08.970> lever<00:01:09.659> right

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to do is there's a little lever right

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.480 
to do is there's a little lever right
here<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.590> locks<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> lens<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
here that actually locks the lens the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
here that actually locks the lens the
place<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> had<00:01:12.720> wasn't<00:01:13.020> long<00:01:13.140> enough

an<00:03:06.200> older<00:03:06.530> version<00:03:06.680> that's<00:03:07.040> an<00:03:07.250> M<00:03:07.520> 42<00:03:07.880> mm<00:03:08.920> but

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
an older version that's an M 42 mm but

an older version that's an M 42 mm but
this<00:03:10.460> one<00:03:10.610> isn't<00:03:10.700> Pentax<00:03:11.210> K<00:03:11.480> which<00:03:11.720> outfit<00:03:12.200> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
this one isn't Pentax K which outfit I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.320 
this one isn't Pentax K which outfit I
think<00:03:13.250> every<00:03:13.460> single<00:03:13.850> Pentax<00:03:14.450> camera<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.790> new

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
think every single Pentax camera the new

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.680 
think every single Pentax camera the new
ones<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.840> takes<00:03:18.020> like<00:03:18.170> every<00:03:18.650> came<00:03:19.550> out<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.630> you

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
me not a lot of people care about it but

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.420 
me not a lot of people care about it but
it's<00:03:52.489> built<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:53.000> good<00:03:54.280> look<00:03:55.280> at<00:03:55.370> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
it's built really good look at the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.770 
it's built really good look at the
coating<00:03:55.730> like<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.000> said<00:03:56.150> is<00:03:56.239> really<00:03:56.270> nice

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
coating like I said is really nice

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.860 
coating like I said is really nice
okay<00:03:57.709> that's<00:03:58.130> pretty<00:03:58.310> much<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.670> if<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.690> need<00:03:59.840> a

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
okay that's pretty much it if you need a

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.780 
okay that's pretty much it if you need a
20<00:04:00.500> millimeter<00:04:00.770> I<00:04:00.980> recommend<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.550> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
20 millimeter I recommend that the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.729 
20 millimeter I recommend that the
distortion<00:04:02.180> there's<00:04:02.989> really<00:04:03.140> not<00:04:03.380> any

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
distortion there's really not any

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.070 
distortion there's really not any

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080

it<00:04:08.810> on<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.050> crop<00:04:09.290> buddy<00:04:09.620> haven't<00:04:10.370> tried<00:04:10.519> on<00:04:10.670> a

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
it on the crop buddy haven't tried on a

it on the crop buddy haven't tried on a
full<00:04:10.940> frame<00:04:11.090> yet<00:04:11.360> but<00:04:12.019> when<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.170> do<00:04:12.290> I'll<00:04:12.620> make<00:04:12.800> a

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
full frame yet but when I do I'll make a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.550 
full frame yet but when I do I'll make a
better<00:04:13.790> video<00:04:13.970> for<00:04:14.269> them<00:04:14.390> but<00:04:15.230> if<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:15.410> need

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
better video for them but if you need

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.259 
better video for them but if you need
out<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.800> 20<00:04:16.070> millimeter<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:16.760> don't<00:04:17.060> mind

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
out to 20 millimeter and you don't mind

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.630 
out to 20 millimeter and you don't mind
manual<00:04:17.540> focus<00:04:17.900> I'd<00:04:18.109> recommend<00:04:18.710> a<00:04:18.830> you<00:04:19.460> could

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
manual focus I'd recommend a you could

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.729 
manual focus I'd recommend a you could
probably<00:04:20.150> find<00:04:20.390> them<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.630> ebay<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.930> just<00:04:21.200> try<00:04:21.680> to

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
probably find them on ebay I just try to

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.030 
probably find them on ebay I just try to
spend<00:04:21.979> under<00:04:22.130> $20<00:04:22.729> where

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
spend under $20 where

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.980 
spend under $20 where
because<00:04:23.970> once<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.600> go<00:04:24.690> over<00:04:24.720> terminology

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
because once you go over terminology

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.170 
because once you go over terminology
there's<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.890> lot<00:04:26.100> better<00:04:26.580> options<00:04:26.880> out<00:04:27.000> there

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
there's a lot better options out there

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670
