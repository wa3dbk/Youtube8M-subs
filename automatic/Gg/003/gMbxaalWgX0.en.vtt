00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.259
 not so for this first video is going 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.540
 introduce you to the kyo cage so 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.309
 my chila field this cage has been 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.429
 made exclusively not my big 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.270
 father and me in what effect two meters 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.390
 high and 84 cm wide 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.820
 so this cage nor one available in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.680
 store of course so for all 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 people who make their own 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 cash like me there are some rules to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.160
 abide by an act of donation byas already 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.640
 yal there is the type of wood you can 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.610
 use 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 it is better to prefer wine cages and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000
 bread because he did not speak a beautiful 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.020
 toxic 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 so that's why to help you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.420
 I will put the list of wood 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.070
 poisonous helping toxic at the end of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.270
 this video 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.309
 then you better choose 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.020
 the cages in length than in width 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.539
 it's just your sense he needs 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.399
 to jump so avoid rabbit cages 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.710
 so first of all I introduced you to the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 first piece a world that is rather 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 dedicated to the corner of doha so be able to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 a mac then not all shebab before 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.120
 match simply because they can 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.650
 eat so from the first day really 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 check if your meaning there the mans play 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 not to vassy le mans I'm worth better 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.820
 so take it off me the world liked it 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.220
 play on and gold so these are these 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 stays and forced wolf cid do it's 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.650
 a weird plant here is the ofas a little 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.659
 bird's nest boat so that's getting 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.299
 teeth on them then 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.909
 wooden houses 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.259
 so here is a corner house next in 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.570
 high you have a toy so there it is 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 me who make them and so then 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.159
 it's a bird pulls so that's a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 hazel boatman next here you 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.119
 have hooks that I hung here 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.350
 and I just did it 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.479
 suddenly they called time yet 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.450
 orange but in any case they love 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.950
 the ti bird is the only one 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.990
 so here is a new toy 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.939
 manufactured by month so I come from the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 do not have a moment that I do not 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.649
 will know his bedding so I use some 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.350
 hemp that indicates r I will clean the 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.369
 litter is all clean 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.189
 behind you have a mud both a 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.920
 air tower at the bottom so with hay 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.920
 in so you have to know that low 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.599
 Hay is 75% of his diet 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 is low that he needs it like you 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.709
 know all like the rabbit and the rodent 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.239
 down she uses to use her flights to the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.519
 first piece so now we're going 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.519
 mount a year that this piece played this 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.989
 piece of a playground for him this 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.420
 piece are useful this day of singing 20 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.069
 bridges then the bridges if they are 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.690
 important 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.099
 first of all because it amused him and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.510
 then because he makes his teeth 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.140
 over a year that mine he removed the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.060
 Corsican here turn here means then he 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.069
 better to buy in-store than 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.049
 do it yourself it is always the same 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.459
 toxic and non-toxic wood 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.799
 I was suspended with that then 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.440
 then here you have oil there is 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.940
 elected Tonka hazel and that trades 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.350
 so you have to put some person 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.910
 which your luck he has because he has 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.340
 need to teething so always 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.900
 a little port here and here you have a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.609
 toy made by month there's not a 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.760
 moment then so it's a hazel 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.590
 able our trails that is suspended 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600
 so I'm doing a disturbing but I put 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.579
 that's it, so you fight there takes the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.709
 tidy up so I just did 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.250
 which he never had this type of toy 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.450
 so no he will be able to test it 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.430
 so then in ten years a little bit 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.540
 unfairly the same piece so yes if you 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.139
 always have the same two play a 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.310
 blow if we suspended it like that 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.829
 sedunois outings too 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.950
 and if you have 17 wooden toys 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.200
 so this is a nonbred nest 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.180
 So I bought my wood 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.609
 pet shop so here it's hazel 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.109
 also and sissach workshop thoroughly then 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.680
 for all people who have a 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.180
 cage 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.189
 suitable for point racks like me 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.480
 like using this type of the workshop to 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.459
 bottom bottom simply because it is 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.650
 totally wood then do not cling 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.239
 at the roasting of your heart so me 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.859
 I like I would like you to be all there 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.170
 is finally he is very worried and very 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.150
 friendly so jean side you have 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.060
 as a toy but that's of the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.069
 ground so that's it is a wood on the ground 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.239
 so it's also ok for your 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.549
 meaning it simply because we 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.859
 buy it in neymar so here too 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.480
 you have the only one everywhere 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.180
 I put a little everywhere in his cage 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.130
 all the time so here's his piece I 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.650
 back a little bit here is his piece so 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.979
 quoting will go up one so here is the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.229
 dining corner in this corner eat down 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.810
 you first have these pellets 1 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.990
 who are here here it's gargoyles 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.580
 and especially schiller so I you 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.180
 would put the mark in a next 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.860
 video 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.400
 finally in the next section 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.990
 food then you have a stone 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.000
 in giant it is necessary to put a stone 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.229
 anger in your case without any fuss there 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.240
 because he's because he needs it 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.039
 they have to give in to him must really 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.449
 that they give it to him because it can be 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.919
 mortal for some the exchanged there are 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.680
 like redness and rabbits 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.889
 you really have to use your teeth and 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.000
 the co also 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.280
 here is a red stone to the recipe if 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.500
 she vegetable flavoring which killer he 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.479
 so always like but I like 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.889
 that here, however, it is he who 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.220
 brought her here because you have read neither 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.320
 down one consults his look the door then 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.570
 and if you have water so put in 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.430
 water disposition will make it better put 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.080
 glass bottles but I did not 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.030
 not found libourne goes for the blow there is 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.190
 a plastic baby bottle and here it 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.530
 was having fun biting the plastic here so 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.669
 it's not good for him so I 'll tell you 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.770
 really recommend glass baby bottles 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.229
 but I did not find any but I 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.300
 so find out then here you 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.220
 have a vegetable stand 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.409
 so I do not use vegetables well 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.690
 sure because the championship does not have a 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.180
 digestive tract adapted for so that 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.090
 never give vegetables or fruits 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.919
 or fresh food to your chinchilla 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.650
 really his food stops at 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.120
 points and to pellets so for more 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.469
 information of course about the next 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.930
 video about food 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:54.080
 he tries my next topic 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.180
 so it will be later that's the room 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.250
 food that is good it must be there 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.470
 to imitate ducroix eat must be that he 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.780
 understand this will decide the pursuit in 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.389
 so show here down here is the corner 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.949
 bathroom so that's a must years 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.720
 the one who purposely puts the 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.970
 know of bench inside for the 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.440
 look there so that's how it is 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.199
 I use bath sand 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.729
 extra-fine so I have a next 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.009
 heading I see if you give a 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.780
 trick for bread sand so that 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.630
 it's for later 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.669
 here is hemp so then up there 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.220
 also it's a corner reserved for 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.740
 toys is so here the bridge broke down 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.410
 so here is always the same bridge is 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.509
 always the same size 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.000
 so welcome to pascal master all 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.340
 first because he's going to have fun and then 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.370
 well it's going too am and tendons 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.289
 class sign it has received so they 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.009
 are hanging with saab in class and the 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.259
 wire 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.330
 so do not put lead wire 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.849
 one because it's toxic to them so 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.650
 simple wire we must do well 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.810
 because he can not hurt himself 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.720
 with his oracle at the end so you have to 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.159
 close it so here's a loan so here 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.139
 it's a ladder normally insured 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:05.060
 but I will turn into a rack to 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.590
 hay so normally your choices should 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.169
 to be below to eat the liver but 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.530
 he goes on so he goes straight to the 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.210
 source so after I imagine and it's this 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.389
 game in the face that he likes you have 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.740
 a ladder and a to a rope not getting 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.220
 leave that with the little wooden cube 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.720
 so they like it that often plays 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.310
 is down here it's a donkey shelf 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.970
 barley rather often and 6 1 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:32.570
 So here I am going to introduce myself 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.610
 this room so that of all at the top 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.080
 I prefer to tell myself that I had to take 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.360
 a stool one because I do not do any 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.380
 meters high 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:46.039
 it's really so much so it smells 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.479
 the hundred and 100 and so thank you all 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:50.120

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:53.380
