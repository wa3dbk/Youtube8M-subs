 a robber of the oceans 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.100
 they fascinate 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 fears and at the same time 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.600

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.120
 Arctic 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.370
 they are among the oldest inhabitants of the earth they existed before the

 understand 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.169
 are you better can they protect the animals
