00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.420 
position I know this dash cam mode isn't
the<00:01:55.890> most<00:01:56.040> practical<00:01:56.370> use<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.630> camera<00:01:57.960> phone

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the most practical use of a camera phone

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.859 
the most practical use of a camera phone
just<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.180> handle<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:00.750> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
just to see what I can handle when you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.229 
just to see what I can handle when you
push<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.650> its<00:02:01.680> limits<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.350> about

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
push it to its limits so I'm going about

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:25.280 
push it to its limits so I'm going about
40<00:02:09.239> miles<00:02:09.450> per<00:02:09.600> hour<00:02:23.600> hopefully<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.900> camera

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
40 miles per hour hopefully the camera

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:38.940 
40 miles per hour hopefully the camera
isn't<00:02:25.500> shaking<00:02:25.770> too<00:02:26.070> much

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150 

probably<00:02:39.950> give<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.220> another<00:02:41.500> 20<00:02:42.500> seconds<00:02:43.070> or

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
probably give it another 20 seconds or

00:02:43.160 --> 00:03:11.470 
probably give it another 20 seconds or
so<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.580> then<00:02:43.730> I'll<00:02:43.850> shut<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.120> off<00:03:10.390> all<00:03:11.390> right

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
so and then I'll shut it off all right

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.970 
so and then I'll shut it off all right
it<00:03:11.570> looks<00:03:11.690> like<00:03:11.840> we're<00:03:12.020> stopped<00:03:12.350> here<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.860> I'll

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
it looks like we're stopped here so I'll

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.820 
it looks like we're stopped here so I'll
probably<00:03:13.600> call<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.660> quits<00:03:14.990> here<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.650> was

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
probably call it quits here so this was

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.490 
probably call it quits here so this was
