00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.759
 Hi, I know when it rained in a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.120
 certain region may seem a bit 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.970
 abstract but then today we will learn to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.150
 measure the rain and understand the mystery of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.359
 millimeters is talking about weather forecast 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.939
 which we soon heard rained 50mm in 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.109
 one day the thunderstorm of yesterday accumulated 40 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.070
 in one hour the month closed with 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.770
 250 millimeters 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.840
 but what these millimeters mean is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.450
 very little rain 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.820
 this frequent doubt as used 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 to calculate the volume of rain is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.920
 millimeters per square meter 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.739
 imagine a square one meter by one is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.579
 now pour one liter of water into the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.500
 square 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.930
 the water will rise to the mark of 1 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.420
 mm in other words a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.460
 millimeter of rain equals one liter 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 of water per square meter 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.159
 It is easier to imagine that it rained 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.080
 40 millimeters would be 40 liters of water 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 in each square meter 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.140
 the rainy season is also very 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.570
 important 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 rain 40 liters of water during the day 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 can all have a smaller impact than 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.320
 raining 40 liters of water at a time 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.820
 in an hour what would be a true 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.159
 temporal 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.580
 and how do you measure rainfall in a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.320
 great metropolis are the rain gauges 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 scattered throughout the city ​​and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.509
 will indicate when it rained so 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.579
 just showing different values 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.890
 example the amount of rain that fell 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.439
 in a storm in the south can be 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.420
 different from the volume of rain that fell in 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.850
 same time in the death zone 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.280
 the instruments are within several 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.710
 official weather stations that will 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.540
 provide the data of Brazil as a whole 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.340
 an information network 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.130
 this data will enable the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.159
 comparisons of the amount of rain per 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.229
 day per month per year and up to the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.060
 weather forecast inmet in 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.150
 viewpoint of santana in the north zone of são 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.160
 paulo let's now know 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.920
 ana a rain gauge the word rain gauge 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.880
 It comes from Latin and means Meter 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.820
 Rain is this device here was marise e 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.220
 How does the rain gauge that compose 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.150
 and how rain is measured in the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.810
 day by day 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.660
 so the provi the subway we use 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.950
 of this cylinder it is collected in 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.700
 mm 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.950
 I opened this tap here the rain falls here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.230
 It 's a kind of funnel one shaped 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.959
 funnel opens this faucet and you go 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.959
 measure how much it has rained and this measurement is 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.690
 made in the morning at nine in the morning at three 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.830
 in the afternoon and at nine in the evening by 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.980
 observer 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.590
 Rain or shine, we're here. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.450
 watching the rain if a thunderstorm has 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.750
 night show at this time of the year. 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.330
 there is some other 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.490
 option to measure rainfall that is 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.190
 the automatic station 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.340
 it has sensors and also makes the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.360
 observation of the rain measuring in the station 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.190
 automatic 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.410
 right next door at the same time 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.600
 moment here in the viewpoint of santana a 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.470
 people are where the altitude more or 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.560
 less than 192 meters of altitude already have 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.280
 pre-established patterns you see that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.319
 is a free building site for which 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.330
 on one 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.150
 the passage of rain 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.970
 Now you can tell if it rained a lot 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.520
 depends on the amount of 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.520
 millimeters of the period in which the rain 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.650
 happened and of a third factor to 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.810
 historical average of the place 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.240
 here in brazil who does these measurements 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.500
 officially the National Institute of 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.340
 meteorology 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.800
 observations started there in 1910 is 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.940
 very important to know the average for 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.940
 to compare 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.709
 see example to make it easier 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.130
 the average rainfall in January in 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.470
 São Paulo is 236 millimeters 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.850
 not rainy weekend the city 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.890
 accumulated 118mm is enough rain 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.519
 is equivalent to half the historical average 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.380
 month 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.350
 on the other hand if the month of January 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.260
 ends with 50mm of rain is 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.030
 very little because it would be well below 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.370
 average for the period 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.380
