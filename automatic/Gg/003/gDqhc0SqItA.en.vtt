okay welcome to the first video in our
series<00:00:05.529> on<00:00:05.950> dissections<00:00:06.520> the<00:00:06.730> first<00:00:07.330> thing<00:00:07.509> I

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
series on dissections the first thing I

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:08.879 
series on dissections the first thing I
wanted<00:00:07.750> to<00:00:07.839> do<00:00:07.960> is<00:00:08.080> just<00:00:08.109> go<00:00:08.379> over<00:00:08.469> the<00:00:08.650> tools

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
wanted to do is just go over the tools

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.500 
wanted to do is just go over the tools
that<00:00:09.070> you'll<00:00:09.370> have<00:00:09.490> in<00:00:09.549> your<00:00:09.760> dissection<00:00:10.000> kit

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
that you'll have in your dissection kit

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.049 
that you'll have in your dissection kit
to<00:00:11.470> start<00:00:11.740> off<00:00:11.860> with<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.340> simplest<00:00:12.849> and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
to start off with the simplest and

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.990 
to start off with the simplest and
probably<00:00:13.660> most<00:00:14.019> useful<00:00:14.590> tool<00:00:14.769> you<00:00:15.400> have<00:00:15.429> your

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
probably most useful tool you have your

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.689 
probably most useful tool you have your
pair<00:00:16.270> of<00:00:16.420> fine<00:00:16.810> scissors<00:00:17.529> so<00:00:18.160> these<00:00:18.279> have<00:00:18.460> more

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
pair of fine scissors so these have more

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.390 
pair of fine scissors so these have more
of<00:00:18.789> a<00:00:18.850> point<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.390> they're<00:00:20.140> good<00:00:20.800> for<00:00:21.010> fine

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
of a point of they're good for fine

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.670 
of a point of they're good for fine
precision<00:00:21.939> cutting<00:00:22.300> you'll<00:00:23.080> actually<00:00:23.260> find

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
precision cutting you'll actually find

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.019 
precision cutting you'll actually find
that<00:00:23.830> these<00:00:24.010> are<00:00:24.189> much<00:00:24.340> more<00:00:24.550> helpful<00:00:25.000> than

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
that these are much more helpful than

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.880 
that these are much more helpful than
your<00:00:25.269> scalpel<00:00:25.779> for<00:00:26.260> most<00:00:26.439> of<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.650> cutting

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
your scalpel for most of the cutting

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.040 
your scalpel for most of the cutting
tasks<00:00:27.460> that<00:00:27.580> you'll<00:00:27.730> be<00:00:27.850> doing<00:00:28.029> when<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.810> comes

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
tasks that you'll be doing when it comes

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
to art our dissections in class these

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.140 
to art our dissections in class these
are<00:00:32.080> your<00:00:32.349> heavy<00:00:32.590> scissors<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.580> is<00:00:33.640> good<00:00:33.940> for

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
are your heavy scissors this is good for

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.790 
are your heavy scissors this is good for
cutting<00:00:34.300> through<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.719> outside<00:00:35.079> of<00:00:35.140> organisms

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
cutting through the outside of organisms

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.740 
cutting through the outside of organisms
for<00:00:36.219> example<00:00:36.250> this<00:00:37.059> will<00:00:37.210> be<00:00:37.329> very<00:00:37.540> helpful

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
for example this will be very helpful

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.540 
for example this will be very helpful
when<00:00:37.989> we're<00:00:38.140> doing<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.469> squid<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:39.010> cut

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
when we're doing the squid to cut

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.889 
when we're doing the squid to cut
through<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.820> outside<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.329> mantle<00:00:40.750> which

through the outside of the mantle which

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.930 
through the outside of the mantle which
is<00:00:41.050> kind<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.320> thick<00:00:41.590> these<00:00:42.370> are<00:00:42.550> good<00:00:42.730> for

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
is kind of thick these are good for

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.340 
is kind of thick these are good for
heavy<00:00:43.180> cutting<00:00:43.570> but<00:00:43.719> not<00:00:43.899> great<00:00:44.140> for

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
heavy cutting but not great for

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.680 
heavy cutting but not great for
precision<00:00:44.890> if<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.309> need<00:00:45.489> precision<00:00:45.850> go<00:00:46.540> with

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
precision if you need precision go with

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.619 
precision if you need precision go with
the<00:00:46.840> smaller<00:00:47.200> dissecting<00:00:47.920> scissors<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:49.329> of

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
the smaller dissecting scissors all of

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.100 
the smaller dissecting scissors all of
your<00:00:49.870> dissecting<00:00:50.770> kits<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.309> two<00:00:51.640> pairs<00:00:51.940> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
your dissecting kits have two pairs of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.080 
your dissecting kits have two pairs of
tweezers<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:54.250> of<00:00:54.370> them<00:00:54.460> will<00:00:54.550> be<00:00:54.670> curved

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
tweezers some of them will be curved

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.119 
tweezers some of them will be curved
others<00:00:55.480> will<00:00:55.600> be<00:00:55.719> straight<00:00:55.989> like<00:00:56.170> this<00:00:56.410> this

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
others will be straight like this this

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.069 
others will be straight like this this
is<00:00:57.340> helpful<00:00:57.640> because<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:58.570> have<00:00:58.840> multiple

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
is helpful because you can have multiple

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.470 
is helpful because you can have multiple
people<00:00:59.680> in<00:00:59.739> your<00:00:59.860> group<00:00:59.920> helping<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.670> as<00:01:00.850> long

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
people in your group helping you as long

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.689 
people in your group helping you as long
as<00:01:01.510> they<00:01:01.809> have<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.530> tweezers<00:01:03.160> you're<00:01:03.550> not

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
as they have the tweezers you're not

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.680 
as they have the tweezers you're not
really<00:01:03.820> going<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.089> get<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.300> each<00:01:04.390> other's<00:01:04.509> way

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
really going to get in each other's way

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.870 
really going to get in each other's way
this<00:01:05.410> is<00:01:05.530> also<00:01:05.680> very<00:01:05.979> helpful<00:01:06.190> if<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.610> need<00:01:06.760> to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
this is also very helpful if you need to

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.120 
this is also very helpful if you need to
maybe<00:01:07.060> hold<00:01:07.390> some<00:01:07.689> tissue<00:01:07.990> while<00:01:08.770> someone

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
maybe hold some tissue while someone

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.770 
maybe hold some tissue while someone
else<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:09.460> cutting<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:10.180> can<00:01:10.299> have<00:01:10.390> one<00:01:10.570> person

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
else is cutting you can have one person

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.600 
else is cutting you can have one person
hold<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.740> other<00:01:11.860> person<00:01:12.189> cut<00:01:12.369> with<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
hold and the other person cut with the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.250 
hold and the other person cut with the
scissors<00:01:12.760> you<00:01:13.420> should<00:01:13.630> never<00:01:13.810> have<00:01:13.960> your

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
scissors you should never have your

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.649 
scissors you should never have your
hands<00:01:14.860> near<00:01:15.400> anything<00:01:15.790> that's<00:01:16.000> being<00:01:16.210> used<00:01:16.479> to

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
hands near anything that's being used to

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.240 
hands near anything that's being used to
cut<00:01:16.840> with<00:01:17.020> whether<00:01:17.260> they<00:01:17.409> be<00:01:17.470> scissors<00:01:17.950> or<00:01:18.159> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
cut with whether they be scissors or the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.580 
cut with whether they be scissors or the
scalpel<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:18.880> always<00:01:19.540> use<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:19.930> tweezers<00:01:20.380> to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
scalpel you always use the tweezers to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.800 
scalpel you always use the tweezers to
hold<00:01:20.950> things<00:01:21.159> that's<00:01:21.790> why<00:01:22.030> each<00:01:22.240> kit<00:01:22.600> will

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
hold things that's why each kit will

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.330 
hold things that's why each kit will
have<00:01:22.960> two<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.920> way<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.100> can<00:01:24.189> have

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
have two so that way you can have

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.330 
have two so that way you can have
multiple<00:01:24.520> people<00:01:24.909> using<00:01:25.210> them<00:01:25.479> at<00:01:25.600> once<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
multiple people using them at once the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.240 
multiple people using them at once the
probe<00:01:27.909> isn't<00:01:28.540> helpful<00:01:29.350> for<00:01:29.650> too<00:01:29.830> many<00:01:30.009> things

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
probe isn't helpful for too many things

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.730 
probe isn't helpful for too many things
other<00:01:30.400> than<00:01:30.610> for<00:01:31.090> pointing<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.290> parts<00:01:32.590> if<00:01:32.710> you

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
other than for pointing to parts if you

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.859 
other than for pointing to parts if you
need<00:01:32.979> precision<00:01:33.579> when<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.180> comes<00:01:34.329> to<00:01:34.509> pointing

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
need precision when it comes to pointing

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.899 
need precision when it comes to pointing
to<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.049> certain<00:01:35.380> area<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:36.159> can<00:01:36.340> certainly<00:01:36.520> use

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
to a certain area you can certainly use

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.830 
to a certain area you can certainly use
this<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:38.110> curved<00:01:38.380> probe<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:39.040> also<00:01:39.820> good<00:01:40.600> for

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
this the curved probe is also good for

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.649 
this the curved probe is also good for
pointing<00:01:41.229> at<00:01:41.320> things<00:01:41.850> sometimes<00:01:42.850> it's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
pointing at things sometimes it's

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
of these in your dissection

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.460 
of these in your dissection
kit<00:02:10.580> until<00:02:10.970> our<00:02:11.299> last<00:02:11.540> dissection<00:02:12.230> when<00:02:12.379> we

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
kit until our last dissection when we

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.070 
kit until our last dissection when we
get<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.799> rat<00:02:12.980> these<00:02:13.819> are<00:02:14.150> extremely<00:02:14.750> sharp

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
get to the rat these are extremely sharp

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.899 
get to the rat these are extremely sharp
as<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.709> can<00:02:15.860> probably<00:02:16.069> see<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.640> video

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
as you can probably see in the video

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.880 
as you can probably see in the video
here<00:02:17.209> they<00:02:17.629> have<00:02:17.750> replaceable<00:02:18.110> blades

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
here they have replaceable blades

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.559 
here they have replaceable blades
so<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.459> each<00:02:19.580> dissection<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:20.420> get<00:02:20.540> a

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
so for each dissection you get a

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.270 
so for each dissection you get a
brand-new<00:02:21.019> blade<00:02:21.349> placed<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.890> there

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
brand-new blade placed on there

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.570 
brand-new blade placed on there
these<00:02:22.700> things<00:02:23.030> are<00:02:23.290> tremendously<00:02:24.290> sharp<00:02:24.680> just

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
these things are tremendously sharp just

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.680 
these things are tremendously sharp just

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
very much most of the dissections we'll

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.930 
very much most of the dissections we'll
be<00:03:00.109> doing<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.799> get<00:03:00.980> away<00:03:01.099> with<00:03:01.430> using<00:03:01.459> the

be doing you can get away with using the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.729 
be doing you can get away with using the
scissors<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.450> these<00:03:03.049> are<00:03:03.200> actually<00:03:03.560> much

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
scissors and these are actually much

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.520 
scissors and these are actually much
more<00:03:03.980> precise<00:03:04.579> for<00:03:04.909> most<00:03:05.120> cuttings<00:03:05.540> but<00:03:05.750> for

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
more precise for most cuttings but for

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.289 
more precise for most cuttings but for
certain<00:03:06.829> steps<00:03:07.069> in<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.310> rat<00:03:07.489> dissection<00:03:08.090> you

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
certain steps in the rat dissection you

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.080 
certain steps in the rat dissection you
will<00:03:08.629> need<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.079> use<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.409> scalpel<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.640> this

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
will need to use the scalpel so this

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.550 
will need to use the scalpel so this
again<00:03:11.359> will<00:03:11.569> only<00:03:11.720> show<00:03:11.989> up<00:03:12.109> in<00:03:12.290> your

again will only show up in your

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.890 
again will only show up in your
dissection<00:03:12.890> kits<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.519> last<00:03:13.909> one<00:03:14.269> but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
dissection kits for the last one but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.390 
dissection kits for the last one but
it's<00:03:14.930> something<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.530> absolutely<00:03:15.709> have<00:03:16.370> to

just<00:04:13.129> as<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.370> found<00:04:13.609> it

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
just as you found it

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.120 
just as you found it
often<00:04:14.840> times<00:04:15.049> I<00:04:15.260> suggest<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:15.829> leave<00:04:15.919> them

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
often times I suggest you leave them

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.759 
often times I suggest you leave them
open<00:04:16.489> on<00:04:16.609> my<00:04:16.849> desk<00:04:17.090> because<00:04:17.750> after<00:04:18.560> you're

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
open on my desk because after you're

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.680 
open on my desk because after you're
done<00:04:19.010> using<00:04:19.459> this<00:04:19.579> you'll<00:04:19.820> rinse<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.269> off<00:04:20.419> and

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
done using this you'll rinse it off and

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.839 
done using this you'll rinse it off and
if<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.380> leave<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.709> closed<00:04:22.039> up<00:04:22.219> the<00:04:22.400> materials

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
if you leave it closed up the materials

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:23.950 
if you leave it closed up the materials
never<00:04:23.030> dry

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
never dry

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.629 
never dry

the<00:04:25.729> next<00:04:25.940> lap<00:04:26.090> group<00:04:26.330> will<00:04:26.449> come<00:04:26.569> along<00:04:26.840> and

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
the next lap group will come along and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.110 
the next lap group will come along and
make<00:04:27.680> sure<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.100> all<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.550> materials<00:04:29.000> are

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
make sure that all the materials are

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.580 
make sure that all the materials are
there<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.479> also<00:04:29.630> helpful<00:04:29.960> for<00:04:30.080> me<00:04:30.350> if<00:04:30.470> you

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
there it's also helpful for me if you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.320 
there it's also helpful for me if you
leave<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.860> open<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.639> check<00:04:31.850> these<00:04:32.030> thin

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
leave it open I have to check these thin

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.450 
leave it open I have to check these thin
to<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.479> lab<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.900> make<00:04:33.050> sure<00:04:33.199> everything<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.280> in

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
to the lab to make sure everything is in

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.640 
to the lab to make sure everything is in
place<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.660> just<00:04:35.870> much<00:04:36.020> easier<00:04:36.080> for<00:04:36.560> me

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
place and it's just much easier for me

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.800 
place and it's just much easier for me
to<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:37.099> when<00:04:37.400> they're<00:04:37.520> left<00:04:37.699> open<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.690> as

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
to do that when they're left open so as

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.059 
to do that when they're left open so as
long<00:04:38.960> as<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.169> respect<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.620> tools<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:39.979> are

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
long as you respect the tools that are

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.469 
long as you respect the tools that are
in<00:04:40.250> here<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.789> should<00:04:40.940> be<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.210> fine

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
in here you should be just fine

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.240 
in here you should be just fine
the<00:04:41.810> dissection<00:04:42.289> guides<00:04:42.740> will<00:04:42.919> tell<00:04:43.130> you

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
the dissection guides will tell you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.189 
the dissection guides will tell you
which<00:04:43.430> tool<00:04:43.699> to<00:04:43.729> use<00:04:43.849> for<00:04:44.150> which<00:04:44.300> step<00:04:44.569> so<00:04:45.139> it

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
which tool to use for which step so it

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.540 
which tool to use for which step so it
should<00:04:45.319> be<00:04:45.349> no<00:04:45.560> guessing<00:04:45.979> when<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.220> comes<00:04:46.370> to

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
should be no guessing when it comes to

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.760 
should be no guessing when it comes to
that<00:04:46.720> make<00:04:47.720> sure<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:47.990> answer<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.380> questions
