00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.220
 for those who do not know this is the 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.480
 Fat's office 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.840
 there's a mac there work here 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.449
 two mac minis I do some tests 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.089
 but what we will use is this dell 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.800
 There you are running windows because 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:25.009
 I tried to do this procedure some 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.220
 virtualized times both compare them with 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.159
 with the old man it never works 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.780
 always some kind of then if you just 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:37.670
 I have mex there and I recommend that you are a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.559
 sack smear on some colleague in the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.800
 because the procedure is quick 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.500
 But it 's safer for you to do this. 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.949
 using a windows machine 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.949
 I have here you know that you will use 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.269
 he is without a rude way and we're going 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.089
 do 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.140
 first we will download everything we 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.840
 need to unlock him to do the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.830
 unlock the boutique with and make a 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.480
 root mode 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.460
 in another video so you do not get too much 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.860
 because I already wrote the text the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.660
 procedure is very large and I go 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.520
 then divide into two parts 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.860
 first video i will show the unlock 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.540
 and the rough way and then how to install the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.340
 surgeon death 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.890
 to start you will have to do the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.750
 the cable without the cable if you 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.130
 connected cable will give and you have to 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.690
 I came here in the settings scroll in this 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.380
 menu here until the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.620
 developer and branding decoration with usb 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.530
 on some models this is already active 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:58.190
 so if you're already active you let him 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:02.120
 back there, do it good, and turn it off on your 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.480
 computer you can already run the odin 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.770
 which is the program that will use 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.690
 Now you're going to do the following knots. 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.129
 Let's put it in a calling thing. 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.620
 download world 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.510
 so you will press the same time 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.450
 power button than the volume 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.519
 down it will appear this screen 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.799
 here you give a touch 15 in volume to 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.640
 Up to confirm 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:29.150
 done this you will connect usb cable 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.810
 what is on the computer here that goes 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.810
 to happen 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.190
 you will notice that this is when 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.140
 I'll shoot the cable. 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 I'm going to take the car out of it again. 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.040
 disappears when I connect and it stays here. 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.019
 blue whiting is the indication he got 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.659
 find the device it is 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.659
 ready to do the procedure 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.750
 so on the pills you downloaded 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.200
 will click here PDA that will catch this 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.180
 rich came here 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.049
 it will give start it will make a 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:10.340
 very fast procedure here or sending 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.819
 there you will restart the tab in this 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.510
 You can already disconnect the cables. 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.699
 he will start when he finally 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.569
 initial we will do to people 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:26.090
 will catch will go off again will 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.709
 enter another mode and install the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.699
 files you have played inside SD 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.470
 as it is written in the text and 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.500
 got thrown 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.389
 It's three kilos one is what we 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.160
 will do a root mode 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:50.299
 the other is what we are going to put the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.819
 cyanogen and finally the complement 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.699
 that have the mapuches gmail the things of the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.449
 Google that does not enter the luciano 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:02.709
 legal problems started then people 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:05.959
 will hang up holding power here 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:10.310
 Turn it off and we'll put it now. 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.930
 in a mode called template recovery that does not 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.930
 It is to download another agent came 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.570
 now download today was paulo but 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 low volume now I have not seen as mold 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.849
 We'll get in here on power technique. 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.159
 up 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.620
 He's going to shake you already know. 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:30.410
 that he 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.410
 interpreted that it is in the correct mode 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.139
 here o 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.440
 He already has the ball, so he 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.930
 properly changed flash to do with the 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.330
 staff usually call it is running 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.600
 a version here that the old one that is the 5 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.250
 504 but for now it will work 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.360
 another video when we went to install 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.860
 Ocean 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.690
 Then I'll explain how we 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.180
 change this with a newer version 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.160
 Why will you need to try to install 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.919
 now it will give an error 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.330
 so come on we'll use the 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.979
 techniques of a man up and down 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:12.570
 Down to get around here - you go. 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.550
 enter zipfel install sd card goes 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.120
 choose the first option here 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.370
 schulze be was the sd card will enter the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.070
 part you put the file I created 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.639
 a folder called rex to organize 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:31.169
 better and will choose this one and O cw 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.300
 useful track so the getafe and 2.11 pi and 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.970
 Then you'll go down to this one. 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.410
 confirming then look is making a 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.729
 procedure very quickly that he already 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.639
 made the module ti 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.010
 So we'll come in here and give a 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.889
 rebound 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.050
 When I start, I'll get a 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:56.430
 program that as it is in the text 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.820
 of the post is for you to have downloaded that is 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.949

 backup your rom if you want 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.530
 to backup samsung rotation 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.139
 before putting the ocean in case you 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.660
 Wanna go back then you can do this? 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.039
 and you can install multiple accounts 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.039
 also to play 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.300
 as you are feeling more 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:24.930
 will in this world from jack to android 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.340
 so I'll wait here for him to start 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:34.979
 you did not download 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:37.010
 download you will go in there in the store will 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:44.270
 put here 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:44.270
 with a boy and he will already suggest 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:07:00.210
 My good boy, what if he cooks? 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.280

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.090
 Are you going to install then go? 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.060
 stay the same 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.490

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.950
 You go in and he'll give you a warning. 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.890
 talking that he can not perform because 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.790
 do not have a root mode here as it has a 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.250
 module ti then it is inter normal this 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:27.930
 warns that he is giving is a wrote 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:30.180
 talking to using this application with 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:34.020
 moderation because you can do 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.330
 bullshit with him so be careful about that 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.310
 We already know that he has a 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.640
 rotary engine I'm going to give another program 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:46.380
 which requires mode so that the team has a 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:52.850
 decap appeared the rapper asking

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.070
 post a little bit 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:18.380
 the second video showing there as 

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.380
