 vincent carbou the battery teacher 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.620
 of guitar to experience it only to a small 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.620
 course on jazz 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 we will start with counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.439
 1 2 3 4 5 6 to play on the ride with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.970
 our right and the wand 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.330
 Charleston left foot out of tune 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.960
 the famous chabada such holding of a 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.370
 such area which is the basis of jazz this 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 on the 1 a ride 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.930
 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 on leucate a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.560
 ride with a hi-hat on the left foot 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.050
 finally on the 6 a ride 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.050
 3 5 6 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.390
 there we will add some frills 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.640
 with our bass drum and our hand 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.990
 left on the clear box obviously he 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.740
 there are so many combinations you want I 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.110
 am just going to give you a few 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.960
 kivu basics care is useful on 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 starts with a helping hand from 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:46.310
 preferably a knox cave on the 3 1 2 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:48.439
 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 then we do not 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.299
 only the snare on the 3 but 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:02:03.469
 also a box class on the 6 so in 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:02:04.399
 same time as the rai I specify that the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.780
 motives that I am trying to 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.670
 give are not supposed to groove and 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.420
 especially it is especially for you 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.220
 do different work 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.569
 combinations that you will then advance 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:24.010
 according to your good globe then big 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:24.010
 case on 3 and 6 1 2 3 4 6 1 2 3 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.599
 insatiable we will then combined the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.569
 bass drum and snare drum headphones 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.569
 laugh on three bass drums on 6 1/2 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:09.180
 bass drum areas on three crates 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:12.450
 4 6 1 2 3 6 1 2 3 1 then a little 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.500
 clear gas pattern well fed with the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:27.080
 case what ensures the 1 on the 3 and on the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:30.860
 six of those two hits in a row on the 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.860
 which are not easy to do 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.310
 as much when you're right-handed with 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.629
 your right hand is easy enough 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.950
 to chain a lot but as much with 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.400
 your left hand at the same time as the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.780
 right hand 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.920
 these people we chained with a pattern 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.840
 particularly complicated still for 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.470
 the left hand with a helmet 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 air on two and three and on 5 and 6 1 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:24.510
 2 5 if you are really eggs of 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.860
 games in the strolls you accentuate to 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.389
 every time the second 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:44.970
 so the left hand that is 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:47.580
 find on the 3 and on the six I you 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.740
 then gives the finish two breaks of 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.010
 small filling patterns 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.159
 the first is simply to do 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:01.940
 a helping hand right on the one-shot 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.940
 left hand on the 3-2 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:16.410
 the goal is because it's not 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:18.810
 binary 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 in 2 3 and if 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.670
 we put that on the pattern in 6 with your 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:43.620
 Charleston on the case that makes us 1 2 3 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:47.180
 6 2 you can do that once 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.180
 that hope once on the tables 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:01.650
 Friendly last turn / 6/1 and 2 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.210
 did a ghost notes with your hand 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.680
 right have made a big note a 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.830
 new tournament why not a new one 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.130
 serious a ticket to rhinestone so 1,2 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:17.580
 on the three have made an accent with the 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:19.980
 left hand and the same thing on 4 5 6 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.140
 only we beat anderson who comes 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:32.940
 graft to the left foot on the case 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:34.500
 so 1,2 would never attend enough on the 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.340
 nuance must be brought between the ghosts 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.340
 of and the accent 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.060
 we believe
