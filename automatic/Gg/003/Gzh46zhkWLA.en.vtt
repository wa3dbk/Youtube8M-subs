00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.219
 show how a french toast is done 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.480
 relatively easy and also very rich 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.789
 Here I have already put an egg and a half cup 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.800
 of milk 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.700
 Now what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.870
 add ground cinnamon 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:30.810
 a little 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:32.880
 and I'm going to beat it the first time 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.060
 I saw this made me a bit like bed 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 I was going to like it because as it carries the egg 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.700
 and soaked in the flour , I was made 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.880
 pretty weird but it's really 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 pretty pretty rich and how are we going to 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.970
 cook in the pan because it is going to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.890
 finish cooking very well then already 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.909
 we mix this 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.909
 now we go to the pan 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.820
 good since they put to heat their 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.610
 This pan is more or less warm you 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.610
 I'm going to add butter a little 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.800
 do not forget to mention that this dish 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.720
 how children love to be 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.560
 And they can do it in less than 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.210
 three minutes 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.500
 so they have all the ingredients 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.190
 that are very common I will let you 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 warm a little more 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.930
 Y 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.420
 and here I have the mixture of milk and everything 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.159
 that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.159
 and I have the bread 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.140
 [Music] 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.270
 Y 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.240
 I'm waiting for it to warm up a little 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.659
 more and what they are going to do can take 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.110
 white bread if they want but I'm going to 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.710
 use wholemeal bread 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.740
 they are going to soak bread 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.700
 in the mix I will remove the excess and 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 they are going to put it there 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.960
 this is going to give you approximately 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.960
 about 4 to 5 slices of bread 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.370
 to let it take a moment for 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.370
 down 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.890
 since they saw that I have to be 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.110
 seeing now well below are more 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.200
 little gold what else I saw how I was going to 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.200
 stay 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.480
 and it is 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.230
 and I do not want to upload many successes of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.230
 this year 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.510
 and if you like to make them more 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.530
 rich with more than butter to it 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.530
 brown prettier 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.289
 apart 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.289
 [Music] 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.370
 and they're just going to ride us two 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.100
 sides while they have been well 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.930
 golden on one side and the other is not going to 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.209
 need to be turning it around so much 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.209
 but if they feel they have a little left 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.890
 [Music] 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.340
 pale on one side we can only see 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.340
 hit 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.050
 Well, here I already have my frames 2 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.480
 you can eat it with jam 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.670
 milk or honey or maple syrup 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.920
 I only thing I have right now is honey 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.880
 maple but I'm just going to put one 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.880
 small amount 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.389
 and they can accompany it with what you 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.389
 want is that I made myself 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.320
 smoothie 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.409
 strawberry with lots of fruit 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.929
 to accompany you 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:46.089
 but you can never eat if you want to 

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:48.099
 an atole with a coffee tea actually 

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:51.879
 same if you want you can put 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.879
 fruit over this dish is also 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.489
 very versatile and also very very rich very 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:02.349
 easy to prepare leave me your 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:06.599
 comments to see if they liked it or not and 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.599
 see you until the next video
