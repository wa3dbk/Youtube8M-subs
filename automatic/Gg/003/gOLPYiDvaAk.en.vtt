00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
hi and welcome to another tip in this

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.349 
hi and welcome to another tip in this
tip<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.190> look<00:00:05.339> at<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.549> setting<00:00:06.180> for

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
tip we're going to look at a setting for

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.610 
tip we're going to look at a setting for
lights<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.140> cinema<00:00:07.500> 4d<00:00:07.580> called<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.880> clipping

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
lights in cinema 4d called a clipping

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.009 
lights in cinema 4d called a clipping
there<00:00:10.620> are<00:00:10.950> two<00:00:11.160> settings<00:00:11.550> near<00:00:12.210> clip<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.719> far

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
there are two settings near clip and far

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.870 
there are two settings near clip and far
clip<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> show<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.700> an

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
clip and I'm just going to show you an

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.490 
clip and I'm just going to show you an
example<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.450> how<00:00:15.509> I've<00:00:15.780> used<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
example of how I've used this in the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.250 
example of how I've used this in the
past<00:00:16.680> now<00:00:17.670> before<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> start<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.630> want<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
past now before I start I just want to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
past now before I start I just want to
say<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.710> there<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.010> other<00:00:20.310> ways<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> work

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
say that there are other ways to work

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
say that there are other ways to work
around<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.320> example<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.100> i'm<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
around this example that i'm going to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
around this example that i'm going to
show<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.350> really<00:00:25.350> only<00:00:25.680> showing<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
show and really only showing this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.630 
show and really only showing this
example<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.930> only<00:00:28.310> simple<00:00:29.310> way

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
example because it's the only simple way

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
example because it's the only simple way
that<00:00:29.880> i<00:00:29.910> could<00:00:30.029> come<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> describe

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that i could come up with to describe

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
that i could come up with to describe
what<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> feature<00:00:32.160> does<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.329> i'm<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.570> trying

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
what the feature does so i'm not trying

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.720 
what the feature does so i'm not trying
to<00:00:33.930> say<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.469> best<00:00:34.620> way<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> solve

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to say this is the best way to solve

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
to say this is the best way to solve
this<00:00:35.910> problem<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.079> trying<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> say<00:00:37.559> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this problem I'm just trying to say that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
this problem I'm just trying to say that
this<00:00:37.890> feature<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.760> used<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.480> solve<00:00:39.660> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
this feature can be used to solve this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.270 
this feature can be used to solve this
problem<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.100> let's<00:00:41.309> jump<00:00:41.520> right<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:43.040> I've<00:00:44.040> got

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
problem so let's jump right in I've got

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.490 
problem so let's jump right in I've got
a<00:00:44.309> scene<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.570> light<00:00:46.309> at<00:00:47.309> cube<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
a scene here with a light at cube and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.490 
a scene here with a light at cube and
sort<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> light<00:00:50.730> fixture<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
sort of a light fixture up here with a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.330 
sort of a light fixture up here with a
bulb<00:00:52.770> inside<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> practical

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
bulb inside of it so in the practical

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.459 
bulb inside of it so in the practical
example<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.180> could<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> translucent

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
example this could be a translucent

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.000 
example this could be a translucent
light<00:00:58.680> shade<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.960> maybe<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.230> want<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.710> light

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
light shade and maybe we want this light

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.609 
light shade and maybe we want this light
to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.370> coming<00:01:02.699> from<00:01:02.730> inside<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
to be coming from inside of it so the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
to be coming from inside of it so the
first<00:01:04.860> thing<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.159> would<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.580> place<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
first thing we would do is place this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.940 
first thing we would do is place this
light<00:01:07.460> inside<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:10.770> my

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
light inside so I would just go from my

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.880 
light inside so I would just go from my
side<00:01:11.369> view<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.060> front<00:01:12.330> view<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.710> make

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
side view on my front view and just make

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.190 
side view on my front view and just make
sure<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.490> light<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.150> placed<00:01:15.600> inside<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
sure that the light is placed inside of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
sure that the light is placed inside of
the<00:01:16.290> bulb<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the bulb because that's where we want to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
the bulb because that's where we want to
like<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> come<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.280> adjust

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
like to come from and then I can adjust

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.420 
like to come from and then I can adjust
the<00:01:20.909> fall<00:01:21.210> off<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.890> illuminate

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the fall off to see it illuminate

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.350 
the fall off to see it illuminate
everything<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.750> render<00:01:25.970> we<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.150> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
everything and if I render we see that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.380 
everything and if I render we see that
we<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.720> our<00:01:27.869> scene<00:01:28.259> being<00:01:28.650> lit<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
we get our scene being lit up but the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.100 
we get our scene being lit up but the
immediate<00:01:30.750> problem<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> encounter<00:01:32.100> is

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
immediate problem that I encounter is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.929 
immediate problem that I encounter is
there's<00:01:34.110> no<00:01:34.290> shadow<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.369> seeing<00:01:35.610> some

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
there's no shadow so we're seeing some

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.289 
there's no shadow so we're seeing some
light<00:01:35.970> leakage<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.640> looks

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
light leakage here and it just looks

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.560 
light leakage here and it just looks
really<00:01:39.570> unrealistic<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
really unrealistic so what we can do is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.039 
really unrealistic so what we can do is
add<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> shadow<00:01:43.259> let's<00:01:44.070> use<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> soft<00:01:44.909> shadow<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
add a shadow let's use a soft shadow and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.770 
add a shadow let's use a soft shadow and
when<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.560> render<00:01:47.180> everything's<00:01:48.180> black<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
when we render everything's black all of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.080 
when we render everything's black all of
a<00:01:48.810> sudden<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.640> spot

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
a sudden and we just have this one spot

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.109 
a sudden and we just have this one spot
here<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.750> some<00:01:52.280> maybe<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.700> hole<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
here from some maybe from a hole in the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.980 
here from some maybe from a hole in the
geometry<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:57.180> reason<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
geometry and the reason for that is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.130 
geometry and the reason for that is
because<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.790> actual<00:01:59.790> geometry<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.630> blocking

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because the actual geometry is blocking

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
because the actual geometry is blocking
our<00:02:01.259> light<00:02:01.469> from<00:02:01.740> coming<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.210> now<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
our light from coming up now one of the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
our light from coming up now one of the
ways<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.229> around<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
ways we can get around that is with the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.270 
ways we can get around that is with the
clipping<00:02:05.759> option<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.409> only<00:02:07.680> works<00:02:07.979> if

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
clipping option but this only works if

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.219 
clipping option but this only works if
it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.550> spotlight<00:02:09.030> at<00:02:09.720> least<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> my

it's a spotlight at least in my

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
it's a spotlight at least in my
experiments<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.670> I'm<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.970> change<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
experiments so I'm going to change to a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
experiments so I'm going to change to a
spotlight

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770

rotate it into place and then sort of
widen<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.740> beam<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.820> fits<00:02:18.570> our<00:02:18.870> light

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050

Oh turning shadows off a render again

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.790 
Oh turning shadows off a render again
now<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.510> we've<00:02:27.630> made<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.020> spotlight<00:02:28.530> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
now that we've made it a spotlight it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.290 
now that we've made it a spotlight it
should<00:02:29.010> look<00:02:29.160> pretty<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.790> same<00:02:30.000> as<00:02:30.180> it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
should look pretty much the same as it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.650 
should look pretty much the same as it
did<00:02:30.450> before<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.090> time<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.510> has<00:02:33.630> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
did before but this time it has a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.450 
did before but this time it has a
spotlight<00:02:34.170> profile<00:02:35.450> now<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.680> turn<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
spotlight profile now we can turn the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.020 
spotlight profile now we can turn the
shadow<00:02:38.700> back<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.190> we<00:02:41.190> see<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.430> problem

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
shadow back on and we see that problem

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.260 
shadow back on and we see that problem
still<00:02:42.390> where<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.010> light<00:02:44.250> bulb<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.700> casting<00:02:45.180> a

still where the light bulb is casting a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.040 
still where the light bulb is casting a
shadow<00:02:46.340> what<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.270> go<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.960> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
shadow what we can do is go to the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.690 
shadow what we can do is go to the
details<00:02:49.620> tab<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.340> turn<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.030> near<00:02:51.450> clipping

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
details tab and turn on near clipping

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.100 
details tab and turn on near clipping
now<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.760> get<00:02:54.090> an<00:02:54.180> extra<00:02:54.360> widget<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.080> your

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
now you get an extra widget on your

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.860 
now you get an extra widget on your
light<00:02:55.470> hair<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:56.220> allows<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.700> drag<00:02:57.450> this

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
light hair that allows you to drag this

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.010 
light hair that allows you to drag this
clipping<00:02:58.380> plane<00:02:58.860> out<00:02:59.270> now<00:03:00.270> another<00:03:00.540> important

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
clipping plane out now another important

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.870 
clipping plane out now another important
thing<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.320> remember<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:01.950> there's<00:03:02.400> near

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
thing to remember is that there's near

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.990 
thing to remember is that there's near
near<00:03:03.420> clipping<00:03:03.810> goes<00:03:04.020> from<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:05.010> which

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
near clipping goes from and to which

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.760 
near clipping goes from and to which
basically<00:03:06.420> means<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.960> this<00:03:07.140> blue<00:03:07.410> line<00:03:07.440> I'm

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
basically means that this blue line I'm

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.400 
basically means that this blue line I'm
dragging<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.340> only<00:03:08.490> one<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.030> parameters

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
dragging is only one of the parameters

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.840 
dragging is only one of the parameters
will<00:03:10.410> actually<00:03:10.800> need<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.010> extend<00:03:11.400> both

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
will actually need to extend both

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.630 
will actually need to extend both
parameters<00:03:12.270> as<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.960> see<00:03:13.170> here<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:14.130> order<00:03:14.490> to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
parameters as you see here in order to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.810 
parameters as you see here in order to
take<00:03:14.850> advantage<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:17.580> going

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
take advantage of it so I'm just going

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.080 
take advantage of it so I'm just going
to<00:03:18.110> move<00:03:19.110> things<00:03:19.440> around<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.060> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
to move things around so that so that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.080 
to move things around so that so that
they<00:03:21.360> fit<00:03:21.630> well<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.580> we<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:23.730> our<00:03:23.850> near

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
they fit well and we have our near

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.920 
they fit well and we have our near
clipping<00:03:24.570> right<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:26.450> let's<00:03:27.450> start<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
clipping right here let's start in the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.250 
clipping right here let's start in the
end<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:29.330> what<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.600> do<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.110> we<00:03:31.230> can

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
end of it what we can do is we can

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.680 
end of it what we can do is we can
render<00:03:31.920> again<00:03:32.190> we<00:03:32.850> see<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.240> problem<00:03:33.570> is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
render again we see that the problem is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.140 
render again we see that the problem is
still<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:34.459> that's<00:03:35.459> because<00:03:35.730> there's<00:03:35.910> one

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
still there that's because there's one

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.449 
still there that's because there's one
more<00:03:36.330> option<00:03:36.570> we<00:03:36.870> need<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.140> enable<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.740> that's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
more option we need to enable and that's

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.060 
more option we need to enable and that's
in<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> shadow<00:03:38.970> tab<00:03:39.330> we<00:03:40.140> need<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.440> check<00:03:40.770> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
in the shadow tab we need to check the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.660 
in the shadow tab we need to check the
box<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.400> says<00:03:41.520> clipping<00:03:42.360> influence<00:03:43.459> if<00:03:44.459> we

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
box that says clipping influence if we

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.850 
box that says clipping influence if we
render<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.240> more<00:03:45.420> time<00:03:45.720> we'll<00:03:46.380> see<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.680> this

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
render one more time we'll see that this

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.040 
render one more time we'll see that this
time<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.430> our<00:03:47.700> shadow<00:03:48.000> look<00:03:48.600> down<00:03:48.810> here

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
time we have our shadow look down here

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.430 
time we have our shadow look down here
by<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.200> cube<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.830> see<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:55.110> light<00:03:55.410> is

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
by the cube to see it and the light is

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.430 
by the cube to see it and the light is
influencing<00:03:56.250> properly<00:03:57.020> now<00:03:58.020> in<00:03:58.260> my

influencing properly now in my
experience<00:03:59.510> situations<00:04:00.510> like<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:00.900> come<00:04:01.140> up

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
experience situations like this come up

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.620 
experience situations like this come up
pretty<00:04:01.500> rarely<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.300> thought<00:04:03.480> it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
pretty rarely but I just thought it

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.330 
pretty rarely but I just thought it
would<00:04:03.690> be<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> cool<00:04:04.170> way<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.320> show<00:04:04.680> how<00:04:05.130> this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
would be a cool way to show how this

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.580 
would be a cool way to show how this
clipping<00:04:05.610> feature<00:04:05.970> works<00:04:06.330> if<00:04:07.170> i<00:04:07.350> were<00:04:07.500> to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
clipping feature works if i were to

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.010 
clipping feature works if i were to
shove<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.280> clipping<00:04:08.640> plane<00:04:08.910> back<00:04:09.240> inside<00:04:09.810> of

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
shove the clipping plane back inside of

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.380 
shove the clipping plane back inside of
the<00:04:10.140> light<00:04:10.320> bulb<00:04:10.590> like<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:11.070> we<00:04:11.910> should<00:04:12.150> see

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
the light bulb like this we should see

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.180 
the light bulb like this we should see
the<00:04:12.540> shadow<00:04:12.810> obscure<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.530> entire<00:04:13.830> scene

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
the shadow obscure the entire scene

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.390 
the shadow obscure the entire scene
again<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.780> while<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> really<00:04:17.070> strange

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
again so while this is a really strange

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.120 
again so while this is a really strange
example<00:04:17.970> i<00:04:18.150> hope<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.350> gives<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:19.919> good

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
example i hope that it gives you a good

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.630 
example i hope that it gives you a good
idea<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.640> how<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.060> feature<00:04:21.330> can<00:04:21.480> be<00:04:21.660> used<00:04:22.020> and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
idea of how this feature can be used and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.560 
idea of how this feature can be used and
in<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:24.450> real<00:04:25.290> scene<00:04:25.710> your<00:04:26.460> lighting<00:04:26.820> setup<00:04:27.210> is

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
in a real scene your lighting setup is

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.850 
in a real scene your lighting setup is
probably<00:04:27.780> going<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.170> be<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.530> bit<00:04:28.620> more

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
probably going to be a little bit more

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.210 
probably going to be a little bit more
complex<00:04:29.280> complex<00:04:29.910> than<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.710> hope<00:04:31.950> you

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
complex complex than this so I hope you

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.860 
complex complex than this so I hope you
enjoyed<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.520> tip<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.180> it's<00:04:33.510> kind<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:33.780> a

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
enjoyed that tip and it's kind of a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.480 
enjoyed that tip and it's kind of a
weird<00:04:33.900> one<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.770> wanted<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.070> get<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.400> out

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
weird one but I wanted to get it out

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.240 
weird one but I wanted to get it out
there<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.650> until<00:04:37.650> next<00:04:37.830> time<00:04:38.120> see<00:04:39.120> ya
