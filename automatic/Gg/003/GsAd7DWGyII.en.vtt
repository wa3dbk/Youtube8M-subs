which makes you and me just cogs in a
much<00:01:21.780> grander<00:01:22.110> schematic<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.840> mean<00:01:24.840> someone

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
much grander schematic I mean someone

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
much grander schematic I mean someone
obviously<00:01:25.920> had<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.580> stop<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> whole<00:01:27.180> thing<00:01:27.450> at

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
obviously had to stop the whole thing at

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.990 
obviously had to stop the whole thing at
the<00:01:27.659> beginning<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:29.070> their<00:01:29.460> law<00:01:29.700> has

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the beginning but now their law has

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.600 
the beginning but now their law has
taken<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> life<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.930> its<00:01:31.110> own<00:01:32.360> life<00:01:33.360> its<00:01:33.720> own

hypothetically someone found a way if

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.740 
hypothetically someone found a way if

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
they could fool the IDS I guess they

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.740 
they could fool the IDS I guess they
