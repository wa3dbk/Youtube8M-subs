00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.410 
make a cute little ladder first thing
inside<00:00:30.929> our<00:00:31.140> case<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.219> troop<00:00:32.820> wooden

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
inside our case we have a troop wooden

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
inside our case we have a troop wooden
purchase<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.559> also<00:00:34.680> characteristics

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
purchase these are also characteristics

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
purchase these are also characteristics
we<00:00:36.180> decided<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> natural<00:00:37.770> look<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
we decided to go to a natural look and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.000 
we decided to go to a natural look and
use<00:00:38.640> gum<00:00:38.879> tree<00:00:39.120> sticks<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.899> buddies<00:00:40.770> are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
use gum tree sticks because buddies are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
use gum tree sticks because buddies are
native<00:00:41.460> Australian<00:00:42.030> animals<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.320> would<00:00:43.410> be

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
native Australian animals so it would be

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
native Australian animals so it would be
more<00:00:43.770> natural<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.520> other<00:00:44.789> than<00:00:45.180> wooden

that's got bells in them so that they
make<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.170> nice<00:01:58.320> noise<00:01:58.619> when<00:01:58.950> they

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
make it really nice noise when they

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.410 
make it really nice noise when they
shake<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.520> around<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.369> then<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.210> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
shake them around and then we have this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.010 
shake them around and then we have this
ladder<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.439> also<00:02:04.829> made<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.600> we<00:02:06.600> use<00:02:06.780> putter

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
ladder up I also made and we use putter

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.550 
ladder up I also made and we use putter
pop<00:02:07.259> sticks<00:02:08.060> instead<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.239> sticks<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.410> go

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
pop sticks instead of sticks to go

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.450 
pop sticks instead of sticks to go
across<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.250> we

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
across but we

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.370 
across but we
do<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.790> sticks<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.600> make<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.500> big<00:02:13.740> edge<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.760> it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
do you sticks to make the big edge of it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860 
do you sticks to make the big edge of it
then<00:02:16.380> over<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.130> at<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.610> calcium<00:02:18.000> patch<00:02:18.330> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
then over here at this calcium patch it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630 
then over here at this calcium patch it
helps<00:02:19.290> trim<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.740> nails<00:02:19.860> which<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.370> really

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
helps trim the nails which is really

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.190 
helps trim the nails which is really
good<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.180> don't<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.510> sharp<00:02:21.720> nails<00:02:21.990> on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
you then up here we have a charcoal and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.480 
you then up here we have a charcoal and
iodine<00:02:26.700> bell<00:02:27.510> which<00:02:28.220> helps<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.310> their

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
iodine bell which helps with their

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.660 
iodine bell which helps with their
digestion<00:02:30.290> then<00:02:31.290> above<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.890> lat<00:02:32.070> out<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.430> have

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
digestion then above the lat out we have

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.390 
digestion then above the lat out we have
this<00:02:32.880> cattle<00:02:33.360> barn<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.740> helps<00:02:35.100> trim

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
this cattle barn and this helps trim

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.550 
this cattle barn and this helps trim
their<00:02:35.610> beak<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.540> big<00:02:36.780> doesn't<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.290> over

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
their beak so that big doesn't get over

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.420 
their beak so that big doesn't get over
guard<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.150> metal<00:02:40.080> Don<00:02:43.430> then

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
guard and that's just metal Don then

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670 
guard and that's just metal Don then
that<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.940> their<00:02:45.180> happy<00:02:45.570> hub<00:02:45.810> where<00:02:46.530> they

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
can look at themselves in the mirror

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720 
can look at themselves in the mirror
