00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:53.300 
really easy to do again I think this
isn't<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.080> I<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.259> now<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.069> what<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
isn't what I do now but this is what I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.150 
isn't what I do now but this is what I
used<00:01:53.849> to<00:01:53.940> do<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.300> back<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> day<00:01:55.129> when<00:01:56.129> I

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
used to do way back in the day when I

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.969 
used to do way back in the day when I
was<00:01:56.399> bulking<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> wasn't<00:01:57.750> doing<00:01:58.050> food<00:01:58.530> combined

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
was bulking I wasn't doing food combined

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.499 
was bulking I wasn't doing food combined
I<00:01:59.220> actually<00:01:59.369> never<00:01:59.640> even<00:01:59.849> heard<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:00.360> word

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I actually never even heard of the word

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630 
I actually never even heard of the word
I<00:02:00.690> never<00:02:00.750> knew<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.379> concept<00:02:01.920> YouTube

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I never knew of the concept YouTube

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.320 
I never knew of the concept YouTube
never<00:02:02.970> existed<00:02:03.690> when<00:02:03.959> I<00:02:04.399> was<00:02:05.399> first<00:02:05.970> starting

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
never existed when I was first starting

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.419 
never existed when I was first starting
out<00:02:06.599> so<00:02:06.929> there<00:02:07.140> wasn't<00:02:07.410> a<00:02:07.470> lot<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.679> conflicting

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
out so there wasn't a lot of conflicting

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
out so there wasn't a lot of conflicting
information<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.599> easy<00:02:09.840> for

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
information out there so it's easy for

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.720 
information out there so it's easy for
me<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.440> decisions<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.160> used<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> just
