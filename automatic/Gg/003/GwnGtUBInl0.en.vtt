00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.750
 take a square sheet and then alas 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.750
 in two 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.019
 open is bent in the other direction 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 open and then every corner on the center 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.890
 once you have this form it 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.910
 must bend one side towards the center do 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.910
 attention to be well aligned 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.999
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.119
 open it all to get that shape 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.479
 then you have to pay this part towards 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.860
 the middle in two like those held 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.040
 good to prevent this tip from 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.040
 moves 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.410
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.990
 then open both keeping well 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.600
 little flat triangles now he 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.740
 must pay this end 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.840
 in this part for that can is 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.350
 gone inward like those of the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.350
 two sides 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.650
 once you have this form it 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.550
 must there be this part to the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.850
 bottom and the triangle will end up at 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.850
 good place 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.310
 can be the same on the other side 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.090
 if you want the front hold 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.140
 perfectly you can always 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.140
 add some glue
