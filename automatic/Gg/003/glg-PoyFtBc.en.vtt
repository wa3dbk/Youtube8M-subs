00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
updated Sona red color these are the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
updated Sona red color these are the
Jimmy<00:00:49.440> Anderson<00:00:49.710> original<00:00:50.280> boots<00:00:50.520> however<00:00:51.210> if

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
Jimmy Anderson original boots however if

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.000 
Jimmy Anderson original boots however if
you<00:00:51.360> compare<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> mids<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.860> much

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you compare the mids there are much

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
you compare the mids there are much
higher<00:00:53.250> cut<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> means<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.110> I'd

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
higher cut and what that means is I'd

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.930 
higher cut and what that means is I'd
probably<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> better<00:00:56.309> what

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
probably that we can see it better what

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
probably that we can see it better what
that<00:00:57.090> means<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:57.960> ankle

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that means is there's a much more ankle

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.040 
that means is there's a much more ankle
support<00:00:58.980> around<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> top<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.960> if

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
support around at the top of that so if

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
support around at the top of that so if
you<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> section<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.640> where

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you look all of this section here where

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
you look all of this section here where
it's<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.660> sort<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> material<00:01:04.409> cushioning<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's this sort of material cushioning is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's this sort of material cushioning is
what's<00:01:05.939> been<00:01:06.150> added<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> vectors<00:01:08.070> as

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
what's been added on to the vectors as

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.789 
what's been added on to the vectors as
you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.290> ensures

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you can see there and that just ensures

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.460 
you can see there and that just ensures
that<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> big<00:01:12.630> fast<00:01:12.960> bowler<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that if you are a big fast bowler if you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.690 
that if you are a big fast bowler if you
look<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> people<00:01:14.040> who<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.280> been<00:01:14.430> using

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
look at the people who have been using

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
look at the people who have been using

the mid Falls last year and now the
vector<00:01:17.009> mid<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.820> looking<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.150> people<00:01:18.450> like

someone like a Jimmy Anderson who they
originally<00:01:36.720> made<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.829> shorter

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
originally made for little bit shorter

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
originally made for little bit shorter
perhaps<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.700> doing<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.240> protection<00:01:39.479> but

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
perhaps not doing as much protection but

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
perhaps not doing as much protection but
really<00:01:40.110> values<00:01:40.439> having<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> vectors<00:01:41.180> really

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
really values having the vectors really

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170 
really values having the vectors really
nice<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.200> nimble<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:44.070> feet<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.970> that's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
nice and nimble on your feet and that's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
nice and nimble on your feet and that's
something<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.439> about<00:01:46.500> these

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
something that I really like about these

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
something that I really like about these
and<00:01:47.159> guys<00:01:47.310> there's<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> few<00:01:47.820> technicalities<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and guys there's a few technicalities to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
and guys there's a few technicalities to
work<00:01:48.930> through<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.350> shoes<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.159> always

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
work through with shoes as there always

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.429 
work through with shoes as there always
is<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:51.329> flip<00:01:51.479> over<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> bottom<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> start

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
is will flip over to the bottom to start

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
is will flip over to the bottom to start
Yuman<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:53.460> they've<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.030> grid

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

adding<00:02:10.560> power<00:02:10.709> vector<00:02:11.099> video<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
adding power vector video but what that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
adding power vector video but what that
does<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.170> land

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
does is when you land

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220 
does is when you land
is<00:02:13.920> obviously<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> right<00:02:14.550> hand<00:02:14.940> shoe<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.050> when

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
is obviously the right hand shoe so when

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.350 
is obviously the right hand shoe so when
you<00:02:16.320> land<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.830> imagine<00:02:17.010> bowling<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:17.940> if

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you land if you imagine bowling here if

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.900 
you land if you imagine bowling here if
I<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:18.750> underneath<00:02:19.080> your<00:02:19.740> foot<00:02:20.190> will

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
I get it from underneath your foot will

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120 
I get it from underneath your foot will
instead<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.570> folding<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.380> itself<00:02:22.530> because

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
instead of folding in on itself because

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.970 
instead of folding in on itself because
there's<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.640> spike<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.390> your<00:02:25.080> shoe<00:02:25.410> will

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
there's this spike here your shoe will

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.050 
there's this spike here your shoe will
naturally<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.480> land<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.170> turn<00:02:28.560> in

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
naturally want to land and turn in

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.550 
naturally want to land and turn in
towards<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.210> outer<00:02:30.510> where<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.410> no

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
towards the outer where there is no

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680 
towards the outer where there is no
spike<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.520> imagine<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.970> land<00:02:33.240> here<00:02:33.360> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
spike so you imagine you land here that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.960 
spike so you imagine you land here that
spike<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.380> goes<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> ground<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.730> foot

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
spike there goes in the ground the foot

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.720 
spike there goes in the ground the foot
will<00:02:36.120> rotate<00:02:36.740> outwards<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.950> compensate<00:02:38.550> for

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
will rotate outwards to compensate for

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.340 
will rotate outwards to compensate for
that<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.600> means<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.050> when<00:02:40.230> you're

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that and what that means is when you're

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.050 
that and what that means is when you're
landing<00:02:40.590> you're<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.490> twisting

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
landing you're not going to be twisting

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.020 
landing you're not going to be twisting
over<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:43.050> massively<00:02:43.770> reduces<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.820> risk

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
over and that massively reduces the risk

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.770 
over and that massively reduces the risk
of<00:02:45.290> knee<00:02:46.290> pacifically<00:02:47.250> knee<00:02:48.120> injuries<00:02:48.600> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
of knee pacifically knee injuries and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.990 
of knee pacifically knee injuries and
ankle<00:02:49.320> injuries<00:02:49.710> as<00:02:49.860> well<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> idea<00:02:50.880> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
ankle injuries as well so the idea with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.480 
ankle injuries as well so the idea with
the<00:02:51.120> vector<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.170> spike<00:02:52.620> configuration

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
the vector is this spike configuration

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.970 
the vector is this spike configuration
will<00:02:53.970> actually<00:02:54.330> reduce<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.110> propensity<00:02:55.680> for

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
will actually reduce the propensity for

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.850 
will actually reduce the propensity for
fast<00:02:56.400> bowlers<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.150> injured<00:02:57.510> now<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.530> next

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
fast bowlers to get injured now the next

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.680 
fast bowlers to get injured now the next
thing<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> talk<00:02:59.310> about<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.760> this<00:03:00.090> internal

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
thing to talk about is this internal

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.540 
thing to talk about is this internal
vector<00:03:01.200> strap<00:03:01.470> now<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.070> lot<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.250> fast

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
famous for them and what that is is it's

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.830 
famous for them and what that is is it's
ridiculously<00:03:59.520> good<00:03:59.730> cushioning<00:04:00.180> there<00:04:00.420> so

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
ridiculously good cushioning there so

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.810 
ridiculously good cushioning there so
that<00:04:00.990> when<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.260> are<00:04:01.290> landing<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.400> foot<00:04:02.700> and

that when you are landing your foot and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.300 
that when you are landing your foot and
your<00:04:03.270> heel<00:04:03.300> specifically<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:04.980> get<00:04:05.160> a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
your heel specifically is going to get a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.520 
your heel specifically is going to get a
lot<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.700> support<00:04:06.030> there<00:04:06.510> it's<00:04:06.900> equatable<00:04:07.350> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
lot of support there it's equatable to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.140 
lot of support there it's equatable to
something<00:04:07.770> like<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.980> 1/6<00:04:08.130> gel<00:04:08.610> zone<00:04:08.880> for

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
something like the 1/6 gel zone for

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.240 
something like the 1/6 gel zone for
example<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:10.170> what<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.440> idea<00:04:10.800> behind<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
example that's what the idea behind the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.980 
example that's what the idea behind the
adiprene<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.850> now<00:04:12.570> we'll<00:04:12.720> look<00:04:12.780> at<00:04:12.900> them

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
adiprene is now we'll look at them

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.170 
adiprene is now we'll look at them
stylistically<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:14.310> main<00:04:14.790> difference

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
stylistically the main difference

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.030 
stylistically the main difference
obviously<00:04:15.540> are<00:04:15.630> these<00:04:15.780> dots<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.770> you've<00:04:16.859> got

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
obviously are these dots that you've got

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.289 
obviously are these dots that you've got
going<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.580> here<00:04:17.700> there's<00:04:17.910> nothing<00:04:18.030> like

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
going on in here there's nothing like

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.150 
going on in here there's nothing like
that<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.810> vector<00:04:19.200> firstly<00:04:19.950> they<00:04:20.100> do

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
that on the vector firstly they do

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.159 
that on the vector firstly they do
actually<00:04:20.489> identify<00:04:21.359> them<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:21.690> separate<00:04:22.049> to

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
actually identify them as separate to

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.260 
actually identify them as separate to
the<00:04:22.200> vector<00:04:22.440> mid<00:04:22.770> secondly<00:04:23.640> what<00:04:23.760> they<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:23.970> is

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
the vector mid secondly what they do is

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.200 
the vector mid secondly what they do is
they<00:04:24.390> are<00:04:24.540> really<00:04:24.810> good<00:04:24.930> for<00:04:24.990> ventilation

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
they are really good for ventilation

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.219 
they are really good for ventilation
chances<00:04:26.539> are<00:04:26.660> you're<00:04:26.810> not<00:04:26.840> going<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.110> be<00:04:27.169> a

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
chances are you're not going to be a

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.080 
chances are you're not going to be a
spinner<00:04:27.530> walking<00:04:27.919> off<00:04:28.039> two<00:04:28.220> paces<00:04:28.490> wearing

spinner walking off two paces wearing

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.670 
spinner walking off two paces wearing
these<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.509> that<00:04:29.960> means<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.229> can<00:04:30.350> be<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.470> big

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
these and that means you can be a big

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.409 
these and that means you can be a big
fast<00:04:30.979> ball<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.460> running<00:04:31.759> in<00:04:31.910> getting<00:04:32.180> quite

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
fast ball of running in getting quite

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.510 
fast ball of running in getting quite
sweaty<00:04:32.750> getting<00:04:33.110> quite<00:04:33.350> hot<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.979> these<00:04:34.310> are

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
sweaty getting quite hot and these are

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.219 
sweaty getting quite hot and these are
absolutely<00:04:35.090> perfect<00:04:35.389> for<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:36.050> because

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
absolutely perfect for that because

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.570 
absolutely perfect for that because
they've<00:04:36.349> got<00:04:36.500> that<00:04:36.530> ventilation<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.310> keep<00:04:37.460> you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
they've got that ventilation to keep you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.469 
they've got that ventilation to keep you
nice<00:04:37.699> and<00:04:37.759> fresh

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
nice and fresh

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.070 
nice and fresh
another<00:04:39.199> really<00:04:39.440> subtle<00:04:39.979> feature<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:41.990> you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
another really subtle feature is if you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.839 
another really subtle feature is if you
really<00:04:42.259> zoom<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.590> on<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.770> materials<00:04:43.370> here

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
really zoom in on the materials here

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.909 
really zoom in on the materials here
towards<00:04:44.300> these<00:04:44.479> three<00:04:44.840> stripes<00:04:45.199> that's<00:04:45.800> a

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
towards these three stripes that's a

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.830 
towards these three stripes that's a
plain<00:04:46.190> sort<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.550> grained<00:04:46.880> leather<00:04:47.300> there<00:04:47.630> I

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
plain sort of grained leather there I

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.089 
plain sort of grained leather there I
don't<00:04:48.080> know<00:04:48.289> whether<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:48.530> guys<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:48.949> get<00:04:49.069> a

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
don't know whether you guys can get a

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.469 
don't know whether you guys can get a
good<00:04:49.340> shot<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.639> that<00:04:49.880> when<00:04:50.030> that's<00:04:50.210> fully

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
good shot of that when that's fully

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.960 
good shot of that when that's fully
zoomed<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:51.050> whereas<00:04:51.800> comparatively<00:04:52.729> if<00:04:52.849> you

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
zoomed in whereas comparatively if you

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.370 
zoomed in whereas comparatively if you
bear<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.360> hold<00:04:53.690> that<00:04:53.780> thought<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.229> your<00:04:54.319> mind

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
bear that hold that thought in your mind

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.089 
bear that hold that thought in your mind
will<00:04:55.130> then<00:04:55.310> have<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.580> look<00:04:55.759> at<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.509> new<00:04:56.690> ones

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
will then have a look at the new ones

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.469 
will then have a look at the new ones
now<00:04:58.099> that's<00:04:58.340> more<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.639> a<00:04:58.669> sort<00:04:58.849> of<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.970> pimpled

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
now that's more of a sort of a pimpled

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.020 
now that's more of a sort of a pimpled
style<00:05:00.080> texture<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.190> what<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.550> means<00:05:01.789> is<00:05:01.940> it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
style texture and what that means is it

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.400 
style texture and what that means is it
should<00:05:02.300> potentially<00:05:02.630> be<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> little<00:05:03.289> bit

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
should potentially be a little bit

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.710 
should potentially be a little bit
harder<00:05:03.860> wearing<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:05.090> if<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.270> were<00:05:05.389> to<00:05:05.599> do

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
harder wearing and so if you were to do

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.930 
harder wearing and so if you were to do
it<00:05:05.840> maybe<00:05:06.080> these<00:05:06.289> have<00:05:06.410> been<00:05:06.470> designed

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
it maybe these have been designed

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.890 
it maybe these have been designed
specifically<00:05:07.940> for<00:05:08.060> Steven<00:05:08.539> Finn<00:05:08.720> who's

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
specifically for Steven Finn who's

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.390 
specifically for Steven Finn who's
always<00:05:09.139> falling<00:05:09.530> over<00:05:09.800> at<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:09.949> crease<00:05:10.190> and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
always falling over at the crease and

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.969 
always falling over at the crease and
dragging<00:05:11.360> issue<00:05:11.509> along<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.110> ground<00:05:12.380> because

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
dragging issue along the ground because

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.920 
dragging issue along the ground because
what<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.340> means<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.759> it<00:05:13.910> should<00:05:14.240> in<00:05:14.449> theory

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
what that means is it should in theory

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.719 
what that means is it should in theory
be<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.139> little<00:05:15.410> bit<00:05:15.560> harder<00:05:16.009> wearing<00:05:16.430> for<00:05:16.639> the

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
be a little bit harder wearing for the

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.240 
be a little bit harder wearing for the
fast<00:05:16.970> bowler<00:05:17.270> another<00:05:18.229> feature<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:18.889> and

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
fast bowler another feature I like and

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.070 
fast bowler another feature I like and
they've<00:05:19.610> got<00:05:19.759> a<00:05:19.789> slight<00:05:20.120> difference<00:05:20.509> here<00:05:20.570> is

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
they've got a slight difference here is

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.629 
they've got a slight difference here is
you've<00:05:21.289> got<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.560> sort<00:05:21.740> of<00:05:21.830> leather<00:05:22.370> there's

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
you've got this sort of leather there's

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.309 
you've got this sort of leather there's
a<00:05:22.669> lot<00:05:22.789> more<00:05:22.909> sort<00:05:23.120> of<00:05:23.180> this<00:05:23.690> leather<00:05:23.960> on<00:05:24.199> the

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
a lot more sort of this leather on the

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.689 
a lot more sort of this leather on the
vector<00:05:24.680> wears<00:05:25.039> it<00:05:25.159> seems<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.520> lot<00:05:25.610> more

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
vector wears it seems to be a lot more

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.999 
vector wears it seems to be a lot more
synthetic<00:05:25.940> on<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.479> vector<00:05:26.630> mid<00:05:27.020> so<00:05:27.590> on<00:05:27.889> the

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
synthetic on the vector mid so on the

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.800 
synthetic on the vector mid so on the
toe<00:05:28.250> on<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.520> vector<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:29.120> you've<00:05:29.599> got<00:05:29.690> this

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
toe on the vector and you've got this

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.930 
toe on the vector and you've got this
leather<00:05:30.080> sort<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.560> air<00:05:30.680> tough<00:05:31.099> panel<00:05:31.490> where<00:05:31.699> at

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
leather sort of air tough panel where at

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.379 
leather sort of air tough panel where at
the<00:05:32.030> front

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
the front

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.839 
the front
whereas<00:05:33.139> on<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.500> vector<00:05:33.620> mid<00:05:34.099> you've<00:05:34.669> got

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
whereas on the vector mid you've got

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.659 
whereas on the vector mid you've got
these<00:05:35.000> um<00:05:35.300> these<00:05:35.690> sort<00:05:36.289> of<00:05:36.320> a<00:05:36.440> Adi<00:05:37.130> -<00:05:37.340> stripes

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
these um these sort of a Adi - stripes

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.279 
these um these sort of a Adi - stripes
almost<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.300> know<00:05:38.389> a<00:05:38.419> lot<00:05:38.599> of<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.810> stripes<00:05:39.110> do

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
almost you know a lot of the stripes do

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.110 
almost you know a lot of the stripes do
to<00:05:39.409> go<00:05:39.530> there<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.889> add<00:05:40.009> that<00:05:40.280> extra<00:05:40.460> toughness

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
to go there to add that extra toughness

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.209 
to go there to add that extra toughness
because<00:05:41.539> obviously<00:05:42.110> there's<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.680> famous<00:05:42.889> story

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
because obviously there's a famous story

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.430 
because obviously there's a famous story
that<00:05:43.340> shobak<00:05:43.880> tar<00:05:44.150> or<00:05:44.570> a<00:05:44.630> lot<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.780> fast<00:05:45.050> bowlers

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
that shobak tar or a lot of fast bowlers

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.860 
that shobak tar or a lot of fast bowlers
cut<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.860> toe<00:05:46.099> and<00:05:46.460> cut<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.300> front<00:05:47.509> out<00:05:47.719> of

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
cut the toe and cut the front out of

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.870 
cut the toe and cut the front out of
there<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.259> they're<00:05:48.889> fast<00:05:49.130> bowling<00:05:49.340> shoe<00:05:49.699> so

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
there and they're fast bowling shoe so

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.700 
there and they're fast bowling shoe so
that<00:05:49.969> their<00:05:50.090> toes<00:05:50.330> when<00:05:50.570> you<00:05:50.719> land<00:05:50.990> your<00:05:51.440> toes

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
that their toes when you land your toes

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.249 
that their toes when you land your toes
thrust<00:05:52.340> forward<00:05:52.789> into<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.150> shoe<00:05:53.389> and<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:54.169> if

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
thrust forward into the shoe and so if

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.360 
thrust forward into the shoe and so if
they<00:05:54.380> cut<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.680> open<00:05:54.949> it's<00:05:55.039> much<00:05:55.219> more

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
they cut it open it's much more

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.860 
they cut it open it's much more
comfortable<00:05:55.669> whereas<00:05:56.539> a<00:05:56.630> lead-acid

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
comfortable whereas a lead-acid

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.779 
comfortable whereas a lead-acid
obviously<00:05:57.320> taken<00:05:57.680> that<00:05:57.770> online<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.639> when

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
obviously taken that online and when

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.189 
obviously taken that online and when
they<00:05:58.909> thrust<00:05:59.150> forward<00:05:59.539> here<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.900> shoe<00:06:00.080> is

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
they thrust forward here the shoe is

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.700 
they thrust forward here the shoe is
very<00:06:00.229> very<00:06:00.800> strong<00:06:01.190> towards<00:06:01.909> the<00:06:02.090> front<00:06:02.360> guys

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
very very strong towards the front guys

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.110 
very very strong towards the front guys
so<00:06:03.710> all<00:06:03.740> in<00:06:04.099> all<00:06:04.159> I<00:06:04.310> think<00:06:04.520> these<00:06:04.610> are<00:06:04.759> a<00:06:04.789> really

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
so all in all I think these are a really

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.870 
so all in all I think these are a really
really<00:06:05.270> good<00:06:05.810> shoe<00:06:06.020> for<00:06:06.320> a<00:06:06.560> hit<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.190> deck<00:06:07.400> fast

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
really good shoe for a hit the deck fast

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.879 
really good shoe for a hit the deck fast
bowler<00:06:08.210> who's<00:06:08.810> potentially<00:06:09.199> worried<00:06:09.770> about

an injury or anyone is potentially

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.209 
an injury or anyone is potentially

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
you have a look here they're coming up

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.420 
you have a look here they're coming up
at<00:06:30.740> a<00:06:30.800> UK<00:06:31.340> 11<00:06:32.120> but<00:06:32.810> significantly<00:06:33.469> aus<00:06:33.979> eleven

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
at a UK 11 but significantly aus eleven

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.399 
at a UK 11 but significantly aus eleven
and<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.550> half<00:06:34.580> so<00:06:35.330> there<00:06:35.449> is<00:06:35.539> only<00:06:35.659> a<00:06:35.810> half<00:06:36.110> size

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
and a half so there is only a half size

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:37.990 
and a half so there is only a half size
difference<00:06:36.770> between<00:06:36.949> the<00:06:37.039> US<00:06:37.250> and<00:06:37.400> the<00:06:37.460> UK<00:06:37.669> and

difference between the US and the UK and

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.490 
difference between the US and the UK and
that<00:06:38.120> means<00:06:38.599> they<00:06:38.719> can<00:06:38.750> come<00:06:39.199> up

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
that means they can come up

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.890 
that means they can come up
a<00:06:39.530> little<00:06:39.920> bit<00:06:40.070> small<00:06:40.520> so<00:06:41.180> if<00:06:41.360> you<00:06:41.480> are<00:06:41.630> someone
