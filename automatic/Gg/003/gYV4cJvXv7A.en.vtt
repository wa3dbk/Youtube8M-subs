 Hello everyone, again Lech 917 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.510
 Surgut 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.070
 Well, I have a new set buffer 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.849
 to myself 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.260
 Active anything because normally plays well 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.400
 and most importantly decided to make 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.400
 roof insulation 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.330
 I'll show you now 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.040
 so from this angle it will be uncomfortable 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 let's get a little then I share the same 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:36.020
 hence, I also took the standard 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.400
 vibration isolation layer 2 millimeters to 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 millimeter to the roof will normally be like 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.660
 since it is not very heavy stick 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 well, as always, I repeat the main thing 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.200
 to have at least 70 80 percent here 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.940
 total insulation insulation made 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:01.680
 vibro on insulation noise insulation i 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.930
 took captive 8 millimeters not in rub 4 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.370
 millimeter so nothing good stuff 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.330
 approximately it looks like a picture like this 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:16.170
 here we have this vibration 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.659
 This we already insulation captured at a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.630
 plan accordingly is here 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.960
 such vibration isolation is the most important guys 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 when you stick a spline a little 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.310
 you also warm it up with a hair dryer only 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.110
 Strongly as we suppose vibration isolation and a little 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 just to make the glue slightly melt and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.210
 stuck more well the important thing is these 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 here are the rails you do not paste them because 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 that if you hop glue you then the roof 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.799
 will not sit down accordingly technological 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.540
 holes all 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.210
 left as something guys will still 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.850
 cover the roof with a carpet internal 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.860
 we will write down the casing 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.729
 how to make the best of everything good 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.380
 bye everyone 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.380
 do it yourself
