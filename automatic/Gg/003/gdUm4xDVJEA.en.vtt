and<00:00:11.130> portions<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.389> remind<00:00:12.780> me<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
and portions of it remind me of the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.379 
and portions of it remind me of the
belkin<00:00:13.620> grip<00:00:13.650> view<00:00:14.160> as<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.940> will<00:00:15.089> soon<00:00:15.330> see

out and i'll walk you through it rather
quickly<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.930> interesting<00:00:25.439> thing<00:00:25.500> about

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
quickly here the interesting thing about

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490 
quickly here the interesting thing about
this<00:00:26.070> case<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> hybrid

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
this case it's kind of like a hybrid

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
this case it's kind of like a hybrid
case<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> sense<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:30.150> bottom

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
case in the sense that this bottom

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.459 
case in the sense that this bottom
portion<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.730> flexible<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:33.960> it's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
portion is flexible as you can see it's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
portion is flexible as you can see it's
not<00:00:34.649> too<00:00:34.860> flexible<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.520> mean<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.880> provided<00:00:36.450> some

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
not too flexible I mean I provided some

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
not too flexible I mean I provided some
force<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.940> all<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
force to get it to do that but all of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
force to get it to do that but all of
this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> TPU<00:00:42.500> TPU<00:00:43.500> silicone<00:00:43.800> mix<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this is like a TPU TPU silicone mix so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.600 
this is like a TPU TPU silicone mix so
it's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.200> gotta<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> stretch

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it's not you know gotta going to stretch

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
it's not you know gotta going to stretch
over<00:00:48.000> time<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.750> should<00:00:49.020> retain<00:00:49.440> its

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
over time on you it should retain its

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.299 
over time on you it should retain its
shape<00:00:50.960> however<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.440> gives<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> enough<00:00:52.980> give

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
shape however it gives you enough give

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
shape however it gives you enough give
that<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> button<00:00:54.300> presses<00:00:54.690> aren't<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that the button presses aren't all that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
that the button presses aren't all that
difficult<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> where<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> gets

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
difficult this is where it gets

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.020 
difficult this is where it gets
interesting<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.629> top<00:00:57.930> half<00:00:58.699> it's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> hard

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
interesting this top half it's a hard

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
interesting this top half it's a hard
plastic<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> doesn't<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.379> gift<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
plastic so it doesn't have gift so it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.049 
plastic so it doesn't have gift so it's
going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> give<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.910> more

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
going to give you a little bit more

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
going to give you a little bit more
protection<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> reason<00:01:04.379> why

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
protection there and the reason why

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
protection there and the reason why
they've<00:01:04.739> done<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.519> case<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.270> they

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
they've done this with this case is they

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
they've done this with this case is they
say<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> protects<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> also<00:01:07.830> makes<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
say it protects but it also makes it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
say it protects but it also makes it
easy<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> slide<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.840> pocket

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
easy to slide in and out of your pocket

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
easy to slide in and out of your pocket
and<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.920> found<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.490> true<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.510> how

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and I have found that to be true so how

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.050 
and I have found that to be true so how
does<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.020> work<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.860> put<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.220> basically

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
does this work to put it on basically

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.249 
does this work to put it on basically
you<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> slide<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> top

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you want to slide it in from the top

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
you want to slide it in from the top
first<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.100> remember<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> top<00:01:17.790> portion

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
first because remember that top portion

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.249 
first because remember that top portion
is<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> give<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.229> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is not really going to give all that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
is not really going to give all that
much<00:01:19.560> give<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.880> click<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.479> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
much give and then just click it in on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.679 
much give and then just click it in on
the<00:01:22.110> bottom<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.100> gives<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:24.150> pretty<00:01:24.450> good

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the bottom it gives some pretty good

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.260 
the bottom it gives some pretty good
protection<00:01:25.560> around<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.250> edges<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.030> don't

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
protection around the edges so you don't

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.950 
protection around the edges so you don't
really<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.750> gaps<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.549> there<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.509> bit<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
really see gaps there there is a bit of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
really see gaps there there is a bit of
play<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.229> should<00:01:34.500> say<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> side<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> if

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
play I should say on the side so that if

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030 
play I should say on the side so that if
you've<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.360> screen<00:01:36.900> protector<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.650> don't

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you've got a screen protector I don't

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.069 
you've got a screen protector I don't
think<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> cause<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
think this is really going to cause it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.889 
think this is really going to cause it
to<00:01:40.110> bubble<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.490> nice<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to bubble up so that's kind of nice the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.630 
to bubble up so that's kind of nice the
change<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.560> case<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> previous

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
change in this case from the previous

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
change in this case from the previous
belkin's<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.840> these<00:01:45.960> buttons<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:46.560> not

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
belkin's is that these buttons are not

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.190 
belkin's is that these buttons are not

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
difficult to press at all so as you can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.740 
difficult to press at all so as you can
see<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> pressure<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
see a little bit of pressure and it is

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.200 
see a little bit of pressure and it is
registering<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:53.280> kind<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.759> nice<00:01:53.939> as

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
registering so that's kind of nice as

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
registering so that's kind of nice as
well<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.990> onwards<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> things

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
well now onwards to some of the things

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
well now onwards to some of the things
that<00:01:56.460> maybe<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.850> don't<00:01:57.149> care<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.840> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that maybe I don't care for about this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.980 
that maybe I don't care for about this
case<00:01:58.369> your<00:01:59.369> volume<00:01:59.850> are<00:02:00.119> part<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.719> your

rocker switch for the mute that's really
hard<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.979> at<00:02:05.130> you've<00:02:05.610> got<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.180> some

hard to get at you've got to have some
length<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.439> nail<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.039> actually<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
length of a nail to actually get in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
length of a nail to actually get in
there<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:08.940> switch<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.599> thing<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
there and switch that thing to on and
off<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.150> bit<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
off so that's a bit of a

other<00:02:19.500> thing<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.980> don't<00:02:20.220> care<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.640> too

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
other thing that I don't care for too

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.840 
other thing that I don't care for too
much<00:02:20.970> about<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.500> clear<00:02:23.190> area<00:02:23.580> while

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
much about this is this clear area while

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.500 
much about this is this clear area while
it's<00:02:24.150> nice<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.740> look<00:02:26.069> closely<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.209> you

may not see it here actually I think you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.199 
may not see it here actually I think you
can<00:02:30.480> there<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.930> those<00:02:31.080> scratches<00:02:32.209> it's

surprising<00:02:36.390> there's<00:02:36.750> also<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.140> bit<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
surprising there's also a bit of a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.410 
surprising there's also a bit of a
rainbow<00:02:37.800> effect<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.459> certain<00:02:38.820> lights<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
rainbow effect in certain lights and I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.490 
rainbow effect in certain lights and I
don't<00:02:39.600> know<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.810> you're<00:02:39.959> able<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.290> catch<00:02:40.470> that

don't know if you're able to catch that

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.800 
don't know if you're able to catch that
in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> video<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.360> trust<00:02:42.569> me<00:02:42.690> on
