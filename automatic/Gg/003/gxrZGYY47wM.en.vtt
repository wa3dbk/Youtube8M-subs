00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
effort that what we had been told about

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.350 
effort that what we had been told about
the<00:01:44.750> African<00:01:45.020> bees<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.880> they<00:01:46.880> didn't<00:01:47.270> make

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.100 
pollinators they were impossible to
manage<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.550> found<00:01:53.509> that<00:01:53.690> all<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:53.960> those<00:01:54.050> things

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
manage I found that all of those things

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.950
