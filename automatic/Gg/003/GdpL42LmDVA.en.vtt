think to resist putting your name on the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.609 
think to resist putting your name on the
line<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.570> something's<00:01:09.570> wrong<00:01:09.720> if

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
for that is probably not a biblical

Corinthians<00:01:59.850> 12<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.719> 14<00:02:01.140> where<00:02:02.100> Paul<00:02:02.399> uses<00:02:02.969> the

Corinthians 12 to 14 where Paul uses the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.340 
Corinthians 12 to 14 where Paul uses the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
word member in a body analogy right but

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
word member in a body analogy right but
the<00:02:07.649> local<00:02:08.190> church<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.179> global

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the local church not just a global

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.390 
the local church not just a global
Church<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> local<00:02:11.489> church<00:02:11.879> is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
Church but the local church is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.460 
Church but the local church is
about<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.180> reasonably<00:02:14.450> know<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.750> local<00:02:15.350> and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
about you reasonably know it's local and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.980 
about you reasonably know it's local and
not<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.830> global<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.520> because<00:02:16.940> while<00:02:17.660> in

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
not just global is because while in

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.410 
not just global is because while in
Ephesians<00:02:18.530> 1<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.280> Colossians<00:02:19.940> he<00:02:20.060> talks

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
Ephesians 1 and Colossians he talks

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.990 
Ephesians 1 and Colossians he talks
about<00:02:20.569> Christ<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.740> head<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> body<00:02:22.550> in

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
about Christ as the head of the body in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.050 
about Christ as the head of the body in
first<00:02:23.870> Corinthians<00:02:24.440> 12<00:02:24.740> he's<00:02:25.520> talking<00:02:25.970> about

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
first Corinthians 12 he's talking about

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.010 
first Corinthians 12 he's talking about
head<00:02:26.720> with<00:02:26.990> eyes<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.980> ears<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.580> are<00:02:29.020> members

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
head with eyes and ears that are members

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.060 
head with eyes and ears that are members
of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.620> body<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.780> body<00:02:33.020> analogy<00:02:33.800> has

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
of the body and so the body analogy has

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.420 
of the body and so the body analogy has
one<00:02:34.340> global<00:02:34.910> meaning<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.230> has<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:36.770> local

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
one global meaning and it has one local

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.270 
one global meaning and it has one local
meaning<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.390> there's<00:02:38.600> global<00:02:39.290> membership

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
meaning and so there's global membership

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.670 
meaning and so there's global membership
in<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.820> body<00:02:41.150> universal<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.140> there's<00:02:42.350> local

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
in the body universal and there's local

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.960 
in the body universal and there's local
membership<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.400> body<00:02:43.550> where<00:02:43.760> I'm<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
membership in the body where I'm a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.050 
membership in the body where I'm a
finger<00:02:44.780> or<00:02:44.989> I'm<00:02:45.410> an<00:02:45.530> eye<00:02:45.709> or<00:02:46.040> I'm<00:02:46.190> an<00:02:46.340> ear<00:02:46.820> or

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
finger or I'm an eye or I'm an ear or

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.860 
finger or I'm an eye or I'm an ear or
I'm<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.660> foot<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.380> everybody<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.630> member<00:02:50.630> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
I'm a foot and everybody is a member and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.500 
I'm a foot and everybody is a member and
so<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> word<00:02:51.680> member<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:52.430> 1st<00:02:52.730> Corinthians<00:02:53.209> 12

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
so the word member in 1st Corinthians 12

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.949 
so the word member in 1st Corinthians 12
to<00:02:53.540> 14<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:54.530> part<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.459> local<00:02:55.959> organism

organic coherence to it and it's very

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.780 
organic coherence to it and it's very
hard<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.239> do<00:03:12.080> what<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.530> Bible<00:03:12.739> calls<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.519> church

here it can put me out of anything I'm
not<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.940> anything<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.380> think<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.680> lot<00:03:54.890> of

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
not in anything and I think a lot of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.890 
not in anything and I think a lot of
people<00:03:55.400> don't<00:03:55.610> want<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.790> be<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.090> anything

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
people don't want to be in anything

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.080 
people don't want to be in anything
because<00:03:57.350> they<00:03:57.620> don't<00:03:57.799> even<00:03:57.980> like<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.670> idea<00:03:59.030> of

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
because they don't even like the idea of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.840 
because they don't even like the idea of
being<00:03:59.390> able<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.750> be<00:03:59.870> put<00:04:00.079> out<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.320> something<00:04:00.890> so

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
being able to be put out of something so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.930 
being able to be put out of something so
for<00:04:02.690> all<00:04:02.810> those<00:04:03.019> reasons<00:04:03.110> I<00:04:03.620> think<00:04:03.940> even

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
for all those reasons I think even

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.610 
for all those reasons I think even
though<00:04:05.090> there's<00:04:05.269> no<00:04:05.390> sentence<00:04:05.959> in<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.260> Bible

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
though there's no sentence in the Bible

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.590 
though there's no sentence in the Bible
that<00:04:06.650> says<00:04:07.040> there<00:04:07.459> is<00:04:07.790> such<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> thing<00:04:08.269> as

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
that says there is such a thing as

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.360 
that says there is such a thing as
church<00:04:08.780> membership<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.680> thou<00:04:09.829> shalt<00:04:10.160> be<00:04:10.340> a

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.390 
church member
I<00:04:11.239> think<00:04:11.989> it's<00:04:12.200> implied<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:12.920> nature<00:04:13.310> of
