00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.840 

okay<00:00:01.469> let's<00:00:01.620> talk<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.860> motor<00:00:02.310> coder<00:00:02.610> code

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay let's talk about motor coder code

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.579 
okay let's talk about motor coder code
is<00:00:02.970> different<00:00:03.449> than<00:00:03.629> anything<00:00:03.959> else<00:00:04.259> out

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
is different than anything else out

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.209 
is different than anything else out
there<00:00:04.879> because<00:00:05.879> it's<00:00:06.480> not<00:00:06.629> an<00:00:06.960> additive<00:00:10.219> so

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
there because it's not an additive so

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.879 
there because it's not an additive so
let's<00:00:11.429> let's<00:00:11.820> start<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:13.650> temp

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
let's let's start with the temp

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.310 
let's let's start with the temp

roller<00:00:19.050> bearing<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.220> they<00:00:20.640> were<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
roller bearing and they were going to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.720 
roller bearing and they were going to
test<00:00:21.470> versity<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.560> oils<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.070> their<00:00:23.279> bearings

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
test versity of oils on their bearings

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.519 
test versity of oils on their bearings
and<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.660> where<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.960> started

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
and that's where it's where it started

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.099 
and that's where it's where it started
and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> reputation<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and then it got a reputation because it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.660 
and then it got a reputation because it
used<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.349> come<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> one-armed<00:00:29.250> bandit

bearings are under pressure right here
when<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> thirty<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.239> fulcrum

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
when you this is a thirty to one fulcrum

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.209 
when you this is a thirty to one fulcrum
at<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> bottom<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> fulcrum<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
at the bottom of the fulcrum is a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
at the bottom of the fulcrum is a
one-pound<00:00:53.789> weight<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.750> puts<00:00:55.079> thirty<00:00:55.379> pounds

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
one-pound weight that puts thirty pounds

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.610 
one-pound weight that puts thirty pounds
of<00:00:55.829> pressure<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.140> got<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> hundred<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
of pressure on here I got a hundred and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.939 
of pressure on here I got a hundred and
I<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.920> four<00:00:59.129> ways<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.289> that's<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> hundred<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I get four ways so that's a hundred and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
I get four ways so that's a hundred and
twenty<00:01:02.250> pounds<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.670> pressure<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
twenty pounds of pressure on that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.179 
twenty pounds of pressure on that
bearing<00:01:06.500> obviously<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> freeze

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
