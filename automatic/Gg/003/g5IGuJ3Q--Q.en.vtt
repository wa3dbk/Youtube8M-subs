00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello to all so today we find ourselves for a little video so 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.240
 this is the answer video from brussels afp 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.240
 % and not calyon with their eyes so had to do the same thing 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.259
 they put us mostly rooms that has a chart 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.300
 still today I lived in Ardeche 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.189
 I can also know you 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.039
 it's really for independent minus 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.749
 dismantling the wall 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.970
 it's not Switzerland but my god it's nice 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.239
 % so my life back there basically montélimar is missing the capital bangkok 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 for those who know 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.399
 with the rhône I spend at least 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.670
 Sunday 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.960
 hard discount which was very very often 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.570
 arriving on the island 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.090
 so here I went to the point I think more interesting so the corner 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.430
 bathers 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.780
 as a stylist just doing a small oratory 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.870
 sometimes I prefer the solo 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 strong duty 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.620
 more coca-cola 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.760
 so there you were bought with the wiring of the enemies 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.080
 in between triple 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 author am so to your left you were afraid of shooting 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.310
 so ps2 french more than 18 months me too that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.960
 even if good holding of the euro against 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 how did they do 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 with the next memory cards 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.170
 for the moment the only fault is nice even when you find a 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.570
 little bit of the game that dates all this 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.920
 it's always nice 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.920
 unfortunately on your right you have an option 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.020
 150 gigawatts 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.710
 even though 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.150
 as long as I had with m currently the package call of duty black ops' fire 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 the eighth edition of francs I will show his favor 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 so here you have the little accessory 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 it always seems to me 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.790
 for aluminum that turkey 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.990
 mika it's really practical in summer 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.790
 I went 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.640
 it's always nice a job you have a small controller so the black controller 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.259
 it's all new for you have the joystick 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.259
 the dark anne of the elite you cheat me 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.310
 with both sticks a grill 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.579
 the black hull 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.229
 underneath you have the xbox Thursdays where you go and modern shaped colmar 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.989

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.460
 stop redemption 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.589
 almost two years optional 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.589
 blackstone and pai you have microsoft world points 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.529
 the vtv 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.090
 the three movies including more dick boxer game 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.029
 of the vaucluse 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.009
 I patrol minus two of ps2 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.009
 you had platinium games 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 and that the twins world 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.119
 so it spends weeks in relief 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.119
 we crack through the cities to all that 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.660
 So here is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.189
 because on the second floor you have the collection of psp games of goddess 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.329
 one person 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.329

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:29.989
 above TV 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.429
 So here is - there is not much 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.729
 a small post m 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.489
 or lace-shaped 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.489
 the tickets for this fault 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.349
 you have a poster to give a monsanto blanket 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.829
 a small wink selection small dedication 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.180
 in front of him a drawing that graciously and 6% 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.449
 drawn by the death of his son 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.449
 so that few people we all know 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.129
 e then we will go to the stage finally the little weird 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.209
 so there you have cans we have you have my audio back 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.870
 8:20 pm mythical panassac breakers 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.870
 themes because we can not be anything special 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840
 we live a small month lamp 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.309
 here you have my bed 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:29.509
 pug 1140 francs 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.319
 for two people 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.319
 so we have one year you have 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.189
 the game boy no 25-year-old engineer blue cardboard 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.389
 the packaging either 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.870
 young people to come out of the south to show that a small point 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.939
 varin 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.900
 it's still weird 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 we must mention the pile of people choice 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.039
 next so you have the psp concil value of 2004 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.020
 is it in danger the ds but I'm not pro junior cup 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.430
 so one more thing 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.430
 why do I know my children 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.430
 there you are afraid of chargers to place his brothel 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.610
 it must be without panic it's really too much 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.190
 too many problems you've been the case I know where the cabinets that 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.339
 slide to put a touch 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.509
 you have a little austere of grand theft auto v city 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:32.879
 where you go 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.969
 the huge wardrobe 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.949

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.830
 really light recoil trick 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.009
 we have seen ecological so well started with the cans next 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.740
 it is the most sold package as a barrier of cortisone limited edition 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.310
 so with the 150 gigawatt console a joystick 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.779
 The classic 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.369
 the wi-fi the three cables for TV and xbox live one less 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:08.279

 really they are really nice a month 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.210
 it's a lot less than the price we paid 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.110
 she even saw a poster a new degree of ambition 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.110
 who is this simply 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.249

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.499
