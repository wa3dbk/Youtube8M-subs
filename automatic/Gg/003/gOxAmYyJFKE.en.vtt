00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.970 
that because I think that we use kind of
a<00:03:12.820> big<00:03:12.970> platform<00:03:13.240> for<00:03:13.720> episode<00:03:14.140> 1<00:03:14.170> but

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
a big platform for episode 1 but

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.130 
a big platform for episode 1 but
apparently<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.790> Sega<00:03:16.600> has<00:03:16.690> said<00:03:17.050> that

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
apparently and Sega has said that

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.450 
apparently and Sega has said that
they're<00:03:17.320> still<00:03:17.560> maintaining<00:03:18.040> close

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
they're still maintaining close

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.850 
they're still maintaining close
relationship<00:03:19.330> with<00:03:19.360> me<00:03:19.630> kinda<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.350> it's<00:03:20.590> kind

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
relationship with me kinda so it's kind

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.650 
relationship with me kinda so it's kind
of<00:03:20.950> assumed<00:03:21.460> now<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.060> maybe<00:03:22.240> it<00:03:22.420> might<00:03:22.450> be

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
of assumed now that maybe it might be

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.410 
of assumed now that maybe it might be
coming<00:03:23.020> out<00:03:23.140> for<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.440> Wii<00:03:23.620> U<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.700> want<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.239> talk

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.200 
but a narrower launch window for the wii
u<00:05:08.500> that's<00:05:08.800> exciting<00:05:09.159> right<00:05:09.400> we<00:05:09.970> thought

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
u that's exciting right we thought

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.420 
u that's exciting right we thought
before<00:05:10.509> either<00:05:11.139> april<00:05:11.770> through<00:05:11.949> december<00:05:12.280> but

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
before either april through december but

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.920 
before either april through december but
now<00:05:12.580> we<00:05:12.639> know<00:05:12.789> it's<00:05:12.970> june<00:05:13.210> through<00:05:13.449> december

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
now we know it's june through december

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.189 
now we know it's june through december
so<00:05:14.590> we<00:05:14.800> know<00:05:15.069> it<00:05:15.370> will<00:05:15.669> probably<00:05:16.210> be<00:05:16.479> shown<00:05:16.990> off

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
so we know it will probably be shown off

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.469 
so we know it will probably be shown off
at<00:05:17.440> e3<00:05:17.650> we<00:05:18.130> can<00:05:18.310> probably<00:05:18.699> expect<00:05:18.909> that<00:05:19.330> as

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
at e3 we can probably expect that as

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.649 
at e3 we can probably expect that as
well<00:05:19.690> as<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.990> actual<00:05:20.620> launch<00:05:20.949> date<00:05:21.250> for<00:05:21.280> it

heard<00:05:22.659> a<00:05:22.750> couple<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:23.080> rumors<00:05:23.409> also<00:05:23.770> over<00:05:23.889> the

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
heard a couple of rumors also over the

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.129 
heard a couple of rumors also over the
past<00:05:24.159> couple<00:05:24.310> weeks<00:05:24.719> people<00:05:25.719> are<00:05:25.780> saying<00:05:25.960> that

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
past couple weeks people are saying that

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.409
