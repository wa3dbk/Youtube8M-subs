minutes<00:01:37.720> well<00:01:38.720> we've<00:01:38.900> been<00:01:39.140> tracking<00:01:39.770> this

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
minutes well we've been tracking this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.330 
minutes well we've been tracking this
tour<00:01:40.369> about<00:01:40.869> 15<00:01:41.869> minutes<00:01:42.170> or<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:42.500> now<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.979> you

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
tour about 15 minutes or so now and you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.130 
tour about 15 minutes or so now and you
can<00:01:43.460> see<00:01:43.700> these<00:01:43.940> are<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.420> clumps<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:45.369> of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
can see these are the clumps of of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.969 
can see these are the clumps of of
butter<00:01:48.220> forming<00:01:49.220> up<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.380> jar<00:01:51.680> there

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
butter forming up in the the jar there

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.540 
butter forming up in the the jar there
and<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:54.590> reckon<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:54.979> that's<00:01:55.130> probably

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
and we reckon that that's probably

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.920 
and we reckon that that's probably
enough<00:01:58.550> now<00:01:59.619> to<00:02:00.789> take<00:02:01.789> out<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.149> jar<00:02:02.390> so

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
enough now to take out of the jar so

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.109 
enough now to take out of the jar so
I've<00:02:03.020> got<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.289> jar<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.920> kitchen<00:02:04.850> now<00:02:05.090> and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
I've got the jar in the kitchen now and

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.100 
I've got the jar in the kitchen now and
we'll<00:02:05.660> just<00:02:05.810> take<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.110> lid<00:02:06.410> off<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:07.030> as<00:02:08.110> you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
we'll just take the lid off and as you

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.250 
we'll just take the lid off and as you
can<00:02:09.289> see<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:11.510> butter<00:02:12.020> has<00:02:12.910> formed<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:14.260> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
can see the butter has formed up and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.370 
can see the butter has formed up and
we're<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.739> do<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.280> put<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.330> now<00:02:17.570> onto<00:02:18.080> a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
