00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.720 

so<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.050> the<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.920> guy<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.220> table<00:00:05.580> that's

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
so that the the guy on the table that's

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.040 
so that the the guy on the table that's
just<00:00:05.880> the<00:00:06.000> sensors<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.420> kind<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.600> calibrates

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050 
just the sensors that kind of calibrates

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.600 
just the sensors that kind of calibrates
everything<00:00:07.410> yes<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:07.979> basically<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.400> way<00:00:08.490> it

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
everything yes so basically the way it

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.570 
everything yes so basically the way it
works<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.510> base<00:00:09.900> here<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:11.310> midst<00:00:11.490> of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
works is the base here the midst of

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.820 
works is the base here the midst of
magnetic<00:00:12.000> field<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.080> controller's<00:00:13.560> pick

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
magnetic field and the controller's pick

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.680 
magnetic field and the controller's pick
that<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.010> and<00:00:14.280> use<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.850> return<00:00:15.060> position

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that up and use it to return position

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.950 
that up and use it to return position
and<00:00:15.810> orientation<00:00:16.260> data<00:00:17.060> using<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.810> can

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and orientation data using that we can

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.040 
and orientation data using that we can
get<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> really<00:00:19.470> low<00:00:19.800> latency<00:00:21.050> accurate

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
get a really low latency accurate

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.070 
get a really low latency accurate
one-to-one<00:00:23.390> manipulation<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> objects<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.020> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
one-to-one manipulation of objects in a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:58.800 
one-to-one manipulation of objects in a
game

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
around changing where the pain point is

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.510 
around changing where the pain point is
here<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.290> can<00:02:33.440> actually<00:02:33.740> use<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.370> one

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
here I can actually use the one to one

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
here I can actually use the one to one
mode<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.790> aim<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.660> laser<00:02:36.110> exactly<00:02:36.590> where<00:02:36.740> I

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
mode to aim that laser exactly where I

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:46.880 
mode to aim that laser exactly where I
want<00:02:37.010> it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.460 

how<00:02:47.430> long<00:02:47.580> did<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.730> take<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.030> master<00:02:48.330> it

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
how long did it take you to master it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.770 
how long did it take you to master it
maybe<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.560> day
