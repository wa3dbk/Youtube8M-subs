and again how we all gum just wanted to
show<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.839> car<00:00:07.140> guys<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:08.480> found<00:00:09.480> this

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
show you this car guys I found this

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.320 
show you this car guys I found this
couple<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.290> months<00:00:10.530> ago<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.519> taken<00:00:11.849> me

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
couple of months ago and it's taken me

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.390 
couple of months ago and it's taken me
this<00:00:12.540> long<00:00:12.599> day<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.590> actually<00:00:13.889> find<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.340> what

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this long day to actually find out what

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.120 
this long day to actually find out what
it<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.700> because<00:00:15.420> there's<00:00:15.599> no<00:00:16.130> identifying

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
it is because there's no identifying

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.320 
it is because there's no identifying
badges<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:17.789> anything<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.279> after

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
badges or anything on it and after

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.900 
badges or anything on it and after
sharing<00:00:21.330> around<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> internet<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
sharing around on the internet and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.580 
sharing around on the internet and
eventually<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.210> Facebook<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:25.080> night<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
eventually on Facebook the other night I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
eventually on Facebook the other night I
got<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> couple<00:00:26.699> suggestions<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
got a couple suggestions as to what it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.130 
got a couple suggestions as to what it
is<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:29.000> turns<00:00:30.000> out<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.579> 1949<00:00:33.140> 1950

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
is and turns out it's about a 1949 1950

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.860 
is and turns out it's about a 1949 1950
voxel<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.350> say<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> wyvern

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
voxel I think I think you say it wyvern

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
voxel I think I think you say it wyvern
I'm<00:00:39.870> sure<00:00:40.200> I'll<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.410> corrected<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> say

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I'm sure I'll be corrected on how to say

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
I'm sure I'll be corrected on how to say
it<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.270> yeah<00:00:43.260> anyway<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.270> 1949<00:00:45.590> 1950

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it but yeah anyway it's a 1949 1950

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.819 
it but yeah anyway it's a 1949 1950
voxel<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.690> thought<00:00:49.020> I'd<00:00:49.140> come<00:00:49.469> back<00:00:49.620> out

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
voxel so I thought I'd come back out

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
voxel so I thought I'd come back out
guys<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.129> show<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
guys and show you a little bit around it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.490 
guys and show you a little bit around it
we<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.719> little<00:00:55.350> bit

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
we go as you can see it's a little bit

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
we go as you can see it's a little bit
beyond<00:00:55.949> restoring<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.770> its<00:00:58.980> heyday<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
beyond restoring but in its heyday it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
beyond restoring but in its heyday it
would<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.120> been<00:01:00.270> quite<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> nice<00:01:01.170> looking<00:01:01.590> car

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
would have been quite a nice looking car

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.490 
would have been quite a nice looking car
really<00:01:02.239> well<00:01:03.239> under<00:01:03.510> cool<00:01:03.750> things<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
really well under cool things on this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.820 
really well under cool things on this
car<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> fuel<00:01:07.860> filler<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> pushing<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
car is the fuel filler so pushing the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.580 
car is the fuel filler so pushing the
top<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.760> pops<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.560> well<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
top of it then it pops it up well that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.840 
top of it then it pops it up well that
was<00:01:13.890> rather<00:01:14.490> cool<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> era<00:01:16.790> this<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
was rather cool for for the era this is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.690 
was rather cool for for the era this is
probably<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.799> better-looking<00:01:19.799> side<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
probably the better-looking side of it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.840 
probably the better-looking side of it
as<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.530> an<00:01:22.590> interesting<00:01:22.770> feature<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
as you can see an interesting feature is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.840 
as you can see an interesting feature is
the<00:01:24.000> front<00:01:24.659> doors<00:01:25.040> suicide<00:01:26.040> doors<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.520> open

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the front doors suicide doors they open

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960 
the front doors suicide doors they open
backwards<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.820> one

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
backwards and that was that was one

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.310 
backwards and that was that was one
thing<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.240> had<00:01:30.479> me<00:01:30.630> stumped<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> was

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
thing that had me stumped when I was

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.550 
thing that had me stumped when I was
trying<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.740> identify<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.840> this

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
trying to identify it because of this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.100 
trying to identify it because of this
era<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.009> weren't<00:01:35.220> too<00:01:35.400> many<00:01:35.430> cars<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.360> in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
era there weren't too many cars and in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830 
era there weren't too many cars and in
this<00:01:37.409> shape<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.979> had<00:01:38.369> suicide<00:01:39.210> doors<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this shape that had suicide doors at the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
this shape that had suicide doors at the
front<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.909> only<00:01:42.119> other<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.450> could

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
front and the only other one I could

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.469 
front and the only other one I could
find<00:01:42.750> was<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> Peugeot<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.119> 203

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
find was a Peugeot I think it was 203

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.580 
find was a Peugeot I think it was 203
pirjo<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> fuel<00:01:47.040> filler<00:01:48.049> as<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.380> see

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pirjo but the fuel filler as you can see

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.030 
pirjo but the fuel filler as you can see
back<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.210> he's<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:52.380> different<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
back here he's is different to the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:15.699 
back here he's is different to the
Peugeot<00:01:56.450> alright<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.049> look<00:01:58.200> inside
