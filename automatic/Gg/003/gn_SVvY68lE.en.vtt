00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 two 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.390
 but 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.120
 such friends of youtube good for them 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.099
 We speak 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.290
 and well, in this new tutorial what 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.930
 what are we going to talk about is the five 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.689
 typical problems that have to have 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.829
 a computer and likewise we will be 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.669
 giving solution let's start first 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.739
 we will talk first about when the pc 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.500
 decreases its performance may have 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.989
 many reasons that explain a decline in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.200
 pc performance the most common 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.290
 it can be presence of spyware record 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.950
 corrupt and unnecessary programs 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.340
 The solution is to check the programs that 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.850
 we have installed and uninstalled those that 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 We do not use 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.790
 the second option is to delete the files 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.480
 unnecessary that we have in our 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.480
 computer 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.340
 the third option is to gain performance and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.429
 speed of fragmenting the hard disk 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.310
 Another very common problem is that it appears 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.640
 in error screens and the programs will 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.880
 lock and close one of the causes more 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.609
 probable is that we have spyware or 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.130
 spy programs and that these be the 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.979
 cause of which the programs do not respond 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.289
 and must be finished is also the one of 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.439
 the legend that says the program does not 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.049
 it worked there was another reason another cause is 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.399
 that there are unnecessary windows files 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:48.369
 to execute them and they are corrupt another 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.429
 cause may be the lack of ram memory 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.909
 to use that product or that software the 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.549
 solution would be you could look at 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.159
 reinstall the program that does not work 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.159
 that works badly 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.179
 if the problem is already with windows it would be 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.640
 It is advisable not to format but to repair 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.190
 your windows if we notice that the problem 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.340
 it can come from the ram memory you will 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.150
 can add more virtual memory to the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.069
 pc and so optimize your performance another 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.890
 The most common problem is when the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.470
 computer restarts automatically 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.290
 or it turns off the possible causes are 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.950
 there can be two the presence of a worm 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.099
 or some apps or some obstruction is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.330
 say garbage and a bad connection inside 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.270
 from the cooler's cabinet 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.320
 The latter happens when the pc can not 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.760
 cool before reheating 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.850
 it simply goes off is to say that no 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 it can reheat if it is better turned off to 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.140
 protect yourself solutions if it comes to 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.420
 a virus then correspondingly 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.850
 run our antivirus to remove 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.130
 this problem if the problem is a 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.250
 obstruction or you see that you have dust 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.160
 inside your pc is to keep the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.460
 cabinet in a place where you are 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.950
 ventilated and not exposed to smoke if the 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.830
 problem persists the problem can be 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.990
 the source of your pc so you would have to 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.710
 check if it's okay if it's working 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.320
 correctly or if it is properly connected 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.290
 Another more common problem is when 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.350
 we hear strange noises and vibrations 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.600
 within our cabinet the possible 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.790
 causes are some cabinets some 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.130
 Cabinet or hardware components 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.590
 are failing either the cooler the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.650
 source and some cables are wrong 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.760
 connected or the board is badly connected 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.880
 here here the causes can be many 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.650
 the solution is to open the cabinet dry 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.350
 everything is well connected if 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.990
 we find if we do not find any 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.450
 anomaly then you have to look at the 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.490
 hardware that is not working well and 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.180
 one of the most common problems is 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.520
 when the home page or the search engine 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.320
 changed itself is to say that we do not 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.200
 we change it and when we open the 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.350
 browser appears another page of 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.200
 start another search engine here the cause is 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.360
 It is likely that we have been victims of 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.570
 a high hacking that means that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.120
 we have a spyware installed in our 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.550
 pc that may have come from both a 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.060
 downloaded file 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.570
 and executed as much as from a social network 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.510
 or from an email here the solution is 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.000
 likely that the spyware has installed 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.680
 a javascript in the browser for 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.980
 change personal options 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.740
 running some diagnostic program 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.940
 you can avoid the call to service 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.640
 technical likewise we can also 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.730
 do it ourselves by going to the 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.300
 configuration of our browser 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.270
 we give configuration and notice that in the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.580
 seeker is the search engine that we 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.920
 we want and in this way we select 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.500
 which browser do we want it to open and what 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.760
 home page we want us 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
 show 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.660
 and well, so far, the video 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.610
