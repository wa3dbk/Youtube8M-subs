the middle and the Styrofoam ball is
what<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:21.750> use<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.230> actually<00:00:22.410> attach<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
what we use to actually attach the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
what we use to actually attach the
orchids<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:23.880> we<00:00:24.180> use<00:00:24.390> pins<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.740> attach

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
orchids because we use pins to attach

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.710 
orchids because we use pins to attach
them<00:00:26.550> into<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.539> holds

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
them into this and this is what holds

them into this and this is what holds
them<00:00:28.019> into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> sphere<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.849> after<00:00:30.269> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
them into the sphere and then after it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.990 
them into the sphere and then after it's
all<00:00:30.570> tied<00:00:30.810> together<00:00:31.219> what<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.790> might

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
all tied together what we do is it might

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.660 
all tied together what we do is it might
be<00:00:33.149> hard<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.989> put<00:00:34.160> fishing<00:00:35.160> line<00:00:35.340> all

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
be hard to see we put fishing line all

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.850 
be hard to see we put fishing line all
the<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.880> around<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:37.050> help<00:00:37.230> hold<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> sphagnum

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the way around to help hold the sphagnum

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619 
the way around to help hold the sphagnum
Moss<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.489> which<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.239> keep<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
Moss in which is what will keep the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
Moss in which is what will keep the
roots<00:00:39.840> wet<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.620> stuff<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> entire<00:00:41.430> thing<00:00:41.760> with

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
roots wet we stuff the entire thing with

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
roots wet we stuff the entire thing with
sphagnum<00:00:42.120> Moss<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> nice<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.559> tight

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
sphagnum Moss so that is nice and tight

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
sphagnum Moss so that is nice and tight
the<00:00:44.190> next<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.120> hang<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> up

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the next thing we do when we hang it up

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.610 
the next thing we do when we hang it up
is<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.170> sure<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.440> have

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is you want to make sure you have

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
is you want to make sure you have
something<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.250> nice<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.460> sturdy<00:00:47.879> because

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
something really nice and sturdy because

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
something really nice and sturdy because
they<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.809> heavy<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:50.070> we've<00:00:50.219> used

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
they do get heavy and what we've used

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
they do get heavy and what we've used
here<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.120> used<00:00:51.600> coat<00:00:51.930> racks<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.469> usually

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
here is we used coat racks I usually

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.910 
here is we used coat racks I usually
start<00:00:53.520> off<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> taller<00:00:54.320> orchid<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.649> go<00:00:55.770> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
start off with a taller orchid to go on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
start off with a taller orchid to go on
the<00:00:56.070> top<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.930> with<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.530> bit

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the top and with this it's a little bit

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
the top and with this it's a little bit
easier<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> tell<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> taller

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
easier to tell which one is taller

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.119 
easier to tell which one is taller
because<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> darker<00:01:01.260> purple<00:01:01.469> ones<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
because the darker purple ones are a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.349 
because the darker purple ones are a
little<00:01:02.280> bit<00:01:02.520> taller<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.180> lighter

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
little bit taller than the lighter

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.070 
little bit taller than the lighter
purple<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> attach<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
purple so what we use to attach the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
purple so what we use to attach the
orchids<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.430> call<00:01:08.729> pins<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.540> these

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
orchids are what I call pins and these

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
orchids are what I call pins and these
can<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.110> made<00:01:10.320> from<00:01:10.590> any<00:01:10.830> really<00:01:11.310> strong<00:01:11.369> wire

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
can be made from any really strong wire

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.109 
can be made from any really strong wire
you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.840> also<00:01:13.020> use<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.560> from<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> cut<00:01:15.000> up

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you can also use them from if you cut up

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.859 
you can also use them from if you cut up
old<00:01:16.189> hangers<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.850> also<00:01:18.210> work<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.390> well

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
old hangers they also work really well

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.830 
old hangers they also work really well
you<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.170> bend<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.500> into<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.920> u-shape<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
you just bend them into the u-shape and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
you just bend them into the u-shape and
as<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:24.150> off<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
as I put them on I like to take off the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.679 
as I put them on I like to take off the
stakes<00:01:24.869> first<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> attach<00:01:27.330> them

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
stakes first so that when I attach them

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
stakes first so that when I attach them
to<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.860> sphere<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.520> pushing<00:01:29.790> down<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to the sphere when I'm pushing down the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.880 
to the sphere when I'm pushing down the
pin<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.930> accidentally<00:01:31.380> snap<00:01:31.710> any

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

it<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.240> tight<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> top<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.710> possible

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
it as tight up on the top as possible

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.840 
it as tight up on the top as possible
what<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.350> push<00:01:46.530> down<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
what we do is I just push down and that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.690 
what we do is I just push down and that
holds<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.630> hold<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> orchid<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.409> place

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
holds this will hold the orchid in place

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.560 
holds this will hold the orchid in place
sometimes<00:01:50.700> when<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.149> towards<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
sometimes when you get towards the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.990 
sometimes when you get towards the
bottom<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.259> use<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> few<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:53.070> than

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
bottom you have to use a few more than

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.899 
bottom you have to use a few more than
just<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:55.170> help<00:01:55.320> hold<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.759> go

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
just one to help hold it up as we go

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.050 
just one to help hold it up as we go
along<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.509> stake<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.740> some<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.460> some<00:01:59.670> projects

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
along we stake in some in some projects

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.399 
along we stake in some in some projects
with<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> work<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:00.869> stake<00:02:01.200> them

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
with the work is we don't stake them

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.950 
with the work is we don't stake them
right<00:02:01.560> away<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.520> once<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.090> starts<00:02:03.329> going<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
right away but once this starts going it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
right away but once this starts going it
gets<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.469> big<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.219> hard<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.520> reach<00:02:05.729> up

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
gets so big that it's hard to reach up

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.109 
gets so big that it's hard to reach up
at<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> top<00:02:06.420> again<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.649> want<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
at the top again so you want to just

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.620 
at the top again so you want to just
stake<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:10.190> so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
stake as you go so

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.550 
stake as you go so
you<00:02:11.930> push<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.350> into<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.680> styrofoam<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you push it into the styrofoam and the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.350 
you push it into the styrofoam and the
orchids<00:02:15.980> all<00:02:16.160> come<00:02:16.400> with<00:02:16.520> these<00:02:16.730> little<00:02:17.030> clips

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
orchids all come with these little clips

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.530 
orchids all come with these little clips
which<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.610> how<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.670> attach<00:02:20.120> them<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.360> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
which is how we attach them so this is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.570 
which is how we attach them so this is
what<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.720> would<00:02:23.870> consider<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.770> center<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
what I would consider the center of it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.670 
what I would consider the center of it
of<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.790> sphere<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.960> what<00:02:27.140> I'm<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.470> start

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
of the sphere so what I'm going to start

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.010 
of the sphere so what I'm going to start
to<00:02:27.800> do<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.130> work<00:02:28.430> my<00:02:28.640> way<00:02:28.850> from<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:29.630> and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
to do is work my way from this now and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.400 
to do is work my way from this now and
slide<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.660> you're<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:35.960> gonna<00:02:36.110> keep

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
slide this in so you're just gonna keep

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.500 
slide this in so you're just gonna keep
working<00:02:36.860> your<00:02:37.040> way<00:02:37.100> around<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.060> do<00:02:38.120> suggest

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
working your way around and I do suggest

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.450 
working your way around and I do suggest
that<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.870> don't<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.710> one<00:02:39.920> side<00:02:40.160> at<00:02:40.370> a

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
that you don't do just one side at a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.070 
that you don't do just one side at a
time<00:02:40.490> because<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.360> hard<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.870> match

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
time because it's really hard to match

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.500 
time because it's really hard to match
it's<00:02:43.040> easier<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.730> work<00:02:43.970> all<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.420> way

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it's easier just to work all the way

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.600 
it's easier just to work all the way
around<00:02:44.840> as<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.410> continue<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.860> move<00:02:46.070> around<00:02:46.220> it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
around as you continue to move around it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.060 
around as you continue to move around it
this<00:02:47.330> one<00:02:47.570> has<00:02:47.660> already<00:02:47.840> been<00:02:47.960> started<00:02:48.560> see

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
this one has already been started see

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.070 
this one has already been started see
obviously<00:02:49.730> as<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.120> see<00:02:50.360> we're<00:02:50.750> using<00:02:50.900> a

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
obviously as you can see we're using a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.050 
obviously as you can see we're using a
light<00:02:51.290> purple<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.890> dark<00:02:52.130> purple<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:52.700> they

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
light purple and a dark purple and they

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.820 
light purple and a dark purple and they
come<00:02:53.300> in<00:02:53.420> different<00:02:53.450> heights<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:54.590> really

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
come in different heights so it's really

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.440 
come in different heights so it's really
important<00:02:55.250> as<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.430> go<00:02:55.700> along<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.240> keep

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
important as you go along that you keep

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.630 
important as you go along that you keep
stepping<00:02:56.750> back<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.380> take<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> look<00:02:57.830> at<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
stepping back and take a look at it to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.090 
stepping back and take a look at it to
make<00:02:58.790> sure<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:59.240> you're<00:02:59.420> evenly

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
make sure that you're evenly

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.800 
make sure that you're evenly
distributing<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.550> different<00:03:02.030> sizes<00:03:02.270> of

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
distributing the different sizes of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.610 
distributing the different sizes of
stems<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.540> each<00:03:05.780> orchid<00:03:06.140> sphere<00:03:06.350> there<00:03:06.530> is

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
stems so in each orchid sphere there is

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.370 
stems so in each orchid sphere there is
about<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.920> hundred<00:03:07.220> orchids<00:03:07.960> okay<00:03:08.960> so<00:03:09.020> we're

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
about a hundred orchids okay so we're

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.320 
about a hundred orchids okay so we're
about<00:03:09.530> halfway<00:03:09.860> done<00:03:10.190> with<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.520> one<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.090> it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
about halfway done with this one and it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.320 
about halfway done with this one and it
takes<00:03:11.660> about<00:03:12.010> six<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.160> eight<00:03:13.190> hours<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.880> do<00:03:14.060> one

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
takes about six to eight hours to do one

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.400 
takes about six to eight hours to do one
orchid<00:03:14.780> sphere<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.490> we'll<00:03:17.210> check<00:03:18.020> in<00:03:18.200> later

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
orchid sphere so we'll check in later

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.760 
orchid sphere so we'll check in later
and<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.710> see<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.130> finished<00:03:19.550> one
