this lesson there's a link there's a B

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.010 
this lesson there's a link there's a B
and<00:00:56.399> C<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.510> grooves<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.899> each

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and C and there's two grooves in each

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860 
and C and there's two grooves in each
and<00:00:58.260> easy<00:00:58.859> medium<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> hard<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> say

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and easy medium and hard and when I say

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
and easy medium and hard and when I say
that<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.379> depends<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.190> school

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that it depends on what your school

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
that it depends on what your school
level<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> whether<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.719> find<00:01:03.899> them

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
level is as to whether you find them

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.630 
level is as to whether you find them
easier<00:01:04.320> whether<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> find<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:04.949> hard<00:01:05.159> but

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
easier whether you find them hard but

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
easier whether you find them hard but
that's<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.780> I've<00:01:06.930> broken<00:01:07.170> them<00:01:07.320> up

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that's kind of how I've broken them up

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
that's kind of how I've broken them up
okay<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:08.610> grooves<00:01:09.390> per

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
okay so I'm going to do two grooves per

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.250 
okay so I'm going to do two grooves per
thing<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:11.490> gonna<00:01:11.640> play<00:01:12.030> each<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.479> four

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
thing and I'm gonna play each one four

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
thing and I'm gonna play each one four
times<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.189> gonna<00:01:14.340> try<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.700> hardest<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
times and I'm gonna try my hardest to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.370 
times and I'm gonna try my hardest to
really<00:01:16.369> play<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> back<00:01:17.790> piece<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:19.049> strong

really play this back piece as as strong

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
really play this back piece as as strong
as<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.970> two<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> four

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and keeping everything else as soft as I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
and keeping everything else as soft as I
can<00:01:24.000> okay<00:01:24.950> here<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.460> gonna

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can okay here we go so I'm just gonna

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
can okay here we go so I'm just gonna
play<00:01:26.820> I'll<00:01:27.540> stop<00:01:27.840> after<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.259> stop<00:01:28.650> after<00:01:28.799> B<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
play I'll stop after a stop after B and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:02:54.460 
play I'll stop after a stop after B and
then<00:01:29.490> play<00:01:29.700> C<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.299> go

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.949 

okay<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.900> main<00:02:58.140> reason<00:02:58.170> why<00:02:58.769> IRA<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.970> see

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
okay so the main reason why IRA can see

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.960 
okay so the main reason why IRA can see
is<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> hardest<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.640> ended<00:03:02.850> up

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
is the hardest is because you ended up

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
is the hardest is because you ended up
having<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.300> do<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> end<00:03:04.050> up<00:03:04.140> having<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.410> do<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
having to do I end up having to do a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.160 
having to do I end up having to do a
double<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:06.269> put<00:03:06.420> your<00:03:06.540> back<00:03:06.720> beat<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.080> then

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
double you put your back beat and then

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.509 
double you put your back beat and then
it<00:03:07.290> immediately<00:03:07.620> after<00:03:08.010> you've<00:03:08.130> got<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> stop

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
it immediately after you've got a stop

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.590 
it immediately after you've got a stop
stroke<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.000> you've<00:03:09.120> ended<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.360> sort<00:03:09.540> of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
stroke so you've ended up sort of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.310 
stroke so you've ended up sort of
something<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:09.930> this

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.539 

alright<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.560> not<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.010> easiest<00:03:17.040> thing<00:03:17.459> to

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
alright so it's not the easiest thing to

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.710 
alright so it's not the easiest thing to
doing<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:17.910> takes<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> little<00:03:18.269> bit<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.510> time<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
doing it takes a little bit of time to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.370 
doing it takes a little bit of time to
get<00:03:18.810> used<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.910> but<00:03:20.910> overall<00:03:21.600> that's<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
get used to that but overall that's the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
get used to that but overall that's the
concept<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.610> can<00:03:23.760> apply<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> anything

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
concept and you can apply it to anything

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.610 
concept and you can apply it to anything
you<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:24.840> because<00:03:25.080> if<00:03:25.230> you're<00:03:25.320> playing<00:03:25.410> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
you like because if you're playing a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.250 
you like because if you're playing a
