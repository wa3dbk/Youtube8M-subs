00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
there is a second part of this where I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
there is a second part of this where I
go<00:01:45.630> fight<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> sixth<00:01:46.680> mob<00:01:46.829> or

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
go fight I think like the sixth mob or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.340 
go fight I think like the sixth mob or
something<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.250> six<00:01:47.549> spawn<00:01:47.729> shot<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
something like six spawn shot like that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
something like six spawn shot like that
and<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:50.040> risen<00:01:50.340> zombies<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:50.790> worry

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and these risen zombies don't worry

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.830 
and these risen zombies don't worry
about<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.299> believe<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.659> keep

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
about them I believe they keep

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.209 
about them I believe they keep
responding<00:01:52.549> but<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.180> said<00:01:54.240> every<00:01:54.689> fifth

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
responding but like I said every fifth

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.530 
responding but like I said every fifth
pack<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.579> boss<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> first

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
pack is a boss so here we have the first

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
pack is a boss so here we have the first
one<00:01:57.750> meathook<00:01:58.409> wasn't<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> then

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
one meathook wasn't like that and then

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.130 
one meathook wasn't like that and then
there's<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> twenty<00:02:00.180> second<00:02:00.540> weight<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
there's like a twenty second weight and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.770 
there's like a twenty second weight and
then<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:01.979> fight<00:02:02.340> wave<00:02:03.180> seven<00:02:03.630> through

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
then you go fight wave seven through

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.749 
then you go fight wave seven through
nine<00:02:03.840> week<00:02:04.140> four<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.259> tenth<00:02:04.500> boss<00:02:04.710> spawns<00:02:05.460> so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
nine week four the tenth boss spawns so

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.130 
nine week four the tenth boss spawns so

as you see I'm just killing them all in
this<00:02:07.290> section<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.280> very<00:02:08.580> varied<00:02:09.090> but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
this section it's very varied but

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.669 
this section it's very varied but
something<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.560> much

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
something like this you have so much

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
something like this you have so much
time<00:02:10.950> they're<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.670> easy<00:02:11.879> now<00:02:12.180> I'm<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
time they're so easy now I'm going to

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
so this is the next section that can

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.930 
so this is the next section that can
spawn<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:14.800> have<00:02:14.920> them<00:02:15.069> go<00:02:15.099> back<00:02:15.700> and

forth in two sections and once you start
this<00:02:18.580> hole<00:02:18.760> once<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.150> start<00:02:19.620> clearing<00:02:20.620> these

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
this hole once you start clearing these

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
this hole once you start clearing these
these<00:02:21.790> ads<00:02:22.030> you'll<00:02:22.300> notice<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.840> top<00:02:23.019> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
these ads you'll notice that the top of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.210 
these ads you'll notice that the top of
the<00:02:23.170> screen<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> time<00:02:23.920> limit<00:02:24.040> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the screen you have a time limit that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.490 
the screen you have a time limit that
starts<00:02:24.580> at<00:02:24.670> 25<00:02:25.000> minutes<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.690> that's<00:02:25.840> that's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
starts at 25 minutes and that's that's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.600 
starts at 25 minutes and that's that's
how<00:02:26.620> long<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:26.950> until<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.580> bronze<00:02:28.209> boss

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
start spawning these infinite Slayers

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.350 
start spawning these infinite Slayers
something<00:02:38.019> like<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.260> very<00:02:38.890> easy<00:02:39.299> maybe<00:02:40.299> I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
something like that very easy maybe I
