00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the cutting charts is 134 volts so we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.280 
the cutting charts is 134 volts so we
can<00:01:12.170> set<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.670> 134<00:01:13.670> volts<00:01:14.210> as<00:01:14.360> our<00:01:14.930> cutting

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
can set it to 134 volts as our cutting

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.350 
can set it to 134 volts as our cutting
voltage<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.280> higher<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.700> voltage<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.230 
plate if you go too low on voltage your
torch<00:01:21.740> will<00:01:22.010> dive<00:01:22.250> into<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.580> plate<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.090> will

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
torch will dive into the plate and will

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.390 
torch will dive into the plate and will
damage<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.720> consumables<00:01:24.320> very<00:01:24.740> frustrating

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
damage the consumables very frustrating

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.370 
damage the consumables very frustrating
so<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.119> always<00:01:26.390> safe<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.810> run<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> little<00:01:27.170> high

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
so it's always safe to run a little high

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.830 
so it's always safe to run a little high
on<00:01:27.680> your<00:01:27.979> first<00:01:28.250> cut<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.850> would<00:01:29.360> recommend

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
on your first cut I would recommend

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.440 
on your first cut I would recommend
running<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.470> up<00:01:30.590> about<00:01:30.920> 5<00:01:31.250> volts<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:32.030> safety

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
running that up about 5 volts for safety

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.050 
running that up about 5 volts for safety
you<00:01:32.630> can<00:01:33.229> change<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.799> while<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.159> is<00:01:34.250> cutting<00:01:34.549> so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
you can change it while it is cutting so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.880 
you can change it while it is cutting so
if<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.299> see<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.600> torch<00:01:35.840> getting<00:01:36.229> too<00:01:36.380> far<00:01:36.590> or

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
if you see the torch getting too far or

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.500 
if you see the torch getting too far or
too<00:01:36.920> close<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.549> material<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:38.150> can<00:01:38.330> come

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
too close to the material you can come

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.510 
too close to the material you can come
over<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.869> change<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.350> voltage<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.189> system

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
over and change this voltage the system

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.190 
over and change this voltage the system
will<00:01:40.640> immediately<00:01:40.909> respond<00:01:41.630> by<00:01:41.780> trying<00:01:42.110> to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
will immediately respond by trying to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.140 
will immediately respond by trying to
match<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.770> actual<00:01:43.280> voltage<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.790> your<00:01:43.909> set

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
match the actual voltage to your set

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.359 
match the actual voltage to your set
point<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:44.659> raising<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.380> set<00:01:45.650> point<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
point so raising the set point the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.010 
point so raising the set point the
voltage<00:01:46.729> will<00:01:46.880> come<00:01:47.030> up<00:01:47.210> raising<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.750> torch

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
voltage will come up raising the torch

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.590 
voltage will come up raising the torch
the<00:01:48.680> next<00:01:48.950> thing<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.220> set<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.670> your<00:01:49.909> feed<00:01:50.330> rate

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the next thing to set is your feed rate

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.660 
the next thing to set is your feed rate
the<00:01:51.170> feed<00:01:51.409> rate<00:01:51.650> is<00:01:51.860> going<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.189> be<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.490> inches

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670

where the machine was originally home

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.810 
where the machine was originally home
you<00:05:31.599> also<00:05:31.840> have<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.530> 0<00:05:32.889> X<00:05:33.099> Y<00:05:33.250> we<00:05:33.430> discussed

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
you also have the 0 X Y we discussed

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.029 
you also have the 0 X Y we discussed
earlier<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.690> load<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.229> service<00:05:35.560> positions

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
earlier the load and service positions

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.800 
earlier the load and service positions
you<00:05:36.430> can<00:05:36.580> program<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.210> where<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.510> want<00:05:37.690> the

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
you can program to where you want the

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.080 
you can program to where you want the
machine<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.169> go<00:05:38.470> when<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.610> click<00:05:39.880> that<00:05:39.909> button

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
machine to go when you click that button

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.760 
machine to go when you click that button
so<00:05:40.539> you<00:05:40.630> don't<00:05:40.659> have<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:40.960> jog<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.409> machine<00:05:41.740> out

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
so you don't have to jog the machine out

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.439 
so you don't have to jog the machine out
of<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.130> way<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.310> load<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.610> sheet<00:05:42.909> you<00:05:43.150> can<00:05:43.300> put

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
of the way to load a sheet you can put

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.939 
of the way to load a sheet you can put
the<00:05:43.570> load<00:05:43.720> position<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.710> torch

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
the load position so that the torch

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.710 
the load position so that the torch
should<00:05:45.130> say<00:05:45.280> say<00:05:45.580> at<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:45.820> back<00:05:46.030> left<00:05:46.360> of<00:05:46.599> the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
should say say at the back left of the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.560 
should say say at the back left of the
machine<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:47.370> this<00:05:48.370> will<00:05:48.610> allow<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.330> machine

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
machine and this will allow the machine

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.390 
machine and this will allow the machine
to<00:05:49.720> go<00:05:49.930> there<00:05:50.139> immediately<00:05:50.259> upon<00:05:50.979> clicking

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
to go there immediately upon clicking

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.649 
to go there immediately upon clicking
that<00:05:53.190> another<00:05:54.190> thing<00:05:54.400> you<00:05:54.490> can<00:05:54.669> do<00:05:54.820> is<00:05:55.060> zoom<00:05:55.389> in
