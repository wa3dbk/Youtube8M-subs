00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.220
 but the station disappeared 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.120
 do not just disappear if there are four and fourteen for each 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.049
 Maybe it's not that easy I did not research the stations 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.049
 unlike others 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.820
 with the "Liberty Sun" at night on Sunday three professional 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.519
 only lecture that reminds me of the school of this view 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 austerity package 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.810
 a legend tells of a team that also beats in a rich one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.539
 City Cottbus our imagination far surpasses attractive 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.219
 their walls were dependent on their architecture was so modern as is that 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 has not been reached again today, but when can I say they do 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.010
 on the seabed promise a big tidal wave 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.220
 the entire Intel was swallowed up by the sea and never seen again 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 Erfurt 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 I myself am called a neighbor 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.450
 he should do the deed 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.850
 but it is 18 years old and I become a covert action 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.910
 I had to say otherwise I would have put a shopping cart 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.210
 Main culprit is because they are absolutely right with all the respect it is like 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.080
 we know each other very well - which we will then hope that people will 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 but we find it a bit difficult to reach 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.200
 This is actually how it is and it has to be kept up 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
 it says 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.190
 here 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.250
 apparently something big is coming, he said 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 only on pressure of the authorities relieved 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.000
 the market for it 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 Maybe the minister does not see 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.370
 one has seen 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.370
 I think she is enormous 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.159
 With 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.589
 H 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.589
 4 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.389
 more 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.669
 the Red 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.669
 Peter Richter Rostock 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.489
 that's what their group is doing 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.109
 Bitburg explained that way 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.680
 as Thomas Gottschalk 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680
 I often do not go clean 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.499
 I was 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:39.459
 Franconia 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 man 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.969
 Nat 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.969
 I believe that this is what I am doing here 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.489
 the SPD had checked 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.039
 I knew that I forgot that
