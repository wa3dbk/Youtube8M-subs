there<00:01:22.070> we<00:01:22.220> go<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:22.520> what<00:01:22.670> we're<00:01:22.850> going<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.000> do

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
there we go so what we're going to do

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.050 
there we go so what we're going to do
here<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:24.229> just<00:01:24.530> read<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.860> code<00:01:27.939> so<00:01:28.939> it's

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
here is just read the code so it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.810 
here is just read the code so it's
telling<00:01:29.270> us<00:01:29.479> here<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:29.689> we<00:01:29.930> have<00:01:30.079> two<00:01:30.259> codes

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
telling us here that we have two codes

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.330 
telling us here that we have two codes
the<00:01:31.820> first<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.390> 0<00:01:32.420> 3<00:01:32.930> belt<00:01:33.530> tensioner<00:01:34.039> one

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
the first one is 0 3 belt tensioner one

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.649 
the first one is 0 3 belt tensioner one
passenger<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.770> next<00:01:40.070> code<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.490> code<00:01:41.270> 1<00:01:41.479> 1

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
passenger and the next code is code 1 1

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.410 
passenger and the next code is code 1 1
to<00:01:41.899> seat<00:01:42.350> occupancy<00:01:42.920> detector<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.149> sounds

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
to seat occupancy detector so it sounds

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.240 
to seat occupancy detector so it sounds
to<00:01:44.509> me<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:45.020> connection<00:01:45.860> underneath

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
to me like it's connection underneath

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.940 
to me like it's connection underneath
the<00:01:46.460> passenger<00:01:47.000> seat<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.649> we're<00:01:48.770> going<00:01:48.860> to

check that out and we'll come back and
even<00:01:51.649> clear<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.069> code<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.959> clear<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.170> air

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
to do is clear the code and then the air

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.660 
to do is clear the code and then the air
bag<00:02:17.540> light<00:02:18.040> should<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:20.540> out<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.799> ignition<00:02:22.310> on
