consistent to me studying pharmacology

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
consistent to me studying pharmacology
is<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.210> learning<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.750> new<00:01:39.900> language<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.560> have

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
studying pharmacology on Monday and then

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
studying pharmacology on Monday and then
not<00:01:52.380> looking<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> again<00:01:53.220> until<00:01:53.399> Friday

it's<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.930> very<00:01:55.200> hard<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it's going to be very hard for you to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.510 
it's going to be very hard for you to
feel<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:58.439> catching<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.189> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you're keeping the information so do a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.609 
you're keeping the information so do a
little<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.100> every<00:02:02.850> day<00:02:02.969> these<00:02:03.960> things<00:02:04.020> will

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
little bit every day these things will

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
little bit every day these things will
make<00:02:04.649> studying<00:02:05.189> pharmacology<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.390> much

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
make studying pharmacology so much
