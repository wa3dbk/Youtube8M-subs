on the bed and stuff it has a great
undulation<00:01:47.479> action<00:01:48.280> while<00:01:49.280> you're<00:01:49.399> working

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
undulation action while you're working

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.249 
undulation action while you're working
it<00:01:49.819> and<00:01:50.000> if<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.420> ever<00:01:50.539> want<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:50.959> hop<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.170> back

it and if you ever want to hop it back
up<00:01:51.410> again<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.800> separates<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.550> weight

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
up again it separates from the weight

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.850 
up again it separates from the weight
again<00:01:52.819> and<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.780> draws<00:01:53.959> back<00:01:54.259> into<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.649> again

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
again and it draws back into it again

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.919 
again and it draws back into it again
much<00:01:55.369> like<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.910> blue<00:01:56.179> yellow<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.539> feeding<00:01:56.840> on

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
much like a blue yellow is feeding on

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.540 
much like a blue yellow is feeding on
the<00:01:57.050> bottom<00:01:57.349> whenever<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.979> look<00:01:58.039> at<00:01:58.160> bluegill

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
the bottom whenever you look at bluegill

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.469 
the bottom whenever you look at bluegill
when<00:01:58.700> they're<00:01:58.819> feeding<00:01:58.970> on<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.179> bottom<00:01:59.390> they

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
when they're feeding on the bottom they

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.600 
when they're feeding on the bottom they
always<00:01:59.810> turn<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.319> side<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.890> that's<00:02:01.399> what

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
always turn to the side and that's what

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.130 
always turn to the side and that's what
we<00:02:01.729> wanted<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.030> do<00:02:02.119> one<00:02:02.360> incorporate<00:02:02.959> in<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
bait to wear it mimicked a bluegill and

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.309 
bait to wear it mimicked a bluegill and
that's<00:02:05.209> exactly<00:02:05.599> what<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.869> bait<00:02:06.050> will<00:02:06.170> do

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's exactly what this bait will do

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.930 
that's exactly what this bait will do
once<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.739> gets<00:02:06.890> down<00:02:07.069> in<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.399> area<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.880> you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
once it gets down in that area that you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.779 
once it gets down in that area that you
want<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.690> bait<00:02:08.869> will<00:02:08.989> roll<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.200> its<00:02:09.500> side

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
want it the bait will roll to its side

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.729 
want it the bait will roll to its side
