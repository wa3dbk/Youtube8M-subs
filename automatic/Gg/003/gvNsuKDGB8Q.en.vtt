because<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.679> am<00:00:32.460> doing<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
because that is what I am doing a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.780 
because that is what I am doing a
tutorial<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.480> right<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.170> setting<00:00:34.649> up

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
tutorial on right now is setting up

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.500 
tutorial on right now is setting up
through<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:36.120> computer<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:37.910> plotter<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
through your computer a plotter which is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.020 
through your computer a plotter which is
shared<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.770> another<00:00:41.370> computer<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
shared on another computer on a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
shared on another computer on a
peer-to-peer<00:00:42.360> network<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.829> choose<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
peer-to-peer network so you choose a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.970 
peer-to-peer network so you choose a
local<00:00:45.000> printer<00:00:45.270> attached<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.980> computer

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
local printer attached to this computer

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.720 
local printer attached to this computer
next<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.570> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> create<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.320> port<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
next we want to create a port we want to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580 
next we want to create a port we want to
create<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.030> local<00:00:51.449> port<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.020> choose<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> local

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
create a local port so we choose a local

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
create a local port so we choose a local
port<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.250> next<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> where<00:00:54.570> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
port which is next and this is where we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.590 
port which is next and this is where we
enter<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.550> information<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
enter the information of where the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
enter the information of where the
plotter<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:59.039> computer<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
plotter is on the other computer this is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.840 
plotter is on the other computer this is
the<00:01:11.189> address<00:01:13.040> ok<00:01:14.040> we're<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> click<00:01:14.729> OK

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the address ok we're going to click OK

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
the address ok we're going to click OK
but<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> give<00:01:15.990> us<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.200> error

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
but this is going to give us an error

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.429 
but this is going to give us an error
because<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.710> am<00:01:16.830> NOT<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.900> network<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
because I am NOT on that network at this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.030 
because I am NOT on that network at this
time<00:01:20.840> show<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> hair<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.890> gives

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
time show you hair right there it gives

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.070 
time show you hair right there it gives
me<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> network<00:01:24.630> what

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
me because I'm not on the network what

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.940 
me because I'm not on the network what
we're<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.770> tutorial

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
we're going to do for this tutorial

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
we're going to do for this tutorial
those<00:01:26.430> we're<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.479> name

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
those we're just going to put in a name

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
those we're just going to put in a name
CC<00:01:28.320> port<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
CC port but this would actually be the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.539 
CC port but this would actually be the
network<00:01:33.180> address<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.500> your<00:01:34.650> plotter<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
network address of where your plotter is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.830 
network address of where your plotter is
located<00:01:36.420> ok<00:01:36.950> ok<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.820> brings<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.689> we

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
located ok ok this brings up where we

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.350 
located ok ok this brings up where we
want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.229> choose<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.280> software<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
want to choose the software or the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719 
want to choose the software or the
drivers<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.100> important<00:01:44.579> do

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
drivers now this is very important do

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.580 
drivers now this is very important do
not<00:01:44.759> choose<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> drivers<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.170> comes<00:01:46.380> up

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
not choose the drivers that it comes up

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
not choose the drivers that it comes up
with<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.430> believe<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:48.090> want<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
with here I don't believe we want to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.380 
with here I don't believe we want to
choose<00:01:48.689> half<00:01:48.990> disk<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> browse

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
choose half disk and we want to browse

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.910 
choose half disk and we want to browse
and<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.680> we're<00:01:52.860> browsing<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.420> XP

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
and what we're browsing to is the XP

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
64-bit OS installation disk we've had

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.340 
64-bit OS installation disk we've had
that<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.549> our<00:01:59.820> DVD<00:02:00.450> driver<00:02:01.700> drive<00:02:03.049> we<00:02:04.049> want<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that in our DVD driver drive we want to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.430 
that in our DVD driver drive we want to
choose<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> amd64<00:02:07.160> index<00:02:08.450> ok

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
choose the amd64 index ok

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.810 
choose the amd64 index ok
and<00:02:10.650> this<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.130> read<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> drivers

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and this is going to read the drivers

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.420 
and this is going to read the drivers
off<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.560> that's<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.770> day<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> make<00:02:14.190> sure<00:02:14.340> we

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
off of that's the day to make sure we
