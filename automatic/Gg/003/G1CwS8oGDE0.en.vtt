00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

visual<00:00:00.780> approaches<00:00:01.410> need<00:00:01.650> lots<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:02.070> practice

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
visual approaches need lots of practice

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.760 
visual approaches need lots of practice
to<00:00:02.669> get<00:00:02.820> it<00:00:02.939> right<00:00:02.970> let<00:00:03.959> me<00:00:04.020> help<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.529> bit<00:00:04.740> by

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
to get it right let me help you bit by

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.769 
to get it right let me help you bit by
teaching<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.790> line<00:00:06.150> up<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
teaching you how to line up with the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:19.650 
teaching you how to line up with the
runway

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.599 

even<00:00:20.560> though<00:00:20.710> I've<00:00:20.859> made<00:00:20.890> a<00:00:21.130> video<00:00:21.339> about

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
even though I've made a video about

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.330 
even though I've made a video about
visual<00:00:22.210> approaches<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:23.050> realize<00:00:23.919> that<00:00:23.949> I've

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
visual approaches I realize that I've

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.339 
visual approaches I realize that I've
never<00:00:24.609> really<00:00:24.939> explained<00:00:25.539> how<00:00:25.750> to<00:00:25.779> align<00:00:26.289> a

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
never really explained how to align a

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.549 
never really explained how to align a
plane<00:00:26.679> with<00:00:27.039> a<00:00:27.070> runway<00:00:27.400> 4<00:00:27.789> approach<00:00:28.559> this

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:29.559 
plane with a runway 4 approach this

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.560 
plane with a runway 4 approach this
technique<00:00:30.039> is<00:00:30.189> basically<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.849> same<00:00:31.119> for<00:00:31.180> a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
technique is basically the same for a

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.840 
technique is basically the same for a
small<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.050> big<00:00:32.230> aircraft<00:00:32.519> but<00:00:33.519> I'd<00:00:33.670> recommend

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
small and big aircraft but I'd recommend

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.030 
small and big aircraft but I'd recommend
practicing<00:00:34.840> this<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.199> a<00:00:35.320> small<00:00:35.590> plane<00:00:35.829> like

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
practicing this in a small plane like

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.280 
practicing this in a small plane like
this<00:00:36.309> because<00:00:37.059> it's<00:00:37.239> lighter<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.870> therefore

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
this because it's lighter and therefore

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.130 
this because it's lighter and therefore
easier<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.860> handle<00:00:39.449> let's<00:00:40.449> say<00:00:40.659> we're<00:00:40.900> flying

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
easier to handle let's say we're flying

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.860 
easier to handle let's say we're flying
over<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.710> airport<00:00:42.190> we'd<00:00:42.430> like<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.790> land<00:00:42.970> at<00:00:43.180> we

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
over the airport we'd like to land at we

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.259 
over the airport we'd like to land at we
also<00:00:44.079> know<00:00:44.409> that<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:45.250> case<00:00:45.519> we'd<00:00:45.940> like<00:00:46.120> to

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
also know that in this case we'd like to

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.259 
also know that in this case we'd like to
land<00:00:46.479> at<00:00:46.720> runway<00:00:46.750> 2<00:00:47.379> 8<00:00:47.620> which<00:00:48.460> goes<00:00:48.760> from<00:00:49.059> east

turning<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.439> east<00:00:59.769> this<00:01:00.100> means<00:01:00.909> we're<00:01:01.150> going

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
turning to east this means we're going

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.689 
turning to east this means we're going

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
be landing this is called flying

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.170 
be landing this is called flying
downwind<00:01:08.020> as<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:09.130> wind<00:01:09.340> will<00:01:09.670> typically<00:01:10.060> be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
downwind as the wind will typically be

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.719 
downwind as the wind will typically be
coming<00:01:10.600> from<00:01:10.780> behind<00:01:10.960> as<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:12.159> landing<00:01:12.490> should

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
coming from behind as the landing should

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.030 
coming from behind as the landing should
be<00:01:12.939> against<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.570> wind

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
be against the wind

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.039 
be against the wind
we'll<00:01:15.040> continue<00:01:15.220> flying<00:01:15.820> this<00:01:16.180> heading<00:01:16.570> until

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
we'll continue flying this heading until

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.260 
we'll continue flying this heading until
it<00:01:17.200> looks<00:01:17.470> like<00:01:17.560> we'll<00:01:17.979> have<00:01:18.130> enough<00:01:18.460> time<00:01:18.729> to

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
it looks like we'll have enough time to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.050 
it looks like we'll have enough time to
make<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.479> full<00:01:19.840> 180<00:01:20.290> degree<00:01:20.890> turn<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.790> left

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
make a full 180 degree turn to the left

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.190 
make a full 180 degree turn to the left
to<00:01:22.420> line<00:01:22.630> up<00:01:22.810> with<00:01:22.840> runway<00:01:23.409> 2<00:01:23.470> 8

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.290 

during<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> downwind<00:01:28.860> flight<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.060> slow

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
during the downwind flight you can slow

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.360 
during the downwind flight you can slow
down<00:01:30.330> your<00:01:30.540> plane<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.710> above<00:01:32.010> approach

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
down your plane to just above approach

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.800 
down your plane to just above approach
beat<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.330> needed<00:01:33.570> add<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.320> flaps<00:01:35.810> at

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
beat and if needed add some flaps at

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
beat and if needed add some flaps at
this<00:01:37.140> point<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.620> think<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.340> start<00:01:38.460> making

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this point I think we could start making

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600 
this point I think we could start making
the<00:01:39.240> turn<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> left<00:01:40.100> we're<00:01:41.100> still<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the turn to the left we're still up a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
the turn to the left we're still up a
bit<00:01:41.790> high<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.660> four<00:01:42.930> white<00:01:43.200> lights<00:01:43.530> next<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
bit high as to four white lights next to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.240 
bit high as to four white lights next to
the<00:01:44.220> runway<00:01:44.340> indicate<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the runway indicate but because this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
the runway indicate but because this
plane<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.729> rather<00:01:48.000> small<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.690> easily

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
plane is rather small and easily

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
plane is rather small and easily
maneuverable<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.130> short<00:01:50.790> final<00:01:51.030> should<00:01:51.450> be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
maneuverable a short final should be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.100 
maneuverable a short final should be
fine

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
fine

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.160 
fine
also<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> small<00:01:53.760> plane<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.360> find<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
also with a small plane I find it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.080 
also with a small plane I find it's
better<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.650> come<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.460> high<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
better to come in a little high than a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.810 
better to come in a little high than a
little<00:01:57.479> too<00:01:57.630> low<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.160> our<00:01:59.310> plane<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
little too low so as our plane is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.350 
little too low so as our plane is
turning

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
turning

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.900 
turning
we're<00:02:00.869> also<00:02:01.350> reducing<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> speed<00:02:02.340> more<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
we're also reducing the speed more and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.180 
we're also reducing the speed more and
adding<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.600> flaps<00:02:03.960> while<00:02:04.500> keeping<00:02:04.920> an<00:02:05.040> eye

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
adding more flaps while keeping an eye

alignment is not important with an

alignment is not important with an
airliner<00:02:11.340> though<00:02:11.670> I'd<00:02:12.209> recommend<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.959> be

now as the runway is quite straight
ahead<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.510> us<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.710> start<00:02:27.920> aligned<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
ahead of us we can start aligned the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.210 
ahead of us we can start aligned the
plane<00:02:28.700> better<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.900> goal<00:02:30.140> now<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.860> make<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.710 
center line of the runway appear to be
straight<00:02:33.500> up<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.880> might<00:02:35.300> not<00:02:35.330> make<00:02:35.660> sense

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
straight up this might not make sense

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.250 
straight up this might not make sense
but<00:02:36.320> try<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.800> visualize<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:38.480> perfect<00:02:38.930> line<00:02:39.110> up

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
but try to visualize the perfect line up

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.740 
but try to visualize the perfect line up
would<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:39.500> like<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.240> from<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.450> perspective

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
would be like this from this perspective

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.350 
would be like this from this perspective
the<00:02:42.290> center<00:02:43.040> line<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.340> straight<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
the center line is straight but the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.240 
the center line is straight but the
other<00:02:44.510> two<00:02:44.810> lines<00:02:45.050> are<00:02:45.230> angled<00:02:45.680> towards<00:02:46.040> each

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
other two lines are angled towards each

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.360 
other two lines are angled towards each
other<00:02:46.490> into<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.210> distance<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.070> runway

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
other into the distance so if the runway

other into the distance so if the runway
looks<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:51.140> means<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.560> should<00:02:51.650> fly

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
looks like this it means you should fly

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.850 
looks like this it means you should fly
bit<00:02:52.340> more<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.850> left<00:02:53.200> if<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.470> looks<00:02:54.650> like

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
bit more to the left if it looks like

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.770 
bit more to the left if it looks like
this<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.580> should<00:02:55.760> fly<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> bit<00:02:56.270> more<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
this you should fly a bit more to the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.710 
this you should fly a bit more to the
right<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> good<00:02:58.940> idea<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.510> keep

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
right it's not a good idea to keep

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.500 
right it's not a good idea to keep
flying<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.850> sure<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.150> could<00:03:02.360> probably

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
flying like this sure you could probably

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.990 
flying like this sure you could probably
touch<00:03:03.020> down<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.710> after<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.310> threshold<00:03:04.820> and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
touch down just after the threshold and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.510 
touch down just after the threshold and
on<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.630> centreline<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.890> because<00:03:07.340> you've

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
on the centreline but because you've

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.520 
on the centreline but because you've
been<00:03:07.700> flying<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.270> an<00:03:08.420> angle<00:03:08.780> relative<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.260> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.320 
been flying at an angle relative to the
runway<00:03:09.890> you'll<00:03:10.340> need<00:03:10.580> some<00:03:10.790> heavy<00:03:10.970> rudder

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330

much<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.150> crosswind<00:03:14.750> landing<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.900> try<00:03:18.200> to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
much like a crosswind landing so try to

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.870 
much like a crosswind landing so try to
keep<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.740> runway<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.130> look<00:03:19.490> like<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
keep the runway to look like the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.210 
keep the runway to look like the
centreline<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.600> pointing<00:03:21.080> straight<00:03:21.290> up<00:03:21.530> for

that's<00:03:36.470> partly<00:03:36.950> thanks<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.670> crosswinds

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
such a big deal though unless you're

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.830 
such a big deal though unless you're
flying<00:03:51.380> an<00:03:51.650> a380<00:03:52.190> or<00:03:52.700> if<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.330> runway<00:03:53.660> is

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
flying an a380 or if the runway is

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.949 
flying an a380 or if the runway is
extremely<00:03:54.470> narrow

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.780 

even<00:04:01.680> though<00:04:01.829> these<00:04:02.040> techniques<00:04:02.549> are

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
even though these techniques are

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.209 
even though these techniques are
basically<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.450> same<00:04:03.480> for<00:04:03.930> big<00:04:04.079> planes<00:04:04.379> if

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
basically the same for big planes if

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.770 
basically the same for big planes if
you're<00:04:05.459> going<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.790> practice<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.359> for<00:04:06.420> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
you're going to practice this for the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.170 
you're going to practice this for the
first<00:04:06.989> time<00:04:07.349> I'd<00:04:07.620> recommend<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:08.730> take<00:04:08.969> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180
