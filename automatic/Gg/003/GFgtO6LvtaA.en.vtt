00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
screws here they're ten millimeter

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.139 
screws here they're ten millimeter
sockets<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.370> put<00:00:35.520> them<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.000> already

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
sockets you can put them out I already

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.020 
sockets you can put them out I already
took<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.840> left<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> boost<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:38.030> make

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
took it out they left a boost to make

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.049 
took it out they left a boost to make
the<00:00:39.149> video<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.510> faster<00:00:39.960> these<00:00:40.680> two<00:00:40.950> spots<00:00:41.670> here

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the video go faster these two spots here

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
the video go faster these two spots here
as<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.170> once<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.070> left<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
whole thing kind of pops out it's just a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.279 
whole thing kind of pops out it's just a
little<00:00:46.200> holder<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.260> what

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
little holder and then you will see what

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
little holder and then you will see what
you'll<00:00:49.500> once<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> pick<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> snap<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you'll once you pick it up and snap it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.130 
you'll once you pick it up and snap it
out<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.660> looks<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:54.140> basically

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.950 
out and see what it looks like basically
to<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:56.030> this<00:00:57.030> snap<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
to see there's this snap in there but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.700 
to see there's this snap in there but
anyway<00:00:58.109> once<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.469> remove<00:00:58.800> that<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> PVC

there the PCV valve is right here and
you<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> clamp<00:01:06.680> something<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you be just going to clamp something to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
you be just going to clamp something to
clamp<00:01:08.010> loosen<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> pull<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.540> back

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
clamp loosen this up and pull it back

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
clamp loosen this up and pull it back
and<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.200> pull<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.460> 22

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and I just pull this out you get 22

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.380 
and I just pull this out you get 22
millimeter<00:01:12.360> socket<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.409> long<00:01:13.710> neck<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
millimeter socket and long neck and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.899 
millimeter socket and long neck and
basically<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> part<00:01:16.020> looks<00:01:16.229> like

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
basically just what the part looks like

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
basically just what the part looks like
inside<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.570> once<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> remove<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
put the new part in torque it down and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
put the new part in torque it down and
put<00:01:24.180> everything<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.350> good<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.619> go

put everything back and you good to go
and<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> color<00:01:27.600> goes<00:01:27.810> back<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.380> see

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.830 

do<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.159> with<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.490> hand

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:02:08.350 

once<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.990> line<00:01:45.229> it<00:01:45.380> up<00:02:06.850> it's<00:02:07.850> kind<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.090> hard<00:02:08.299> to

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
once you line it up it's kind of hard to

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.710 
once you line it up it's kind of hard to
do<00:02:13.180> there<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.209> go

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
do there you go

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.140 
do there you go
