about<00:00:14.080> capsules<00:00:14.919> which<00:00:15.610> are<00:00:15.639> a<00:00:15.999> reason<00:00:16.450> why

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
about capsules which are a reason why

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.390 
about capsules which are a reason why
some<00:00:16.810> people<00:00:16.840> do<00:00:17.230> choose<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.560> have<00:00:17.890> further

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
some people do choose to have further

some people do choose to have further
surgery<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.240> their<00:00:19.420> breast<00:00:19.660> after<00:00:19.900> an<00:00:20.470> implant

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
surgery to their breast after an implant

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.939 
surgery to their breast after an implant
now<00:00:22.179> the<00:00:22.269> first<00:00:22.480> thing<00:00:22.660> what<00:00:23.259> is<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.410> capsule

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
now the first thing what is a capsule

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.880 
now the first thing what is a capsule
the<00:00:24.189> capsule<00:00:24.220> is<00:00:24.939> basically<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:26.259> lining

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
the capsule is basically the lining

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.529 
the capsule is basically the lining
around<00:00:27.009> your<00:00:27.580> breast<00:00:27.789> implant

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
around your breast implant

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.509 
around your breast implant
so<00:00:28.900> whatever<00:00:29.410> type<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.740> implant<00:00:30.189> you<00:00:30.250> have<00:00:30.429> in

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
so whatever type of implant you have in

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.700 
so whatever type of implant you have in
your<00:00:30.609> body<00:00:30.880> your<00:00:31.359> body<00:00:31.570> recognizes<00:00:32.140> it<00:00:32.590> as<00:00:32.680> a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
your body your body recognizes it as a

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.770 
your body your body recognizes it as a
foreign<00:00:33.100> material<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.880> tries<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.120> wall<00:00:34.510> it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
foreign material and tries to wall it

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.170 
foreign material and tries to wall it
off<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.469> into<00:00:35.590> that<00:00:35.800> wall<00:00:36.250> which<00:00:36.910> is<00:00:36.940> the

off and into that wall which is the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.900 
off and into that wall which is the
capsule<00:00:37.629> so<00:00:38.140> this<00:00:38.260> can<00:00:38.440> occur<00:00:38.680> over<00:00:38.890> with<00:00:39.730> any

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
capsule so this can occur over with any

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.450 
capsule so this can occur over with any
implantable<00:00:40.629> device<00:00:41.079> heart<00:00:41.710> valves<00:00:42.309> hip

supple and walls off the implant but you

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.529 
supple and walls off the implant but you
really<00:00:53.590> wouldn't<00:00:53.829> know<00:00:53.890> it's<00:00:54.160> there<00:00:54.539> however

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
really wouldn't know it's there however

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.840 
really wouldn't know it's there however
in<00:00:55.960> some<00:00:56.350> people<00:00:56.859> this<00:00:57.010> capsule<00:00:57.489> becomes

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
in some people this capsule becomes

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.020 
in some people this capsule becomes
thicker<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.570> firmer<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.890> we<00:01:00.519> don't<00:01:00.789> really

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
thicker and firmer and we don't really

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.509 
thicker and firmer and we don't really
know<00:01:01.269> why<00:01:01.449> this<00:01:01.510> occurs<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:03.039> reason<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.370> use

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
know why this occurs the reason we use

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.490 
know why this occurs the reason we use

are also other types of implants are

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.170 
are also other types of implants are
just<00:01:13.960> polyurethane<00:01:14.770> implants<00:01:15.250> which<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.060> can

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
just polyurethane implants which you can

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.510 
just polyurethane implants which you can

from<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.119> from<00:01:19.630> Australia<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.290> one<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.770> our

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
from the from Australia in one of our

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.200 
from the from Australia in one of our
podcasts<00:01:21.490> which<00:01:21.610> have<00:01:21.759> later<00:01:21.970> on<00:01:22.090> the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
podcasts which have later on the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.330 
podcasts which have later on the
websites<00:01:22.630> which<00:01:23.229> have<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.409> very<00:01:23.590> very<00:01:23.860> low<00:01:24.100> rate

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
websites which have a very very low rate

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.060 
websites which have a very very low rate
of<00:01:24.369> capsular<00:01:24.790> contracture<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:26.049> we<00:01:26.799> don't<00:01:26.950> know

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
of capsular contracture so we don't know

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.490 
of capsular contracture so we don't know
why<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.310> occurs<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:28.210> may<00:01:28.450> occur<00:01:28.750> due<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.170> very

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
why it occurs it may occur due to very

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.560 
why it occurs it may occur due to very
low-grade<00:01:29.770> inflammation<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:31.240> certainly

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
low-grade inflammation and certainly

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.480 
low-grade inflammation and certainly
I've<00:01:31.899> had<00:01:32.079> patients<00:01:32.320> years<00:01:32.829> after<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.250> breast

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
I've had patients years after a breast

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.490 
I've had patients years after a breast
enlargement<00:01:34.180> who<00:01:34.600> have<00:01:34.810> developed<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.290> tooth

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
enlargement who have developed a tooth

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.980 
enlargement who have developed a tooth
infection<00:01:35.710> who<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:37.240> developed<00:01:37.600> capsules

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
infection who have developed capsules

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.780 
infection who have developed capsules
which<00:01:38.170> they<00:01:38.409> say<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:39.250> know<00:01:39.369> appear

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
which they say you know appear

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.840 
which they say you know appear
approximately<00:01:40.509> at<00:01:40.869> that<00:01:40.960> time<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.159> some

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
approximately at that time so some

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.420 
approximately at that time so some
people<00:01:42.970> get<00:01:43.180> capsules<00:01:43.689> about<00:01:44.170> 5%<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:45.009> people

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
people get capsules about 5% of people

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.709 
people get capsules about 5% of people
get<00:01:46.210> capsules<00:01:46.689> which<00:01:47.020> are<00:01:47.200> bad<00:01:47.560> enough<00:01:47.890> to

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
get capsules which are bad enough to

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.530 
get capsules which are bad enough to
cause<00:01:49.719> them<00:01:49.990> concern<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.909> capsule<00:01:52.329> does

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
cause them concern what the capsule does

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.410 
cause them concern what the capsule does
is<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.229> acts<00:01:53.469> like<00:01:53.619> shrink<00:01:54.310> wrap<00:01:54.610> around<00:01:55.240> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
is it acts like shrink wrap around the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.050 
is it acts like shrink wrap around the
implant<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.619> contracts<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.930> pulls<00:01:58.930> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
implant so it contracts and pulls in

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
straight to the capsules but they may

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
to make the breast implant feel firmer

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.270 
to make the breast implant feel firmer

if the capsules progress they can cause

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.590 
if the capsules progress they can cause

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
your bust so if you do develop capsules

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.500 
your bust so if you do develop capsules
you're<00:02:27.100> probably<00:02:27.490> realized<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.390> know<00:02:28.480> that

you're probably realized you know that

you're probably realized you know that

that does occur you know really it would

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.670 
discuss the options available for you
and<00:02:45.370> these<00:02:45.580> essentially<00:02:46.210> either<00:02:47.080> involved

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
and these essentially either involved

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.760 
and these essentially either involved
capsulotomy<00:02:48.750> which<00:02:49.750> means<00:02:49.990> internal

division of the capsules or capsule
ectomy<00:02:54.010> which<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.240> medical<00:02:56.110> word<00:02:56.500> for

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.670 
ectomy which is the medical word for
removal<00:02:57.460> so<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.200> capsules<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.320> either<00:02:59.440> be

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
new implant replaced in the position so

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.560 
new implant replaced in the position so

capsules in summary are rare they can

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.680 
capsules in summary are rare they can

they do occur you either need to

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.540 
they do occur you either need to
