the<00:02:50.100> animation<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.670> pretty<00:02:50.910> solid<00:02:51.090> back<00:02:51.450> in

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.930 

it's<00:03:06.860> how<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.980> say<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:09.600> clean<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.940> just

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
there but the animation just seems a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.640 
there but the animation just seems a
little<00:03:17.700> off<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.360> me<00:03:18.540> when<00:03:19.050> compared<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
little off to me when compared to the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.070 
little off to me when compared to the
