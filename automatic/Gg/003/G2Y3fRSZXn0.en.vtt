that<00:00:34.100> none<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.310> them<00:00:34.490> fall<00:00:34.730> back<00:00:34.970> into<00:00:35.210> the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
that none of them fall back into the

that none of them fall back into the
main<00:00:35.690> bowl<00:00:35.930> I<00:00:36.940> end<00:00:37.940> up<00:00:38.030> using<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.570> mayonnaise

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
main bowl I end up using a mayonnaise

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.560 
main bowl I end up using a mayonnaise
jar<00:00:39.290> because<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:40.490> gives<00:00:40.730> me<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.970> nice<00:00:41.180> tight

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
jar because it gives me a nice tight

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.360 
jar because it gives me a nice tight
seal<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.080> it's<00:00:42.200> proximately<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.040> correct

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
seal and it's proximately the correct

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.460 
seal and it's proximately the correct
height<00:00:43.870> only<00:00:44.870> thing<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:45.200> would<00:00:45.260> make<00:00:45.320> this

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
height only thing that would make this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.260 
height only thing that would make this
more<00:00:45.770> perfect<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:46.310> if<00:00:46.490> this<00:00:46.730> was<00:00:46.910> made<00:00:47.090> out<00:00:47.120> of

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
more perfect as if this was made out of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.230 
more perfect as if this was made out of
some<00:00:47.510> type<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.810> non-breakable<00:00:48.710> material<00:00:49.430> but

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
some type of non-breakable material but

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.300 
some type of non-breakable material but
I've<00:00:50.570> had<00:00:50.780> these<00:00:50.990> mason<00:00:51.410> jars<00:00:51.650> for<00:00:51.890> several

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
I've had these mason jars for several

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.620 
I've had these mason jars for several
years<00:00:52.580> and<00:00:52.760> I<00:00:52.820> guess<00:00:53.030> they're<00:00:53.240> working<00:00:53.510> out

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
years and I guess they're working out

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.780 
years and I guess they're working out
just<00:00:53.660> fine<00:00:53.960> okay<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:56.980> use<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.010> pair<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.370> a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
just fine okay I use a pair of a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.590 
just fine okay I use a pair of a
gigantic<00:00:59.600> scissors<00:00:59.990> to<00:01:00.500> cut<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:00.890> with<00:01:01.600> will

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
gigantic scissors to cut this with will

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.329 
gigantic scissors to cut this with will
generally<00:01:03.050> clean<00:01:03.320> these<00:01:03.650> up<00:01:03.710> just<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.189> little

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
generally clean these up just a little

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.200 
generally clean these up just a little
bit<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:06.039> my<00:01:07.039> pieces<00:01:07.429> of<00:01:07.700> solder<00:01:07.969> will

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
bit and my pieces of solder will

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.870 
bit and my pieces of solder will
actually<00:01:08.630> be<00:01:08.840> about<00:01:09.289> a<00:01:09.320> sixteenth<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.670> eight

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
actually be about a sixteenth by eight

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.249 
actually be about a sixteenth by eight
to<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.149> niche<00:01:11.299> for<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:12.020> type<00:01:12.229> of

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
to the niche for this type of

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:26.720 
to the niche for this type of
application

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.980 

now<00:01:27.730> I've<00:01:27.790> got<00:01:27.970> five<00:01:28.210> pieces<00:01:28.510> so<00:01:28.840> I'll<00:01:28.960> just

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
now I've got five pieces so I'll just

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:40.630 
now I've got five pieces so I'll just
cut<00:01:29.440> five<00:01:31.080> pieces<00:01:32.080> of<00:01:32.260> sore

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.460 

you<00:01:41.640> could<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.060> snips<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.540> cut<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.260> just

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you could use snips to cut these so just

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740 
you could use snips to cut these so just
scissors<00:01:43.950> work<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.580> better<00:01:44.820> one

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
scissors work a little bit better one

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
scissors work a little bit better one
thing<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.110> important<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.920> starter

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thing that is important on your starter

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.630 
thing that is important on your starter
is<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.870> it's<00:01:49.020> readable<00:01:49.620> but<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
is I don't know if it's readable but it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600 
is I don't know if it's readable but it
has<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> letters<00:01:51.270> easy<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.460> keep<00:01:53.460> my

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
has the letters easy on here I keep my

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.720 
has the letters easy on here I keep my
solder<00:01:53.880> segregated<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.780> keep<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.230> marked

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
solder segregated I keep the marked

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.470 
solder segregated I keep the marked
because<00:01:56.730> the<00:01:57.860> silver<00:01:58.860> solder<00:01:59.160> looks<00:02:00.150> just

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
because the silver solder looks just

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.170 
because the silver solder looks just
like<00:02:00.660> silver<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.490> wouldn't<00:02:02.760> want<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:02.970> try

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
like silver and you wouldn't want to try

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.020 
like silver and you wouldn't want to try
to<00:02:03.860> try<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> salt<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.400> something<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> piece

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
to try to salt or something with a piece

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.790 
to try to salt or something with a piece
of<00:02:06.060> silver<00:02:06.570> sterling<00:02:07.140> silver<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.650> you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
of silver sterling silver and you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.859 
of silver sterling silver and you
wouldn't<00:02:08.100> want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> try<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> solder<00:02:09.420> something

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
wouldn't want to try to solder something

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.420 
wouldn't want to try to solder something
on<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.170> solder<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> would<00:02:11.010> melt<00:02:11.220> into

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
on to solder because it would melt into

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760 
on to solder because it would melt into
a<00:02:11.580> big<00:02:11.790> giant<00:02:11.970> bone<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.570> important<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.290> keep

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
a big giant bone it is important to keep

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.310 
a big giant bone it is important to keep
ahead<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.670> spotter<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> where

ahead of your spotter what it is where

ahead of your spotter what it is where
it<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.790> how<00:02:17.790> much<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.360> those<00:02:19.020> kind<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
it is how much you have those kind of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.320 
it is how much you have those kind of
things<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.400> will<00:02:20.580> find<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.060> little<00:02:21.180> bit

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
things you will find that a little bit

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.360 
things you will find that a little bit
of<00:02:21.450> solder<00:02:21.630> goes<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> very<00:02:22.050> long<00:02:22.260> way<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
of solder goes a very long way so you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.870 
of solder goes a very long way so you
won't<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> purchase<00:02:24.000> very<00:02:24.390> much<00:02:25.910> ok<00:02:28.880> take

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
won't have to purchase very much ok take

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.590 
won't have to purchase very much ok take
basically<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.420> paintbrush<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:32.390> as<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.510> can

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
basically a paintbrush and as you can

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.000 
basically a paintbrush and as you can
see<00:02:33.660> there's<00:02:33.900> some<00:02:33.960> water<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
see there's some water in here and the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.560 
see there's some water in here and the
rest<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> flux<00:02:35.640> I'll<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.030> grab<00:02:36.180> some<00:02:36.540> of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
rest of the flux I'll just grab some of

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.530 
rest of the flux I'll just grab some of
this<00:02:36.690> looks<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.670> football<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.420> I'm

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
this looks like a football and what I'm

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.440 
this looks like a football and what I'm
going<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.140> I'm<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.650> coat<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
going to do is I'm going to coat all the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.640 
going to do is I'm going to coat all the
pieces<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.989> salt<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.860> slaughter<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.650> make

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
pieces of salt of a slaughter and make

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.930 
pieces of salt of a slaughter and make
sure<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:48.920> coating<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.190> this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
sure that they have a coating of this

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.729 
sure that they have a coating of this
flux<00:02:51.300> I'm<00:02:51.900> front<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.470> back<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.530> isn't

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
flux I'm front and back and it isn't

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.690 
flux I'm front and back and it isn't
basically<00:02:56.400> being<00:02:56.610> kind<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.120> making<00:02:57.450> luck

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
basically being kind of like making luck

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.810 
basically being kind of like making luck
and<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.350> sense<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:01.800> what<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.370> this

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
and in a sense that's what this is this

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.840 
and in a sense that's what this is this
is<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> type<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.360> fan<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:05.160> when<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.520> put<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
is a type of fan that when you put the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.180 
is a type of fan that when you put the
heat<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.420> melts<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.800> glass<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.520 

that's<00:03:14.190> what<00:03:14.430> doesn't<00:03:15.209> allow<00:03:15.540> oxygen<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.380> get

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
that's what doesn't allow oxygen to get

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.410 
that's what doesn't allow oxygen to get
to<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.830> metal<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.370> being<00:03:17.640> heated<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:20.420> don't

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
to the metal and is being heated I don't

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.410 
to the metal and is being heated I don't
know<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.440> I've<00:03:23.010> got

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
know if you can see that but I've got

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.240 
know if you can see that but I've got
all<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.600> with<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> starter<00:03:25.230> now<00:03:25.410> covered

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
all the with the starter now covered

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.940 
all the with the starter now covered
with<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> sandy<00:03:28.019> mud<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.459> flux
