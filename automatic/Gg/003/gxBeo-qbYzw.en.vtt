 South Stream project except Italy France 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:03.850
 can connect other European 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.779
 the partners were informed by the prime minister 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.430
 Russian Minister Vladimir Putin on

 Bulgaria negotiations sitting down today was

 construction agreement signed 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.260
 Bulgarian gas pipeline section 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.740
 russian prime minister especially 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.970
 singled out therefore the project is not about 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.390
 compromise about mutual benefit almost 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.010
 two and a half billion euros will be 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.750
 getting Bulgaria but through her 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.789
 pipeline will pass 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.599
 from Russia, Vladimir Putin will bring in 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.380
 Moscow is not only signed contracts 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320
 but also small representatives

 More recently, Bulgaria called 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.100
 the stumbling block to the south stream 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.809
 and now the authors speak as images 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 gas pipeline ideas cleared the way 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.530
 today's working visit to Vladimir 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.159
 Putin's Sofia is essentially the last step 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.870
 before the start of the practical 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.089
 project implementation 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.730
 Bulgarian government approved 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.829
 creation of a joint venture with Russia 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.920
 for construction on its territory 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.950
 South Stream Pipeline Parts 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.060
 two days ago 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.260
 signing of documents 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.200

 briskly Borisov according to Vladimir 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.250
 Putin's from the implementation of this project 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.570
 Balkaria itself will win in other 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.260
 European countries want to emphasize 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.970
 the great importance of the gas pipeline southern 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.549

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.570

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.460
 in pan-European significance 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.480

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.220
 as a result, the amount that 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 has arisen 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.080
 in the ratio of the main transit 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.530
 country from Ukraine 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.870

 the southern part 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.830
 through the pipeline south stream and gas from Russia 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.970
 bypassing the transit countries go 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.320
 through Bulgaria in two directions on 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.960

 Black Sea is now building 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.410
 gas pipeline may already start in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.850
 the near future and the south stream 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.610
 must be entered no later than 2015 also 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.440

 changes in bulgaria in the past 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.040
 year because of the refusal of the investor to participate 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.470
 in the project immediately after that russia announced 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.660
 about readiness paid video not

 the project 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.639
 the thing is, we want to approach this 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.699
 the issue has been paid 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.389
