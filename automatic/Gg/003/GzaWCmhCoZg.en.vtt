was messing around with a couple

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.419 
was messing around with a couple
different<00:00:22.789> substrates<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.830> I<00:00:24.830> just<00:00:25.009> ended<00:00:25.310> up

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
different substrates and I just ended up

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.370 
different substrates and I just ended up
getting<00:00:25.759> mixed<00:00:26.000> up<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:26.509> what<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:26.689> did<00:00:26.810> is<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:27.170> cut

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.640 
getting mixed up so what I did is I cut
some<00:00:27.589> plexiglass<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:28.839> silicone<00:00:29.839> in<00:00:30.169> place

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
some plexiglass and silicone in place

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.319 
some plexiglass and silicone in place

here in front of the aquarium about a
third<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.110> distance<00:00:36.559> front<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.670> back<00:00:38.110> this

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
third of the distance front to back this

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.520 
third of the distance front to back this
is<00:00:39.379> gonna<00:00:39.710> be<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.640> sand<00:00:41.270> area<00:00:41.570> up<00:00:41.960> in<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.199> front

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
is gonna be a sand area up in the front

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.360 
is gonna be a sand area up in the front
of<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.710> tank<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.410> sand<00:00:45.410> will<00:00:45.620> stay<00:00:45.980> there

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
of the tank and the sand will stay there

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.959 
of the tank and the sand will stay there
and<00:00:46.699> not<00:00:46.910> intermingle<00:00:47.449> with<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.870> rest<00:00:48.079> of<00:00:48.260> the

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
and not intermingle with the rest of the

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.880 
and not intermingle with the rest of the
substrate<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.570> what<00:00:50.780> I'm<00:00:50.870> going<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.050> do<00:00:51.410> is

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
substrate and what I'm going to do is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.119 
substrate and what I'm going to do is
somehow<00:00:52.699> i<00:00:53.480> don't<00:00:53.960> quite<00:00:54.230> figured<00:00:54.710> out<00:00:54.859> yet

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
somehow i don't quite figured out yet

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.900 
somehow i don't quite figured out yet
how<00:00:55.329> but<00:00:56.329> i'm<00:00:56.449> going<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.690> incorporate<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.910> rock

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
how but i'm going to incorporate a rock

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.420 
how but i'm going to incorporate a rock
in<00:00:59.300> here<00:01:00.370> with<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.739> then<00:01:03.739> I<00:01:03.859> got<00:01:04.070> another

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
in here with this and then I got another

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.859 
in here with this and then I got another
piece<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:05.000> plexiglass<00:01:05.810> that's<00:01:06.260> somehow<00:01:07.869> gonna

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
piece of plexiglass that's somehow gonna

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.719 
piece of plexiglass that's somehow gonna
get<00:01:09.229> in<00:01:09.409> there<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.189> Rock<00:01:10.430> will<00:01:10.460> be

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
get in there so the Rock will be

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.490 
get in there so the Rock will be
incorporated<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.720> when<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:11.960> all<00:01:12.110> said<00:01:12.470> and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
incorporated and when it's all said and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.490 
incorporated and when it's all said and
done<00:01:13.540> you<00:01:14.540> won't<00:01:14.720> be<00:01:14.930> able<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.200> see<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
done you won't be able to see the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.300 
done you won't be able to see the
plexiglass<00:01:16.210> hopefully<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:19.189> that's

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
plexiglass hopefully and so that's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.950 
plexiglass hopefully and so that's
what's<00:01:19.549> up<00:01:19.759> that's<00:01:20.060> what's<00:01:20.270> coming<00:01:20.659> up<00:01:20.750> with<00:01:20.930> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.030 
base and I silicone the mall in and just
to<00:02:26.610> fill<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> sand<00:02:27.870> has<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.590> at

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
to fill it in so the sand has like at

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.150 
to fill it in so the sand has like at
least<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.460> physical<00:02:29.970> barrier<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.260> don't<00:02:31.920> keep

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
least a physical barrier so I don't keep

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.280 
least a physical barrier so I don't keep
you<00:02:32.550> know<00:02:32.700> undermining<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:35.990> put<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> couple

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you know undermining it and put a couple

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
you know undermining it and put a couple
up<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> top<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.250> think<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:38.730> I'm

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
up here on the top I think what I'm

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.240 
up here on the top I think what I'm
going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> get<00:02:39.150> into<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.050> got<00:02:40.950> these<00:02:41.070> little

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
going to get into is I got these little

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.040 
going to get into is I got these little
strips<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.880> driftwood<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:44.780> play<00:02:45.780> around

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
strips of driftwood and I play around

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.040 
strips of driftwood and I play around
with<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.980> somehow<00:02:47.400> kind<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.990> know

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
with it but somehow kind of you know

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.990 
with it but somehow kind of you know
throw<00:02:49.440> them<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.830> there<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.820> kind

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
throw them up in there like that to kind

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.020 
throw them up in there like that to kind
of<00:02:51.810> conceal<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.940> top<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.890> Plexiglas

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
of conceal the the top of the Plexiglas

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.970 
of conceal the the top of the Plexiglas
so<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.360> won't<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.690> as<00:02:57.810> visible<00:02:58.020> once<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
so it won't be as visible once all the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.240 
so it won't be as visible once all the
substrate<00:02:59.520> everything's<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:01.250> that's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
substrate everything's in so that's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.040 
substrate everything's in so that's
where<00:03:02.460> i'm<00:03:02.580> at<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.600> i'll<00:03:03.840> keep

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
where i'm at right now and i'll keep

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.970 
where i'm at right now and i'll keep
this<00:03:04.320> rolling<00:03:04.790> wait<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.380> cleaned<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
this rolling wait so I cleaned up the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.480 
this rolling wait so I cleaned up the
remnants<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.880> silicone<00:03:09.420> um<00:03:10.490> let

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
remnants of the silicone um let

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.120 
remnants of the silicone um let
everything<00:03:11.760> dry<00:03:11.910> overnight<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:13.070> went<00:03:14.070> ahead

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
everything dry overnight and went ahead

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.580 
everything dry overnight and went ahead
and<00:03:14.430> put<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.730> my<00:03:15.030> substrate<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.780> got<00:03:16.410> some

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
and put in my substrate and got some

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.340 
and put in my substrate and got some
water<00:03:16.770> going<00:03:17.150> got<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.420> pop<00:03:18.870> everything

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
water going got the pop everything

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.550 
water going got the pop everything
hooked<00:03:19.470> back<00:03:19.710> up<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:20.400> filter<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.410> might<00:03:22.410> at

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
hooked back up the filter and might at

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.890 
hooked back up the filter and might at
cycle<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.580> see<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:26.630> plexiglass<00:03:27.630> is

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
cycle and you can see the plexiglass is

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.490 
cycle and you can see the plexiglass is
still<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.350> little<00:03:28.800> bit<00:03:29.070> visible<00:03:29.640> um<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:31.380> can

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
still a little bit visible um you can

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.160 
still a little bit visible um you can
see<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.770> big<00:03:31.950> rock<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.700> kind<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.120> mostly<00:03:33.840> gone

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
see the big rock is kind of mostly gone

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.520 
see the big rock is kind of mostly gone
now<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:35.570> what<00:03:36.570> I'm<00:03:36.660> gonna<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.990> is<00:03:37.020> just<00:03:37.350> use

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
now but what I'm gonna do is just use

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.080 
now but what I'm gonna do is just use
some<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.830> these<00:03:37.890> smaller<00:03:38.070> rocks<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.700> conceal

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
some of these smaller rocks to conceal

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.180 
some of these smaller rocks to conceal
it<00:03:39.300> with<00:03:39.690> some<00:03:39.870> driftwood<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.500> plants<00:03:40.980> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
it with some driftwood and plants and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.310 
it with some driftwood and plants and
you<00:03:42.120> won't<00:03:42.330> even<00:03:42.450> be<00:03:42.660> able<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.170> when

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
you won't even be able to see it when

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.770 
you won't even be able to see it when
it's<00:03:43.440> all<00:03:43.590> said<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:43.920> done<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.400> grown<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.850> but

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
it's all said and done and grown in but

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.990 
it's all said and done and grown in but
I<00:03:46.020> think<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.470> gives<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.890> nice<00:03:47.040> look<00:03:47.459> nice

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
I think that gives it a nice look nice

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
I think that gives it a nice look nice
open<00:03:48.450> sandy<00:03:48.930> front<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.880> course<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.720> scapes

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
open sandy front of course the scapes

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.230 
open sandy front of course the scapes
not<00:03:52.260> done<00:03:52.560> there's<00:03:52.830> going<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.100> be<00:03:53.130> rock<00:03:53.790> and

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
not done there's going to be rock and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.000 
not done there's going to be rock and
driftwood<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.520> also<00:03:56.520> plants<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.360> for<00:03:57.900> now<00:03:58.050> my

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
driftwood and also plants but for now my

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.210 
driftwood and also plants but for now my
substrate<00:03:59.670> barrier<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.720> complete<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.410> will

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
substrate barrier is complete and will

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.040 
substrate barrier is complete and will
keep<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.550> video<00:04:02.880> rolling<00:04:03.150> when<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.600> get<00:04:03.810> some

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
keep this video rolling when I get some

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.990 
keep this video rolling when I get some
plants<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.709> their<00:04:05.190> stuff<00:04:05.430> back<00:04:05.490> up<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:05.970> here
