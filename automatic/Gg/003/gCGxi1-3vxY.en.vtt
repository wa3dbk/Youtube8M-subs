00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
focusing more on the pc rather than the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.129 
focusing more on the pc rather than the
DS<00:00:14.280> section<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.089> because<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> d/s<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> much

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
DS section just because the d/s is much

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.330 
DS section just because the d/s is much
easier<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.820> basically<00:00:18.949> anyone<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.160> do

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
easier and it's basically anyone can do

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.400 
easier and it's basically anyone can do
that<00:00:20.369> rather<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> pc<00:00:21.810> version<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.260> much

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that rather but the pc version is much

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.679
