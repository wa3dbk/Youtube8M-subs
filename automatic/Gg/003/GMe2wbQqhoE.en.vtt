00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.290
 let's see how we would give the hardness of 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.090
 the suspension of our vehicle in 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.490
 theory is something simple that you should do 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.620
 the user himself and that the brand us 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.539
 provides again with the motorbike 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.190
 provides a toolkit where 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 There is the necessary tool to 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.180
 vary the hardness of the suspension 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.680
 we will have to vary the hardness when 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.750
 we notice discomfort when it comes to catching 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.910
 a pothole if the suspension is too hard 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.290
 we will give you a very dry blow but for 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.719
 against the wheels for more grab the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.360
 asphalt if we do not want to notice the blow 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.070
 of the pothole we should have the suspension 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.140
 in a softer position so that 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.649
 dampen more but we will lose something of 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.949
 adn 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.179
 let's see how we would think or 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.179
 we would rest the pier 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 inside the next toolkit 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.700
 with the engine we find one that is the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.700
 necessary to vary the hardness 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.590
 in this case 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.580
 in this case this shock absorber has its 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.580
 variation point here 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.220
 and this is where we have the different 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.440
 measures this cushion anchor in this 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.140
 point from here then we have to 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.030
 put it so that if the spring is left 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.530
 more stretched compresses less and if 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.910
 we put in the position that compresses more 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.040
 the pier we are hardening the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.990
 suspension to vary it in this case 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.300
 we anchor this tool and by way of 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.790
 lever we move it to the next 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.820
 position in this case we have put in the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.990
 middle position this has three if 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.990
 it varies until the next 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.670
 now what is the lowest position 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.290
 we would have put in the most position 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.180
 soft on the other side we'll have to 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.009
 always put the same position if not the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.590
 motorbike will work unbalanced and 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.460
 we would notice irregularities at the time of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.460
 work in curve 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.430
