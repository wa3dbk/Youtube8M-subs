00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:04.714
 When Bobby Orr came to Boston 

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:10.244
 They lost the playoffs ... some 6 consecutive years 

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:14.099
 The first year that Bobby Orr played for Bruins 

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:15.925
 They lost that year too 

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:18.408
 but they seemed better 

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:19.985
 Because Bobby Orr was there. 

00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:22.905
 He made the Bruins go around 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.566
 and in the next years when Esposito joined the team 

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:30.920
 That's what made the Bruins go around completely 

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:35.228
 With a little more they became a threat in the dispute of the Stanley Cup 

00:00:35.263 --> 00:00:37.300
 Bruins improved 

00:00:38.764 --> 00:00:42.947
 and in his third season, with 21 goals 

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.221
 The following year he managed 33 

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:47.679
 and in the next, 37 

00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:51.189
 He really invaded the opponent's defense 

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:57.704
 But he would never be a quarterback with that great attacking ability he had 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.211
 And he was also a great skater, and so fast !! 

00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:05.870
 He could overtake anyone in our team. 

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:11.251
 I remember several times I was on the "Red Line" in front of him and before I got to the "Blue Line" he had already passed me 

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:20.224
 I have never seen anyone who in such a short time was reaching such a great speed 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.110
 Many guys can skate well 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.186
 But it did not explode the way it happened to him 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.475
 There were other Runners 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.785
 But none dominated, behind his goal 

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:38.988
 and it was making its way, as Bobby Orr did. 

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:46.431
 He started the play and in most cases that play ended. 

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:50.435
 Many consecutive seasons, Bobby Orr was the winner of the Norris Trophy 

00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:52.510
 As the top defender of the league 

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.204
 With this impressive ability to skate and protect the puck 

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.453
 The Bruins' attack was almost impossible to contain 

00:01:59.488 --> 00:02:03.426
 He passed the "Blue Line" and simply exploded in the "Neutral Zone" 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:11.118
 And he had Cashman here, Hodge there, and Esposito going there, Dallas Smith coming back on that side 

00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:17.811
 Orr loading and all he had to do is swap pass and go back to him to give him options 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.829
 Possibly Attack like that never had 

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:25.148
 He passed the first mark so easily 

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.210
 and the whole defense was breaking 

00:02:27.493 --> 00:02:28.849
 and he had all the space to play 

00:02:29.373 --> 00:02:33.488
 the forwards came after him 

00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:37.138
 he got rid of the pressure with a great speed 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.189
 I almost could not defend 

00:02:41.648 --> 00:02:42.694
 You always had to be worried. 

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:43.974
 Why did he lead the race? 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.255
 He was the guy who could change everything. 

00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:50.167
 He had 3 races without tiring 

00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:53.307
 his ability to skate was incredible 

00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:56.035
 Offensively, Defensively 

00:02:57.918 --> 00:02:59.771
 No one controlled the game, as Bobby Orr controlled 

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:06.256
 Bobby Orr did the opposite by playing. Your style, your weight. 

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.175
 It was not to play like that, but he played like that. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.868
 Control the game. 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.445
 Every onslaught on the ice he controlled the game 

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:17.709
 I never forgot 

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:21.448
 Bobby was killing the Pk and got the puck and went behind the goal 

00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:22.773
 I was standing in front of 

00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:25.499
 I looked over my shoulder. 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.360
 My team player on one side and another 

00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:29.482
 I thought now I'll get it. 

00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:32.062
 I went behind the goal he came forward 

00:03:32.527 --> 00:03:34.732
 I went back to the front of the net he went back 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.230
 And I wondering what I'm going to do? 

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:37.240
 So I tried again 

00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:39.147
 and he did the same thing 

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:44.024
 and the crowd ended up in the Boston Garden, and everyone laughing 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:51.237
 I went to the bank talking "Get me out of here I do not know what I do" 

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.728
 All the players in the bank were laughing 

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.885
 Then the technician had to ask TimeOut 

00:04:09.763 --> 00:04:14.727
 In 1970, Bobby Orr became the first defensive to be able to make more goals than the others 

00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:18.588
 Led the Bruins to win 1st Stanley Cup in 29 years 

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:22.339
 and awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, as Playoff MVP 

00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:24.607
 or Simply the Best 

00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:31.102
 Someone once wrote that a defensive player with an award for having scored more goals than the others 

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:38.042
 would be like a pitcher leading the league, in baseball, in Home Runs 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.458
 and the fact that he led the attack, ended the attack and simply be an attacker 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.390
 and take control leading the attack 

00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:53.901
 I can remember so many games that everything I had to do 

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:56.618
 was to put me in front of the goal and wait 

00:04:56.653 --> 00:05:01.352
 and he would circulate and make the necessary turns, but he found me 

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.247
 and gave me practically with an open goal 

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:05.849
 That's one of the reasons I scored so many goals. 

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:07.392
 It was because of Bobby Orr. 

00:05:09.283 --> 00:05:11.838
 I had the ability to read Bobby Orr 

00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:14.285
 I knew where he was going to stop. 

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:17.034
 Where would he go? 

00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:23.037
 And I knew that sooner or later he would give me the puck to score, because he was good that way 

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:26.501
 So I worried about positioning myself 

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:29.820
 and Bobby if he was very marked he would send me the puck 

00:05:30.732 --> 00:05:33.973
 He to me was the biggest defender to have played this game 

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:40.683
 In 1972, the excellent performance of Orr took the Bruins to another Stanley Cup 

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:47.019
 With so many points and records, his defensive trait was never hampered 

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:52.145
 Some people argued, that he had such an offensive mind 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.156
 he was the guy who won titles by the amount of points 

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:59.437
 who could be faster than anyone on the ice 

00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:02.835
 who can kick stronger than anyone on the ice 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.765
 How could he be a quarterback? 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.070
 I'm saying is that if someone missed the puck on the other "Blue Line" 

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:12.941
 he protected the rear for you 

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:15.977
 Coming from the other side. He was good as well. 

00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:20.507
 He was going with the puck when he saw the opportunity, and saw if he could go ahead 

00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:25.242
 and He simply flew on the ice to aid in a goal or score a 

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:29.026
 or if he lost the puck he would recover returning to his "Blue Line" in an instant 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.128
 Although his excellent ability to skate was one of the reasons for making him brilliant 

00:06:37.242 --> 00:06:41.032
 Your willingness to start these various races 

00:06:42.108 --> 00:06:44.219
 They resulted in several collisions 

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:46.455
 It was Orr's legs that ended up suffering more 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.993
 The leg problem started in the game against the Leafs 

00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:55.690
 He took incredible chances with his body 

00:06:56.756 --> 00:07:01.271
 and the leafs had an old defender called Marcel Pronovost 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.764
 That he was a master at "Hip Check" 

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:07.310
 Pronovost went towards him in the glass 

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:12.774
 and instead of taking the direct hit, and keeping both feet on ice 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:15.151
 Orr tried the opposite 

00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:22.297
 and Pronovost caught his leg in the glass 

00:07:22.332 --> 00:07:26.234
 Bobby Orr is the type of player who wanted to play the game 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.258
 He already played injured. 

00:07:28.293 --> 00:07:32.569
 I've seen him in so many injuries that other players would be out for a month 

00:07:33.157 --> 00:07:37.408
 Bobby simply covered, threw ice and was going to play 

00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:39.910
 and he started to force himself too much 

00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:41.934
 But this was the kind of player he was 

00:07:42.798 --> 00:07:46.310
 He knows a player who has played 20 years in the NHL and had no leg problems 

00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:47.433
 He's very lucky. 

00:07:47.468 --> 00:07:49.929
 He was very unhappy. 

00:07:49.964 --> 00:07:53.230
 in having had so many procedures on his legs 

00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:54.505
 Not only in one, but in both 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:01.685
 And how he could play with so many leg problems would be hard to believe
