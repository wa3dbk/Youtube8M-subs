in<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.189> bit<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:29.910> anyways<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.390> kind

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

of thought this would be a good way to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
of thought this would be a good way to
bridge<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> gap<00:00:32.369> between<00:00:32.399> those<00:00:32.880> spots

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
bridge the gap between those spots

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
bridge the gap between those spots
