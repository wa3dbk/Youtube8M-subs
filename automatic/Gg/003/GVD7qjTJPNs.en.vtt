00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.310
 because today is May 4 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.720
 good 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.020
 lately it has been one of the best 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.190
 seasons to be a fan of star wars 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.700
 alive 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.970

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.560
 today if we have something to celebrate a 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.030
 new idiot movie just said 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.620
 we had trailers of the new movie 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.240
 we had a new series on the disney xd 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.250
 that nobody saw but we had the new 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.830
 series 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.810
 and well here we saw the trailer we liked 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.140
 if you have not seen the pique trailer 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.209
 up there to the picture you green very well 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.459
 now let's tell our points what 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.870
 what we expect from the new movie if not 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.100
 you're a fan of star wars you will not enjoy 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.140
 this video 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.140
 very good number one 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.560
 I hope a more complete plot is not 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.879
 shooting one of those frames as of 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.440
 Attacks of the clones were good 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.390
 movies but the plot apart from being 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.400
 very long and confused I had many 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.050
 holes that did not make much sense not 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.489
 it makes a bad film in fact I 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.519
 I became more fond of the specola you what 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.519
 you think 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.080
 a bit weird but I like the classic ones 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.080
 for its content 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.650
 two 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:16.420
 if it is what I hope 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:19.750
 thanks high number 3 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.910
 I hope to see a balance in the strength I 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.760
 I hope to see that the force darkens the side 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.360
 dark of strength and white strength 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.360
 good he 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.900
 the good good the force of light and the 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.420
 dark side of the force can 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.810
 coexist together 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.090
 I hope to see a union because good if 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.900
 are talking about peace and harmony should 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.950
 to exist a yang is what it is but you what 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.280
 you wait 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.500
 yang jianjun yin and yang I meant 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480
 exist so that the yin of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.650
 exist the yang you are what I wanted to say 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.180
 but but I'm very excited 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.830
 I do not understand you are with a chela 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.180
 hot 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.650
 with her it is very hot to suppose 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.650
 fears and then you know I think 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.540
 I 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.540
 4 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.850
 but also 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.600
 of what you expect 

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:45.689
 I told him but serious because really 

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:47.909
 I love in the ships of cholos 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.949
 turn the camera and finish 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.279
 ships hung situations but not 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.279
 we can 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:04.669
 544 the most monstrous creatures that 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.669
 appear like this 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.050
 and to end number 5 as peace 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.789
 what we expect is 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.530
 a concrete villain in the prequels that 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.690
 they are the latest star war movies 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.300
 that have been made we can see that there is no 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.010
 a good concrete villain we have a 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.040
 villain here a villain here and we saw 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.420
 as the plot weakened and suffered the 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.950
 plot suffers when there is not a good 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.950
 villain the galactic empire 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.740
 the galactic empire was a threat 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:50.009
 for the rebels that's why they were a great 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.169
 villain because you are a worm 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:57.110
 giant 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.110
 how important was the Mayan empire 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.390
 there are five things that we expect from the 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.190
 new movie we also do not wait for 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.750
 that those but something new from the 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.210
 movies you what do you also expect something 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.400
 new truth that they use the old and the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.900
 that the classic to the actors true the 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.360
 original actors that harrison ford 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.790
 mark hamill carrie fisher all of them 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.590
 They are great but we hope that also 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.700
 do something new and that is not repetitive 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.700
 the hernandez 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.080
 and it is that we 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:40.380
 he's so happy to sign this garbage 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:51.199
 and it is also safer 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:59.839
 I thought you are 30 you follow who asks 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.839
 she that if they follow the movies of her 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.820
 well that has been all thank you very much 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:10.080
 for watching the video forgive me for being so 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:13.009
 small but what are you doing 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.009
 with logos
