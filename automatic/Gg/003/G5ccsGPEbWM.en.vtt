really impressed with the play of this

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.360 
really impressed with the play of this
horn<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.780> got<00:00:33.960> some<00:00:34.170> nice<00:00:34.410> characteristics

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
horn it's got some nice characteristics

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.860 
horn it's got some nice characteristics
that<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.910> would<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.120> fitting<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that I think would be fitting on a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.959 
that I think would be fitting on a
professional<00:00:37.530> horn<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.610> know<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
professional horn I don't know that you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.119 
professional horn I don't know that you
can<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.440> there's<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> little

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
can see it here but there's a little

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.319 
can see it here but there's a little
demarcation<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.690> third<00:00:43.559> slide<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.969> what

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
demarcation on the third slide and what

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.330 
demarcation on the third slide and what
that<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.110> reservoir<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.950> hold

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that is it's a reservoir to hold

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.779 
that is it's a reservoir to hold
or<00:00:48.059> lubrication<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.250> holds<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.640> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
or lubrication and it just holds it in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
or lubrication and it just holds it in
there<00:00:50.940> longer<00:00:51.180> enables<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.140> slide<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
there longer enables your slide to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.410 
there longer enables your slide to
remain<00:00:54.829> properly<00:00:55.829> lubricated<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> longer

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
remain properly lubricated for a longer

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
remain properly lubricated for a longer
time<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:58.410> course<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> notice<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.430> bit

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
time of course you notice a little bit

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
time of course you notice a little bit
of<00:00:59.989> artwork<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.199> towards<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> end<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
of artwork here towards the end of the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
of artwork here towards the end of the
valve<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:03.120> slide<00:01:03.420> each<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> slides<00:01:04.379> have

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
valve or slide each of the slides have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.550 
valve or slide each of the slides have
that<00:01:04.979> valves<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.150> horn<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.600> absolutely

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that valves on this horn are absolutely

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
that valves on this horn are absolutely
tremendous

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tremendous

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
tremendous
a<00:01:08.820> nice<00:01:09.420> short<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.820> valve<00:01:11.820> stroke<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a nice short little valve stroke and I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.770 
a nice short little valve stroke and I
believe<00:01:14.010> although<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> horn<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:15.360> cleaned

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
believe although this horn I've cleaned

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390 
believe although this horn I've cleaned
it<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.229> haven't<00:01:16.500> had<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:16.799> work<00:01:16.950> done<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it but I haven't had any work done to it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
it but I haven't had any work done to it
I<00:01:17.580> believe<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> third<00:01:18.810> slide<00:01:19.200> dump<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I believe it's got a third slide dump is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
I believe it's got a third slide dump is
what<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> looks<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.430> could<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:20.970> mistaken<00:01:21.420> but

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
what it looks like could be mistaken but

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
what it looks like could be mistaken but
that<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> looks<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.009> point

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that is what it looks like at this point

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
that is what it looks like at this point
it's<00:01:23.460> definitely<00:01:24.060> stuck<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:25.290> much<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> light

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's definitely stuck very much a light

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.249 
it's definitely stuck very much a light
bell<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.970> horn<00:01:27.330> had<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.020> course<00:01:28.460> brass<00:01:30.259> valve

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
bell this horn had of course brass valve

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
bell this horn had of course brass valve
block<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.460> nickel<00:01:33.150> silver<00:01:33.600> coating

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
block and then the nickel silver coating

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
block and then the nickel silver coating
which<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> quite<00:01:35.040> scratched<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.270> Bell<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
which is quite scratched up the Bell is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
which is quite scratched up the Bell is
dented<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.110> believe<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> five<00:01:38.430> inch

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
dented I believe it's about a five inch

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
dented I believe it's about a five inch
bow<00:01:39.600> which<00:01:40.020> again<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.650> nice<00:01:40.890> fixed<00:01:41.400> finger

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
bow which again is nice fixed finger

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.819 
bow which again is nice fixed finger
ring<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.750> missing<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
ring it is missing as all of the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.660 
ring it is missing as all of the
galaxies<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.579> I've<00:01:44.700> seen<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.420> missing<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
galaxies that I've seen are missing the

stop mechanism for your third slide have

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
stop mechanism for your third slide have
to<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.149> find<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.600> those<00:01:51.750> but

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
to see if we can find one of those but

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.609 
to see if we can find one of those but
really<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:53.280> fun<00:01:53.790> little<00:01:54.030> horn<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> play<00:01:54.750> with

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
really a fun little horn to play with

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.550 
really a fun little horn to play with
the<00:01:55.799> lighter<00:01:56.100> Bell<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.180> does<00:01:57.479> rain<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the lighter Bell and it does rain it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
the lighter Bell and it does rain it
really<00:01:59.189> rings<00:01:59.460> fact<00:01:59.820> after<00:02:00.149> plane<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.479> can

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
really rings fact after plane I can

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.359 
really rings fact after plane I can
still<00:02:01.020> hear<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.229> ringing<00:02:01.500> sometimes<00:02:01.860> first

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
still hear it ringing sometimes first
