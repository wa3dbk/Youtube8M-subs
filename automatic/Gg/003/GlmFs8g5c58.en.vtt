00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
because every time I took it out by

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
because every time I took it out by
myself<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.799> had<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.100> reload<00:01:08.430> his<00:01:08.610> shield

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

came<00:01:09.180> back<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.570> immediately<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> after<00:01:12.210> about

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
came back up immediately so after about

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
came back up immediately so after about
three<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.020> four<00:01:13.229> waves<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.920> mobs<00:01:14.220> Gemma's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
three to four waves of mobs Gemma's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
three to four waves of mobs Gemma's
finally<00:01:15.630> showed<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> final<00:01:16.619> ship<00:01:16.979> with

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
finally showed up on the final ship with

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
finally showed up on the final ship with
a<00:01:17.490> few<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:17.970> mobs<00:01:18.210> after<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> he<00:01:19.470> kind<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
a few more mobs after that he kind of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070 
a few more mobs after that he kind of
snuck<00:01:20.460> himself<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.299> cave<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.780> here

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
snuck himself into this cave right here

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
snuck himself into this cave right here
but<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:23.009> made<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> easier<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.820> us

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but that actually made it easier for us

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.249 
but that actually made it easier for us
to<00:01:23.970> trap<00:01:24.210> him<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> corner<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.049> take

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to trap him in a corner and just take

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
to trap him in a corner and just take
out<00:01:25.409> his<00:01:25.530> shield<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.979> take<00:01:26.130> him<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:27.049> okay

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
out his shield and take him down okay

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.929 
out his shield and take him down okay
now<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.860> him<00:01:28.979> into<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.220> cave<00:01:29.520> we

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
now when we get him into the cave we

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
now when we get him into the cave we
pretty<00:01:30.210> much<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.450> start<00:01:31.020> wailing<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.619> him

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
pretty much just start wailing on him

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.910 
pretty much just start wailing on him
with<00:01:31.979> everything<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.930> after<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> few

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
with everything we have now after a few

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920 
with everything we have now after a few
minutes<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.000> forth<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.840> were

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
minutes of going back and forth we were
