00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.939
 in my gratitude that commenting I bring 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.649
 a new episode of nuclear mentality 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.810
 that either be more than a week of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.520
 something that did not go up and well here you have 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.590
 playing with my favorite weapon of the two 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.109
 as many know the lack with the finger 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.490
 pajero not like saying many and on the map 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.260
 de rate is a map that is doing very well 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.610
 the face good sum so that really to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.010
 I love it is a favorite of boats 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.560
 two and then you can play with any 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.270
 weapon would not be a good game that in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.270
 the map and such as we were going to 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.189
 talk about our ability not what 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.350
 would be our our strong point and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.489
 enhance it and so on you remember that good 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.230
 I'm fine a little related to that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 a while ago or if episode of the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 that focused on self-criticism is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.960
 say to see our life points is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.370
 say the opposite could be said and of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.170
 try to improve them do not learn from 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.399
 our mistakes try to improve it and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.010
 this well then to be a little what 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.749
 opposite but another different aspect does not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.789
 then before we start talking about 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.710
 episode but rather short is a 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.329
 well I did not say the game play is a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.069
 double nuclear face what happens that good 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.979
 the whole sub because then I make a 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.780
 run of 22 or 23 that or after but what 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.550
 that I always do the nuclear mentality 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 well, until they kill me, he left me, I do not leave 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.150
 until they kill me so good if I 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.130
 you would have agreed to nuclear the truth 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 is that he was a bit silly he was pretty 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.090
 crazy crazy head came to see ensures a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 little bit more as you could agree a clear 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 and you will see that in fact some double 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.490
 nuclear you will see me that in fact in this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.500
 in this streak 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 the last low is very risky right 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
 times sorry to explain why the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.570
 shit and why I'm lucky not so 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 good to tell you also before this that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 start tomorrow you have special 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.010
 100,000 subscribers because surely 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 We'll go tonight so many 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.400
 thanks kids is a special like 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.530
 I said the other day quite long 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.150
 I think it exceeds 20 minutes but that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.440
 not stop breaking the circle the truth 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.050
 they are all the time the best moments of 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.810
 my channel laughs angry songs games 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.160
 afraid of everything is not good either 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.510
 edited collaborations with others 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.460
 youtubers and such that good in minor 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.440
 each one has contributed its granite 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.800
 of sand so good is going to be 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.940
 pretty cool the special the truth and 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.020
 also tell you about the live that will be 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.880
 the game is for you to ask me 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.610
 many I'm going to create a new account 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 on ps3 and when it's the direct you the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.670
 I'll say to make it fairer and you can 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 enter the first 100 valeria 100 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 first ones with me the direct like this 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.370
 how good we are going there with the first strike 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.800
 also roll in the end almost did not talk 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.720
 nothing of the subject 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.970
 You see I've done the corn I've seen 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.530
 the uncle has turned and has fallen 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.390
 wait for me to go out by the little rock 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.370
 but I know he is waiting for me more 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.470
 that for the Portuguese because the uncle is 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.569
 there I am pointing and the pull on your hand 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.280
 so well what I do here is the 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.720
 part that I have luisa I see that there is one 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.980
 that was camping or not playing in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.810
 this case was not playing but neither 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.920
 I knew fixed another how is waiting for 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.470
 that came out on the left that will be 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.540
 easy and the medium that gets me not 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.680
 according to what putting it with a svb gives me a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.900
 I touch the back of the wall and they do not let me 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.370
 nothing red and good here is when I go 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.660
 first because I was changing then 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.280
 I was not playing first I've 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.810
 proven that it is good to play and for 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.190
 Last one we're going out the window 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.799
 because I was pointing the door not 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.299
 so as many times I say he 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.620
 Kisses helps us a lot also to choose the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.140
 order or if we want to kill people not 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.569
 but in this case I had enough 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.780
 Of course there was one champion I was going to 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.560
 go through his back, although surely 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.720
 it would have gone more or less the same 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.519
 played because I really did not know that the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.780
 sniper could have given me though 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.850
 I do not have much life but nothing like it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.650
 let's talk a little about that of 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.140
 today's topic that is our skill 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.230
 special or our strong point then 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.760
 well I do not know me when I play well as 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.230
 I told you the other time because there are times 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.180
 I get bad for example the one against 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.920
 one from very close sometimes I get bad at 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.720
 me for example I think I'm given 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.370
 well the subject the backs and the subject of 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.560
 processes play head carefully 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.000
 move around the map and well the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.380
 encounters each face in the resistance 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 It's okay , you give me pretty good 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.060
 so what I do many times is 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.590
 put me a gun also go well in my 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.970
 ability is to say if for example there is 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.830
 It's good for me to aim from afar and I have 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.450
 pretty good aim for my weapon 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.459
 preferred to be the phallus because it kills 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.780
 very much and 7-10 marks what happens 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.400
 that at close distances if you do not have 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.750
 the necessary aim will kill you in 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.180
 anything not although it is more 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.560
 needed is needed but that's why 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.090
 is that I have collected a need from 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.760
 I think that helps me to suffer a 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.490
 little the lack of 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.040
 short distance meetings and then 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.540
 Well, some of them come with her but 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.770
 What I wanted to comment on is that you 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.180
 the time to play when I'm when 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.970
 you to the same as the subject of 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.740
 your weak point you notice when you see 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.780
 playing which is our strong point if 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.670
 you are also the canacar asesores pound 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.400
 yes I also long encounters 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.380
 distance if that goes well for the map and 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.390
 what you have to do is take advantage of 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.040
 that apart from fixing also sometimes if 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.610
 I tried to improve in your points 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.230
 weak 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.700
 we have to strengthen our point 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.560
 strongly abuse them and is very good 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.090
 russia li you are very good every face os 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.590
 you put a short one and you do it because those 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.060
 much better than walking doing for 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.530
 example what I do that is to try 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.910
 predict payments we train very 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.800
 well for the map and the truth is that 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.690
 that's going to go much better the game if 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.570
 you play as you know not as 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.420
 others played or as you think you are going to 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.550
 play well but hey did not leave me old 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.260
 of rolls and this last break explained the 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.700
 shit that I do good we were seeing 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.080
 in the ub that I was going to upload an enemy 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.030
 there he had trained decided by what 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.740
 minus your kindness and and what I do is 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.420
 wrong to go after him because he has 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.310
 ged glynn and he was also with a fal 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.020
 although I burned myself in 97 and I also knew 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.490
 that a grenade here I'm lucky for 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.890
 two reasons why the guy is slow 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.390
 only gives me two bullets and because the pineapple 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.710
 humidity the pineapple is kept 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.360
 red that was very well has killed well 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.770
 that in that situation what I had to 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.210
 to have done is to have gone for these two 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.770
 that came behind or at least to 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.300
 one of them because it was so much easier 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.890
 to face an uncle who are gx with 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.090
 a slight no or was it a bit 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.400
 crazy and I should not have done 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.990
 that also works out well for me and I take out the 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.460
 nuclear should not have secured more 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.440
 in the last losses or equal the first 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.960
 low if you do but a low I have 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.550
 important as the last one because I do not 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.260
 I would play it but I was a little goat 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.700
 crazy so good nothing happens for a 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.100
 threat that I already say that this double 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.260
 nuclear fail because it was a bitch but I 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.730
 happened what exactly has appeared in the 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.160
 second streak that to do the crazy with 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.090
 the fence is close to kill me not so 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.990
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.310
 episode 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.990
 I can not comment much on the subject but it is 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.910
 that is simply that is a bullshit 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.710
 that if it's okay to play in a way 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.630
 Well, if you want to end a streak 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.160
 important a good game because 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.900
 focus on improving our ability 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.970
 strong and surely now it goes well 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.220
 also the expensive ones will go to the bag and 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.270
 catch rus you take a short and you go props 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.100
 butt so good do not forget 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.750
