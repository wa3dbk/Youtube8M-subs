00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
the 4th time who's the first part of the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.039 
the 4th time who's the first part of the
reverse<00:03:30.239> goes<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.690> this

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.360 

and<00:03:39.049> then<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.340> second<00:03:40.819> part<00:03:40.849> um<00:03:42.099> solvers<00:03:43.099> was

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
and then the second part um solvers was

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:52.119 
and then the second part um solvers was
like<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.840> make<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.379> E<00:03:51.409> minor<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:52.099> G

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
like this you make the E minor to G

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.220 
like this you make the E minor to G
major<00:03:52.609> by<00:03:52.849> adding<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.299> index<00:03:53.659> finger<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.200> the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
major by adding the index finger to the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:18.009 
major by adding the index finger to the
third<00:03:54.560> string<00:03:54.829> on<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.129> first<00:03:55.159> fret<00:04:17.019> chorus

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
third string on the first fret chorus

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:30.180 
third string on the first fret chorus
should<00:04:18.259> go<00:04:18.410> like<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:18.739> a/c<00:04:21.910> GED<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:28.630> then<00:04:29.630> e

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
should go like this a/c GED and then e

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.150 
should go like this a/c GED and then e
minor<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:33.620> then<00:04:34.460> G<00:04:34.940> again<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.650> mean<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.710> see<00:04:36.949> my

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
minor and then G again I mean you see my

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:48.559 
minor and then G again I mean you see my
bed<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:43.509> energy

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.240 

okay<00:04:49.569> so<00:04:50.259> then<00:04:50.469> basically<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:52.419> bridge<00:04:53.409> the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
okay so then basically the bridge the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.480 
okay so then basically the bridge the
bridge<00:04:54.430> will<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.150> like<00:04:55.539> this<00:04:56.129> will<00:04:57.129> be<00:04:57.310> like

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
bridge will be like this will be like

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.149 
bridge will be like this will be like
this<00:04:57.909> a<00:04:59.460> d<00:05:00.460> minor<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:02.229> index<00:05:02.590> finger<00:05:03.009> on<00:05:03.039> the

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
this a d minor the index finger on the

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:08.339 
this a d minor the index finger on the
first<00:05:03.520> string<00:05:03.669> first<00:05:04.360> fret<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:07.349> middle

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
string of the third fret so then I'll be

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:40.290 
string of the third fret so then I'll be
like<00:05:29.469> this<00:05:37.740> hey<00:05:38.740> minor<00:05:39.009> which<00:05:39.699> means<00:05:40.029> the

like this hey minor which means the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.420 
like this hey minor which means the
index<00:05:40.779> will<00:05:41.050> go<00:05:41.259> on<00:05:41.379> the<00:05:41.529> second<00:05:41.919> string<00:05:42.129> of

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
index will go on the second string of

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.600 
index will go on the second string of
the<00:05:42.699> first<00:05:42.939> fret<00:05:43.319> the<00:05:44.319> middle<00:05:44.620> finger<00:05:45.069> will<00:05:45.400> go
