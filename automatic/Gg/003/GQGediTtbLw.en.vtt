a house that I maintained for the owner
lucite<00:00:06.120> estate<00:00:06.649> it's<00:00:07.649> pretty<00:00:07.859> cool<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.069> think

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
lucite estate it's pretty cool I think

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.230 
lucite estate it's pretty cool I think
it's<00:00:08.460> from<00:00:08.610> 1968<00:00:09.389> or<00:00:09.570> 69<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:11.240> particle

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
it's from 1968 or 69 it's a particle

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.770 
it's from 1968 or 69 it's a particle
board<00:00:12.599> looks<00:00:13.139> like<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:15.000> Front's<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.450> actual

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
board looks like the Front's got actual

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.650 
board looks like the Front's got actual
wood<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.970> it's<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.210> black<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.480> white

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
wood on it it's a black and white

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.849 
wood on it it's a black and white
shouldn't<00:00:21.660> turn<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.470> course<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.710> won't

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
shouldn't turn it on of course we won't

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.950 
shouldn't turn it on of course we won't
be<00:00:22.980> able<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.279> any<00:00:23.369> channels

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.280 

there<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.140> go

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.220 

it's<00:00:37.440> controls<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.430> bottom

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it's controls down the bottom

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:52.760 
it's controls down the bottom
that<00:00:40.440> don't<00:00:40.680> appear<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.190> labels<00:00:41.430> anymore

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.639 

yeah<00:00:53.340> unfortunately<00:00:53.610> there's<00:00:54.240> no

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.209 

there<00:00:57.039> are<00:00:57.190> no<00:00:58.530> stations<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.680> don't<00:00:59.860> think<00:01:00.070> that

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
there are no stations I don't think that

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.709 
there are no stations I don't think that
we<00:01:00.309> can<00:01:00.430> pull<00:01:00.670> in<00:01:00.790> with<00:01:00.910> rabbit<00:01:01.300> ears<00:01:01.480> around

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
we can pull in with rabbit ears around

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:02.250 
we can pull in with rabbit ears around
here

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
here

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.350 
here
I<00:01:02.290> believe<00:01:02.920> there's<00:01:03.129> only<00:01:03.250> one<00:01:03.760> analog

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
I believe there's only one analog

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.090 
I believe there's only one analog
station<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:05.019> we<00:01:05.140> can<00:01:05.320> get<00:01:05.470> around<00:01:05.680> here<00:01:05.830> and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
station that we can get around here and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
station that we can get around here and
you<00:01:06.159> need<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.420> pretty<00:01:07.420> big<00:01:07.600> antenna<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.290> do<00:01:08.440> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you need a pretty big antenna to do it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200 
you need a pretty big antenna to do it
let's<00:01:11.560> see<00:01:11.770> how<00:01:11.890> do<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.009> even<00:01:12.190> get<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.640> VHF

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
let's see how do you even get to the VHF

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.690 
let's see how do you even get to the VHF
on<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.600> our<00:01:13.990> UHF<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.740> miss<00:01:14.890> them<00:01:17.310> no<00:01:18.310> there<00:01:18.610> we

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
on this our UHF I miss them no there we

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.760 
on this our UHF I miss them no there we
go<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.860> hell<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.250> work<00:01:22.440> then<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:23.560> turn

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
go the hell is that work then you turn

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
go the hell is that work then you turn
this<00:01:23.950> dial<00:01:24.220> that's<00:01:24.820> four

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.160 

interesting<00:01:31.750> way<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:31.990> tune

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.160 

I<00:01:39.940> know<00:01:40.940> that's<00:01:41.060> right<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.770> really<00:01:42.979> weird

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
I know that's right that is really weird

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.320 
I know that's right that is really weird
it's<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.260> fine<00:01:45.560> tuning<00:01:46.040> an<00:01:46.250> UHF<00:01:46.820> tuning<00:01:47.150> knob

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
it's a fine tuning an UHF tuning knob

00:01:47.330 --> 00:02:00.420 
it's a fine tuning an UHF tuning knob
and<00:01:47.570> one<00:01:56.110> like<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.259> index<00:01:57.710> tuners<00:01:58.190> better

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
and one like the index tuners better

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.469 
and one like the index tuners better
though<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.460> guess<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:01.940> helps<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.270> flip

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
though I guess this helps you flip

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:12.720 
though I guess this helps you flip
throwin<00:02:02.750> fast

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.800 

eighty-three<00:02:13.659> channels<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.290> nothing<00:02:14.680> on
