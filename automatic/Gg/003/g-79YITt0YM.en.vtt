timing with the timing go on your car so
it's<00:00:07.379> just<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.859> basic<00:00:08.130> timing<00:00:08.670> done<00:00:08.820> from

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
it's just a basic timing done from

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.799 
it's just a basic timing done from
harbour<00:00:09.360> fright<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:10.230> works<00:00:10.469> really<00:00:10.650> well

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
harbour fright it works really well

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.959 
harbour fright it works really well
first<00:00:12.809> thing<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> want<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.740> hook<00:00:14.730> up

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
first thing you want to do is hook up

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.570 
first thing you want to do is hook up
your<00:00:15.540> red<00:00:16.109> clip<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> red<00:00:17.039> positive

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
your red clip to the red positive

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.929 
your red clip to the red positive
terminal<00:00:18.270> your<00:00:18.600> black<00:00:18.840> clip<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> negative

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
terminal your black clip to the negative

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.580 
terminal your black clip to the negative
and<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.390> clip<00:00:21.689> right<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.380> goes

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
and then this clip right here it goes

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.320 
and then this clip right here it goes
around<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> number<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.640> spark<00:00:24.060> plug

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
around the number one spark plug

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
around the number one spark plug
terminal<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.490> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
terminal so you want to put it on the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.889 
terminal so you want to put it on the
number<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.539> spark<00:00:31.050> plug<00:00:31.320> wire<00:00:32.690> it's<00:00:33.690> either

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
number one spark plug wire it's either

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.680 
number one spark plug wire it's either
your<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:34.530> spark<00:00:35.370> plug<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.940> into<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
your first spark plug going into the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.619 
your first spark plug going into the
head<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:38.100> also<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.670> mine<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.090> says<00:00:39.300> number

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
head or it also on mine it says number

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.030 
head or it also on mine it says number
one<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> wire<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.820> pretty<00:00:41.820> easy<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:43.040> just

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
one on the wire so pretty easy now just

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.420 
one on the wire so pretty easy now just
start<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.640> car<00:00:52.039> put<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> warm<00:00:53.340> up

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
start up your car put a warm up

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.200 
start up your car put a warm up
on<00:00:55.850> my<00:00:56.180> car<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.750> use<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.050> jumper<00:00:57.770> wire

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
on my car you have to use a jumper wire

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.560 
on my car you have to use a jumper wire
it's<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.360> late<00:00:59.600> age<00:00:59.810> Toyota<00:01:00.700> okay<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.970> puts<00:01:02.420> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
it's a late age Toyota okay it puts the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.649 
it's a late age Toyota okay it puts the
idler<00:01:03.050> down

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.630 

you<00:01:08.960> might<00:01:09.170> not<00:01:09.290> have<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.650> do<00:01:09.800> this<00:01:09.980> it<00:01:10.310> really

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
you might not have to do this it really

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.110 
you might not have to do this it really
depends<00:01:10.970> on<00:01:11.030> your<00:01:11.090> car<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.790> then<00:01:13.940> you<00:01:14.090> just

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
depends on your car so then you just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.980 
depends on your car so then you just
take<00:01:14.330> your<00:01:14.600> gun

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 

when<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.380> their<00:01:22.560> mark<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> trampoline

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
when you see their mark on a trampoline

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.530 
when you see their mark on a trampoline
you<00:01:25.549> can't<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> video<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> first

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you can't see on the video but the first

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.899 
you can't see on the video but the first
one<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:30.990> far<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.860> zero<00:01:32.250> degrees<00:01:32.580> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
one to the far right is zero degrees the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
one to the far right is zero degrees the
second<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.020> 5<00:01:34.290> degrees

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
second one is 5 degrees

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
second one is 5 degrees
the<00:01:35.550> third<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.000> seven<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> fourth<00:01:37.200> 112<00:01:38.600> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the third one seven and a fourth 112 so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230 
the third one seven and a fourth 112 so
minus<00:01:40.200> five<00:01:40.770> degrees<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.940> perfect

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
minus five degrees so it's that perfect

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.090 
minus five degrees so it's that perfect
right<00:01:42.630> now

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
right now

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.570 
right now
so<00:01:45.380> yeah<00:01:46.380> pretty<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.800> how<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.159> pick<00:01:47.430> your

so yeah pretty much how you pick your

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.880 
so yeah pretty much how you pick your
timing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
timing
