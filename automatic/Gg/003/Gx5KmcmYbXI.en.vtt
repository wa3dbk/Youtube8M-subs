to block better so I guess actually not

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
to block better so I guess actually not
that<00:00:49.590> surprising<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.250> audio<00:00:50.520> yeah<00:00:50.969> go

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:58.470 
the middle of the screen we're good
locks

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480
