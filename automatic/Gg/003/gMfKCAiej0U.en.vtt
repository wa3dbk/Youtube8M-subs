can start recording straight on to the
voice<00:00:26.670> memos<00:00:27.090> app<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.840> has<00:00:27.869> three<00:00:28.470> switches<00:00:28.980> on

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
voice memos app it has three switches on

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.589 
voice memos app it has three switches on
it<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> great<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.240> things<00:00:30.420> like

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it which is great for things like

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
it which is great for things like
interviews<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.590> voiceovers<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:32.520> right

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
interviews or voiceovers and then right

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.840 
interviews or voiceovers and then right
up<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> live<00:00:33.750> music<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.920> basically<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.610> using

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
up to live music but basically I'm using

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
up to live music but basically I'm using
the<00:00:36.090> microphone<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> record<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.020> audio<00:00:37.140> right

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the microphone to record the audio right

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
the microphone to record the audio right
now<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.579> up<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> decide<00:00:39.300> whether

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
now so it's up to you to decide whether

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
now so it's up to you to decide whether
you<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> sound<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.829> not

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
you like the sound of it or not

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
you like the sound of it or not
but<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.610> also<00:00:41.730> using<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.390> application

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
but I'm also using the application

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
but I'm also using the application
called<00:00:43.320> vocal<00:00:43.739> live<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.250> record<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> audio<00:00:44.820> so

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
called vocal live to record the audio so

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.840 
called vocal live to record the audio so
it's<00:00:45.780> probably<00:00:46.020> got<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> reverb

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
it's probably got a little bit of reverb

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
it's probably got a little bit of reverb
here<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> effects<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.710> my

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
here are a little bit of effects on my

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.340 
here are a little bit of effects on my
voice<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.539> applications<00:00:52.079> like

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
voice but up with applications like

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.860 
voice but up with applications like
voice<00:00:53.039> memos<00:00:53.399> there's<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.090> voice<00:00:54.390> editing

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
voice memos there's no voice editing

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
voice memos there's no voice editing
they're<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.469> straight<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.039> recording<00:00:56.579> but

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
they're just straight up recording but

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.180 
they're just straight up recording but
yeah<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.539> use<00:00:57.719> apps<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.559> GarageBand

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
yeah you can use apps like GarageBand

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.160 
yeah you can use apps like GarageBand
with<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> little<00:01:00.030> funky<00:01:00.690> editing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
with it and get a little funky editing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
with it and get a little funky editing
in<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> give<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.789 
in there and I'm just going to give you
a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.570> taste<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> microphone

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
a little taste of what the microphone

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
a little taste of what the microphone
sounds<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.909> things<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.530> guitar

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sounds like with things like the guitar

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.120 
sounds like with things like the guitar
just<00:01:08.390> bear<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.510> mind<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.900> am<00:01:09.960> NOT<00:01:10.320> good<00:01:11.010> at

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
metal and it feels quite Drupal but now

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
can plug the mic into most I devices and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.370 
can plug the mic into most I devices and
also<00:02:18.690> some<00:02:18.959> Mac's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
also some Mac's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.100 
also some Mac's
but<00:02:19.860> that's<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.970> mic<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.269> limited<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.900> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
but that's all the mic is limited to I
