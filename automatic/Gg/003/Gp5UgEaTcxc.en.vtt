00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 simpson let's start one where does the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.240
 yellow color the striking tone should 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 surprise when doing 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.750
 zapping through television channels 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.400
 and apparently it worked very well two 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.529
 tributes made names to willem and the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 homero's best friends for it have 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.720
 names similar to karl marx and vladimir 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 lenin in honor of them and I used it the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.280

 nixon 3 absolute and total property of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.210
 Matt groening something egocentric the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 creator of the series determined that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.710
 some of your personal preferences or 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.079
 identifying signs should 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 appear between the characters and so what 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.579
 he made his particular footprints are 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.739
 quite curious as the fact that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.620
 as a left-hander for example makes many 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 of his characters are also up to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.129

 its creator knows well how to mark his

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.360
 screenwriters and caricaturists had to 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.850
