00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
to inspiring making something special so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
to inspiring making something special so
I<00:01:21.299> stopped<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> first<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> rosemary

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I stopped it first with the rosemary

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
I stopped it first with the rosemary
then<00:01:23.549> I'm<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.090> insert<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.869> couple<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
then I'm going to insert a couple of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
then I'm going to insert a couple of
slices<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.130> orange<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> rent<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.049> well

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
slices of orange I have to rent as well

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.130 
slices of orange I have to rent as well
I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> gives<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.909> bit<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
I think it gives a little bit more of a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
I think it gives a little bit more of a
kick<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> flavor<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.549> obviously<00:01:33.119> since

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
kick to the flavor and obviously since

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.969 
kick to the flavor and obviously since
we<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.659> putting<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.110> much<00:01:34.259> salt<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we are putting so much salt on the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
we are putting so much salt on the
outside<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.700> need<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> solve<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
outside we don't need to solve it on the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.510 
outside we don't need to solve it on the
inside<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.860> lastly<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.909> couple<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
inside and then lastly a couple of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.260 
inside and then lastly a couple of
leaves<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.820> sage<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.340> give<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:44.970> nice

of<00:02:06.670> salt<00:02:06.970> at<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.360> bottom<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.140> promise<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:08.890> that

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
of salt at the bottom I promise you that

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.130 
of salt at the bottom I promise you that
even<00:02:09.250> if<00:02:09.340> you're<00:02:09.550> using<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.119> much<00:02:10.270> salt<00:02:10.660> this

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
even if you're using so much salt this

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.050 
even if you're using so much salt this
recipe<00:02:11.380> will<00:02:11.620> not<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:12.100> salty<00:02:12.550> at<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:12.760> because

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
recipe will not be salty at all because

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.510 
recipe will not be salty at all because
the<00:02:13.330> fact<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.650> skills<00:02:15.040> outside

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
the fact that we have the skills outside

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.780 
the fact that we have the skills outside
of<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.720> skin<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.470> branzino<00:02:17.830> will<00:02:18.160> attract

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
of the skin of the branzino will attract

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.880 
of the skin of the branzino will attract
all<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.090> salt<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.230> actually<00:02:20.260> crack

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
all the salt so you can actually crack

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.060 
all the salt so you can actually crack
open<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.090> salt<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> skin<00:02:23.320> together<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
open the salt and the skin together and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.820 
open the salt and the skin together and
reveal<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.610> very<00:02:25.090> moist<00:02:25.510> flash<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
reveal a very moist flash of the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.979 
reveal a very moist flash of the
branzino<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:28.500> am<00:02:29.500> positioning<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.250> branzinos

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
branzino I am positioning the branzinos

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.310 
branzino I am positioning the branzinos
in<00:02:32.310> my<00:02:33.310> pan<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:36.190> will<00:02:36.610> make<00:02:36.850> sure<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.320> they

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
in my pan and I will make sure that they

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.160 
in my pan and I will make sure that they
actually<00:02:38.830> are<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.520> same<00:02:39.760> direction

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
actually are in the same direction

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.360 
actually are in the same direction
usually<00:02:41.170> when<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.410> keep<00:02:41.590> cooked<00:02:42.070> seafood

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
usually when you keep cooked seafood

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.270 
usually when you keep cooked seafood
together<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.390> two<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:44.019> more<00:02:44.230> fishes<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.040> want

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
together in two or more fishes you want

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.300 
together in two or more fishes you want
to<00:02:45.550> actually<00:02:45.940> position<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.950> tail

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
to actually position it so that the tail

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.330 
to actually position it so that the tail
is<00:02:48.580> opposed<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.019> head<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.830> next<00:02:51.160> one

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
is opposed to the head of the next one

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.490 
is opposed to the head of the next one
but<00:02:51.580> in<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.820> case<00:02:52.150> i'll<00:02:52.480> show<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.019> exactly

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
but in this case i'll show you exactly

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.650 
but in this case i'll show you exactly
why<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.459> need<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.790> do<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.300> opposite<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:57.660> now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
why we need to do the opposite and now

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.420 
why we need to do the opposite and now
more<00:02:59.200> salt<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.799> top<00:03:00.870> we're<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.140> add<00:03:02.430> salt

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
more salt on top we're going to add salt

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.729 
more salt on top we're going to add salt
on<00:03:03.640> top<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:04.000> each<00:03:04.239> single<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
on top of each single one of the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.310 
on top of each single one of the
branzinos<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:06.580> we<00:03:06.820> are<00:03:07.060> avoiding<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:08.079> head

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
branzinos but we are avoiding the head

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.440 
branzinos but we are avoiding the head
there<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.100> reason<00:03:09.340> for<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.209> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
there is a reason for this and the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.979 
there is a reason for this and the
reason<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.549> when<00:03:12.549> during<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.570> cooking

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
reason is that when during the cooking

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.710 
reason is that when during the cooking
process<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.730> eye<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.360> branzino

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
process the the eye of the branzino

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.130 
process the the eye of the branzino
turns<00:03:17.290> white<00:03:17.620> then<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.820> exactly<00:03:19.269> when<00:03:19.900> we

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
turns white then that is exactly when we

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.050 
turns white then that is exactly when we
have<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.440> stop<00:03:20.680> cooking<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.730> recipe

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
have to stop cooking it this recipe

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.720 
have to stop cooking it this recipe
actually<00:03:22.540> originated<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.650> ancient<00:03:23.769> Egypt<00:03:24.549> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
actually originated in ancient Egypt and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
actually originated in ancient Egypt and
then<00:03:24.959> either<00:03:25.959> rise<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.920> Portugal<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.060> finally

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
then either rise in Portugal and finally

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.420 
then either rise in Portugal and finally
in<00:03:28.989> Italy<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:29.320> it's<00:03:29.650> really<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.130> very

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
in Italy so it's really a very

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.120 
in Italy so it's really a very
Mediterranean<00:03:31.230> recipe<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.709> will<00:03:32.890> have

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
Mediterranean recipe and you will have

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.550 
Mediterranean recipe and you will have
all<00:03:33.400> your<00:03:34.060> guests<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.110> all<00:03:35.200> your<00:03:35.380> friends

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
wowed by this so I am spreading the salt

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.949 
wowed by this so I am spreading the salt
so<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.170> actually<00:03:41.320> code<00:03:41.950> everything

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
so that it actually code everything

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.550 
so that it actually code everything
adding<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.049> little<00:03:44.200> bit

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
adding a little bit

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.110 
adding a little bit
over<00:03:45.069> here<00:03:46.980> you're<00:03:47.980> like<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.370> said<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:48.910> to

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
over here you're like I said you have to

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.030 
over here you're like I said you have to
disregard<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.780> head<00:03:49.989> but<00:03:50.349> you<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.590> also<00:03:50.739> just

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
disregard the head but you can also just

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.309 
disregard the head but you can also just
regards<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.880> tails<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:52.630> not<00:03:52.810> really

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
regards the tails it's not really

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.620 
regards the tails it's not really
necessary<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.920> cover<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.430> tails<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.270> now

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
necessary to cover the tails and now

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.350 
necessary to cover the tails and now
that<00:03:56.170> everything<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:56.980> covered<00:03:57.640> pretty<00:03:58.209> much

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
that everything is covered pretty much

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.500 
that everything is covered pretty much
entirely<00:03:59.370> we<00:04:00.370> are<00:04:00.520> going<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.849> put<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.330> the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
entirely we are going to put it in the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.130 
entirely we are going to put it in the
oven<00:04:01.540> at<00:04:02.010> 400<00:04:03.010> degrees<00:04:03.310> for<00:04:03.849> more<00:04:04.120> or<00:04:04.239> less<00:04:04.390> 35

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
oven at 400 degrees for more or less 35

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.860 
oven at 400 degrees for more or less 35
to<00:04:05.349> 40<00:04:05.650> minutes<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.069> when<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.180> eye<00:04:07.209> gets

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
to 40 minutes and when the eye gets

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.780 
to 40 minutes and when the eye gets
white<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.769> that's<00:04:09.160> why<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.400> leave

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
white and that's why you leave

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.640 
white and that's why you leave
everything<00:04:10.209> I'm<00:04:10.510> covered<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.200> when<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.620> eye

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
everything I'm covered so when the eye

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.220 
everything I'm covered so when the eye
of<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.950> Valentino<00:04:12.670> becomes<00:04:13.239> white<00:04:13.540> that's

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
of the Valentino becomes white that's

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.310 
of the Valentino becomes white that's
when<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.680> brands<00:04:14.950> in<00:04:15.069> is<00:04:15.160> cooked<00:04:16.139> we<00:04:17.139> are

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320
