00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.759
 july at the start the seven golden rules 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.759
 a vegan diet 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 that's the topic in this video and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.230
 True, it will be time to bring it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 yes more and more people vegan more and more 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 people are pulling in everything and me 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.560
 I thought we could do it 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.019
 seven rules so together 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.599
 the most important job is simple 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.920
 really as varied as 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.449
 possible to eat 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 I already have that in one 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.300
 another video tells you have a big one 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 bandwidth fresh fruits vegetables 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.290
 legumes wholegrain these 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.300
 All these things are best bio 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 best of all from the garden of dollars 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 or something yes that is then in principle 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 already the second rule the third rule 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.079
 vitamin b12 and the dreisam present 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.449
 from a legal source 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.000
 You should see that we at least 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.770
 sometimes three to four thousand international 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 units consumed every day that is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.549
 Also, no deer not just for vegans 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 but everyone should do that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.710
 yes lot also belongs to the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.570
 third rule to iodine is namely one 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.880
 big problems have the resignations 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.030
 You can either pick it up from aigen or 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.619
 from iodine salt, yes, but I do not like that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.670
 that's why i would 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.950
 really say that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.380
 get your own shoots you with the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 musicians and then it fits the whole thing 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 next one is also very important 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.259
 Thing 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.270
 vitamin c containing drinks in front of the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.000
 meals or stop as an alternative 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 paprika strawberry lemon orange test 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 also very vitamin I hold things in advance 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 to eat and why the iron intake 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 to optimize yes she has in principle 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 vitamin c optimizes iron absorption in the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.869
 body so it makes sense just before 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.090
 which eat vitamin c containing 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.759
 reinzuziehen 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.500
 really 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.850
 lemon or as I said paprika in front 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.429
 eat whichever is you eat 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.969
 Paprika before really really right 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.579
 horny snack then really waived 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.039
 on refined sugar so do not care if it 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.950
 now cane sugar eat even if 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.140
 I do not do anything he cane 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.340
 with cinnamon that's just how it is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.319
 is not good you should be there 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.000
 as far as possible do without it in the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.599
 Product pay attention that no sugar 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.489
 inside is because it just definitely definitive 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.480
 absolutely unhealthy 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.420
 then you should really open up too 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.220
 Wheat more so do without this whole 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.660
 wheaten wheat flour so all this 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 things because it teaches in the principle 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.829
 carbohydrates but also much more 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.890
 is already quite disreputable 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:40.190
 because time is just so genetically crass 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.230
 is changed then we have 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.349
 of course, the fat so completely 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.930
 so it's important to avoid oils and fats 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.000
 additional if you do not know now 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.799
 a peanut butter bread is then you have 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 the first butterfat sometimes is one 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.400
 little palm fat with in it is coming 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.650
 what you half take but that is 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.609
 not so tragic now 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.200
 extra fat content of mine though 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.190
 fry now then does not skin somehow 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.870
 in half a half bottle of olive oil with it 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.450
 salad still extra oil cereal or how 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.920
 always try to avoid it because 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.109
 fat is really not that useful 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.579
 for the body in measure yes but not in 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.859
 these masses like us today 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.720
 unfortunately not even if eat everywhere 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.239
 you can eat today in the German kitchen 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.950
 could go then so that is 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.319
 meets vettel 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.450
 that should not be snappy mega 3 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.950
 fatty acids that is the omega-3 fatty acid 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.109
 you get the best from fresh 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.599
 ground flaxseed or from china 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.730
 seeds you should be the cia beforehand 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.530
 submit that they hold 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.410
 also stomach better absorb 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.849
 yes yes then last but not least 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.760
 industrially processed foods 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.290
 should the just somehow rarely 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.519
 consume or leave that completely 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.190
 So I say I have for example 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.500
 also 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.750
 Doner video made I have peter video 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.590
 made yes thats natural or too 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.230
 noodles 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.870
 yes that's we can organic wholegrain 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.460
 buy but I am still anyway 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.240
 processed foods and the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.950
 you really should not eat yes because 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.080
 it usually just keeps dead matter 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.120
 is the half processed and it is 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.440
 the more complicated it is processed 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.570
 usually on for the body that 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.040
 what else is it now 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.290
 for example, with a raise sheikh or 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.360
 what's good, where's something out there? 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.060
 is isolated and not now somehow 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.340
 yes it will be processed but the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.050
 a certain building block is isolated out 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.430
 and you do not drink in shape either 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.860
 maybe once a day should be five times a day 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.480
 at the day or with me for 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.020
 example I just take me as 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.370
 example 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.890
 I drink two to three times a week 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.450
 sheikh that's how it was supposed to be 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.130
 I hope you have the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.830
 seven golden rules fell 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.210
 for a vegan diet and we'll see 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.260
 us in the next video gives me thumbs 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.260
 is high
