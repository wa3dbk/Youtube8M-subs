00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 or the one that tried the guys from youtube my 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.450
 name is scales and good then here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.490
 we have a new video of how 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 unlock the bootloader for the xperia 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 mini and x10 and well then let's start 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 The first thing to do is 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 download these two files that I 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 I will upload them in winrar format but 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 well it happens that we do not have tablets 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.219
 as you can see one is the s1 tool and the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.290
 another is msm7227 once we 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.940
 we have downloaded open the folder of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.280
 youtube and we open this file 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.320
 normally without administrator and without anything 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.829
 at this moment we have to have the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 mobile disconnected and turned off ok 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.180
 off and disconnected and we're going to give it 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.699
 here this will appear and in this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.170
 moment we have to take the mobile as 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.510
 he mentioned has to be off and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.059
 before connecting it to the usb we have to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 leave the back key pressed or be 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.440
 before connecting it we have to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.750
 have it the key pressed and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.560
 the pressed key we are going to connect it 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.560
 at this time 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.420
 and good to connect it and list 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 how can you see 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.150
 good is going to serve us to give us the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 information of our mobile this you are 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 letters that you see here if they are in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.990
 capital letters means that we do not have 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.649
 the bootloader unlocked in my case not 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.880
 I have it and if we have these here write 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.500
 what it certifies is that it's going to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.509
 allow to do what is unlocking 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.799
 of the module to see how he mentioned this to 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 it is simply to know the information 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.539
 and it is to not have problems when trying 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.939
 update and we will give no 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.899
 error we can buy the phone 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.409
 well in this case we can close 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.119
 this and we have to learn the mobile 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.420
 Well, once we're done 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.520
 this step then we will learn the mobile 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.380
 ok and let's activate the usb circulation 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.479
 ok the mobile already has is offline 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.159
 we have closed the program and everything and we are going to 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.060
 go to configuration on the mobile 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.890
 configuration applications development and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.390
 here we are going to mark the little arrow 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.220
 USB debugging 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 we accept and good and we 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.790
 we went to the normal menu at that time 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 we put the phone aside and we go to the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.140
 msm7227 folder we open and execute 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.810
 we extract this extractive icon 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.180
 normal without administrator and nothing and good 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.579
 what we are going to do first is to take the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.440
 mobile and connect it just normal the 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.569
 phone has to be on but with 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.010
 a usb debugger 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.050
 ok then let's remove the caps from 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.180
 here 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.290
 and connect and wait for no 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.710
 will be driver if it has to 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.710
 install drivers 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.560
 Y 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.890
 connected 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.040
 we can connect the phone ok in this 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.420
 Well then we have it here 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.530
 we work any key in my case 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.630
 press enter and reading reprimanded 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.660
 well again we have to try since 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.970
 the slight criteria are downloaded ok 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.450
 we repeat the step if it is that we do not 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.450
 it worked 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.760
 As you can see, it's taking more than 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.400
 normal and it is already starting to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.140
 do the whole process none of the other 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.410
 world we are simply here watching 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.410
 this 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.220
 and you can see that the phone restarts 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.200
 just the phone and well, it 's a 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.780
 It took a little while but we'll be back 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.220
 do this again that is here 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.010
 we hope as you can see it is taking 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.310
 more than anything for the good drivers 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.200
 or nothing 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.200
 in this case we already have what is the 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.000
 phone with the bot letters blocked and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.190
 in that moment we will see 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.780
 so we'll see how it is that we already have 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.700
 the unlocked bootloader must see 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.590
 but with this we will repeat the step one 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.500
 Once you learn the phone, we will repeat the 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.720
 step of 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.060
 you can be there 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.770
 open the other program this would not be here 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.240
 but this is no longer there we no longer have 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.400
 trigger another this key simply 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.780
 we close the program and we're going to turn off the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.389
 Mobile in the mobile has already pinned me 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.770
 as to disconnect and we're going to go another 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.210
 once in half be everything so that for 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.980
 ensure that we already have the marker 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.919
 unlocked how are you going to show the 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.840
 process we give you here identify good 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.410
 we wait for the phone to cover up because 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.410
 it's going away 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.590
 but masters 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.880
 and is now as well as from prison to another 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.350
 we leave when the key is off 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.350
 from behind and connect 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.750
 ok now how can you see the keys 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.120
 the letters already appear in lowercase 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.470
 and we will press in slim certify us the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.630
 these keyboards means that already 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.610
 we have the sign have unlocked and 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.440
 posada guys this is a friend then a 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.690
 little maybe jobs or maybe a little 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.950
 long for what we have to do but 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.810

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.100
