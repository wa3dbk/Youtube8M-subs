00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.360
 Y 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.840
 all right 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
 good morning in this envelope you will find 5 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.770
 questions that should answer 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 during the day 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.330
 we started directly by the first 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 who are you and where are we now my 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.610
 name is antonio lamb I am director 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.980
 general of black stock founded 70 ago 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.720
 years as a family company we 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.330
 we find in Extremadura in the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.120
 southwest of spain here we produce ham 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.120
 Iberian for shelter and let's go 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.950
 i 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.950
 do not 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.060
 how can you recognize a pig 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.090
 Iberian 'here we have a 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 typical Iberian pork with its 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.649
 peculiar characteristics in which 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.090
 they have a thin leg, a black hoof and 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.100
 that is why it is called ham 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.549
 Iberian black leg as we can see 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.700
 They live in the middle of nature in the countryside 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.860
 total freedom the surface of the farm 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.179
 where we are right now is 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.159
 of 400 hectares no doubt this does everything 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.950
 the exercise that pigs perform 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.340
 fats and meat are different 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.440
 has an infiltrated fat that in the end 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 it generates a characteristic flavor 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.820
 what criteria are important at the time 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.770
 to be Iberian 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.620
 the first important thing that we have to 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.050
 to do is select pigs that have 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.790
 qualities to be able to take advantage of 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.660
 dehesa in second place is very 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.350
 important to see the shape of the pigs at 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.910
 end of the process what we do is 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.890
 make sure that the quality of each one 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.700
 of our pigs is the ideal for 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.690
 produce love 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.450
 the pigs are fed with acorn 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.240
 grass natural pastures and what 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 they find in these extensive surfaces 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.020
 of dehesa I think they are happy to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.020
 to live here 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.050
 we are in the dryers 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.959
 natural is a slow process with the 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.819
 temperature control humidity and 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.200
 long time we got that ham 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.410
 go dry the salt brings to the ham the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.840
 characteristic flavor and it helps us 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.080
 conservation and the healing process 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.980
 of the ham is absolutely natural with 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.360
 a contribution of natural animal fat and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.360
 with sea salt 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.770
 we have a test let's see three 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.800
 Soaps can tell us which one is ready 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.790
 to eat but we'll see it I think that 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:36.319
 yes 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:38.569
 and this ham is missing something from 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.269
 healing is still missing a bit of 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.099
 texture would be lacking in some months in 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.099
 this one is more tender is not yet 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.720
 is perfect this is the one we're going to 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.720
 eat 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.080
 since a pig is born until 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.040
 we can eat this ham have passed 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.459
 approximately between 4 and 5 years 16 or 17 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.620
 months that the pig has and three years that 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.069
 it took us to complete the elaboration of 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.709
 ham now we go to a friend's bar 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.709
 to take a good ham let 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.410
 how is popular Iberian ham in 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.050
 Spain, because Iberian ham 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.360
 considers one of the jewels of the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.510
 Spanish gastronomy must not be lacking in 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.510
 any celebration between friends or with 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.730
 family and we can take it in tapas or 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.900
 we can also take it in salads in 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.940
 another type of food is a unique flavor 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.110
 characteristic soft and we can say that 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.110
 It is a unique product in the world 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.160
 It has been a pleasure for me to teach 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.160
 teach our traditions on 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.780
 Iberian good trip until then what 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.780
 you pass well to another
