00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
 they are on strips but even in this position 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 noticeably different from the picture from 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.430
 reality mayor of Minsk hurries

 numbers need to run 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.900
 he doesn't want to do this today because 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:02.369
 because here it doesn't work here 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.990
 8 0 3 2014 year

 you must give them this hotel 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.140
 previously this object was positioned under 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.119
 the world hotel brand radisson 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.520
 networks that had to pass in

 2011, we did not work on 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.000
 investor place came the business center 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.950
 Stalin most private enterprise come from 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.709
 not only to complete the complex manage 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.440
 they can make a beautiful object of him 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.480
 fine do prepare well if 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.390
 operating personnel will 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 and preparation everything looks absolutely all 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.290
 slave that the main claim to us 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.120
 In general, by and large, and all that 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.850
 what are the lossy features including 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 hotel fund is people c staff 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.840
 who say so is not ready to serve 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.150
 chewing those guests to us 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.030
 eats everyone thinks they are at work 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.940
 how could they not chew the service 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.760
 she 's a seal this is a killing problem 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.410
 and we try to fight something in 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.690
 micro district you like to talk about 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.400
 housing construction 77 distressed 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.650
 houses in Minsk by December should have been 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.140
 surrender 58 de facto readiness 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.549
 signed 48 to the first Julia gene 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.709
 contractors promise to pay by 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.360
 the remaining 15 long-standing and start as 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.810
 says to live on new building 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.019
 there are no unsolvable rules 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.640
 its in the beginning here in the summer when still 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.530
 issues were addressed and in general 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.810
 it was difficult to formulate even yourself 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.590
 approaches how to get to those houses by 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.870
 which let's say 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.069
 customers failed 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.220
 contractors are not capable designers 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.790
 unqualified 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.970
 in general, it is now mostly 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.040
 fundamentally , all these issues are resolved and 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.330
 even regulatory problems 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.030
 financial relationships with people where 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.709
 generally quite a subtle matter for 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.590
 a person must pay exactly that much 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.170
 how much he has to pay here to pay 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.700
 black is obliged here from another country with 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.069
 a person cannot be demanded more than that 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.510
 by law you know the meeting on 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.459
 her perfection and the construction industry 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.069
 continued in the city hall in the hall 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.090
 all participants in the construction process 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.130
 designers uks and construction 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.079
 companies including delinquent Th 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.930
 objects do not leave the list of protracted 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.000
 on some objects you can see how when 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
 spend to see how they are performed 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.859
 errands as managers 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.209
 contracting organizations 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.199
 perceive these assignments and how they them 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.610
 perform it can be seen from the reports and because 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.010
 relation to the construction of the object 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.590
 which is visible every day and unfortunately 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.820
 I want to say that on some objects 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.960
 commercial organizations work more 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.400
 effectively and carry out those errands 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.760
 sometimes with more so to speak 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.639
 responsibility than my colleagues who 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.780
 work in public funds in

 post after all pay for errors from this 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.979
