00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
saw for where they gave a really low

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.399 
saw for where they gave a really low
score<00:03:44.209> because<00:03:44.449> they<00:03:44.659> didn't<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.019> playing

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
score because they didn't like playing

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.110 
score because they didn't like playing
the<00:03:45.560> bad<00:03:45.709> guy<00:03:45.739> they<00:03:46.220> didn't<00:03:46.459> feel<00:03:46.639> like<00:03:46.879> how

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
the bad guy they didn't feel like how

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.879 
the bad guy they didn't feel like how
they<00:03:47.239> felt<00:03:47.509> being<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.259> bad<00:03:48.409> guy<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.799> I'm<00:03:48.859> like

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
they felt being the bad guy and I'm like

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.110 
they felt being the bad guy and I'm like
you<00:03:49.400> know<00:03:49.459> that's<00:03:49.639> actually<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.000> very

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
you know that's actually a very

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.759 
you know that's actually a very
respectable<00:03:50.599> stance<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.259> game<00:03:51.409> I<00:03:51.590> guess

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
respectable stance on the game I guess

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.860 
respectable stance on the game I guess
the<00:03:51.919> games<00:03:52.069> nine<00:03:52.579> out<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.819> ten<00:03:53.120> ten<00:03:53.449> out<00:03:53.599> of<00:03:53.629> ten

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
the games nine out of ten ten out of ten

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.449 
the games nine out of ten ten out of ten
nine<00:03:53.930> point<00:03:54.409> nine<00:03:54.620> out<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.799> ten<00:03:55.069> it's<00:03:55.280> almost

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
nine point nine out of ten it's almost

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.800 
nine point nine out of ten it's almost
just<00:03:55.609> like<00:03:55.669> you<00:03:55.879> know<00:03:56.000> what<00:03:56.150> didn't<00:03:56.719> like

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
being the bad guy one might think that I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.610 
being the bad guy one might think that I
wrote<00:03:59.479> that<00:03:59.659> review<00:03:59.810> but<00:04:00.079> I<00:04:00.139> love<00:04:00.349> being<00:04:00.469> the

for<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.310> title<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.790> doesn't<00:05:08.000> mean<00:05:08.120> anything

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
for a title that doesn't mean anything

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.270 
for a title that doesn't mean anything
because<00:05:08.510> it's<00:05:08.750> fake<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.290> then<00:05:10.040> there's<00:05:10.220> a

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280

because it's fake and then there's a
video<00:05:10.580> game<00:05:10.850> about<00:05:10.880> this<00:05:11.500> why<00:05:12.500> are<00:05:12.560> people

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
video game about this why are people

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.070

spending<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.250> time<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.550> this<00:05:13.910> I<00:05:14.210> remember<00:05:14.900> one

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
spending the time on this I remember one

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.620 
spending the time on this I remember one
time<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.590> was<00:05:15.950> playing<00:05:16.070> a<00:05:16.310> ladder<00:05:16.520> match<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:17.090> it

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
time I was playing a ladder match and it

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.090 
time I was playing a ladder match and it
should<00:05:17.870> have<00:05:17.960> been<00:05:18.020> easy<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.590> beat<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.070> shit

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
should have been easy I beat the shit

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.950 
should have been easy I beat the shit
out<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.490> everyone<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.300> I'm<00:05:20.390> climbing<00:05:20.780> up<00:05:20.840> the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
out of everyone and I'm climbing up the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.480 
out of everyone and I'm climbing up the
ladder<00:05:21.140> but<00:05:21.229> every<00:05:21.590> time<00:05:21.740> they<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.100> would<00:05:22.310> just

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
ladder but every time they I would just

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.400 
ladder but every time they I would just
knock<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.180> ladder<00:05:23.389> away<00:05:23.630> no<00:05:23.930> matter<00:05:24.080> what

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
knock the ladder away no matter what

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.900 
knock the ladder away no matter what
they<00:05:24.800> could<00:05:24.950> be<00:05:25.040> all<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.370> way<00:05:25.490> out<00:05:25.520> of<00:05:25.850> the

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
they could be all the way out of the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.670 
they could be all the way out of the
ring<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.330> then<00:05:26.690> they<00:05:26.780> come<00:05:26.990> back<00:05:27.020> in<00:05:27.290> and<00:05:27.500> the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
ring and then they come back in and the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.310 
ring and then they come back in and the
AI<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:27.979> stupid<00:05:28.760> it<00:05:29.300> just<00:05:29.570> bothers<00:05:30.110> me

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
AI is stupid it just bothers me

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.530 
AI is stupid it just bothers me
everything<00:05:30.860> about<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.130> game<00:05:31.520> sucks<00:05:32.000> the

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
everything about that game sucks the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.300 
everything about that game sucks the
only<00:05:32.870> good<00:05:33.020> thing<00:05:33.260> about<00:05:33.290> it<00:05:33.650> is<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.770> creative

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
only good thing about it is a creative

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.560 
only good thing about it is a creative
character<00:05:34.729> because<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.240> can<00:05:35.419> make

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
character because you can make

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.469 
character because you can make
characters<00:05:36.320> as<00:05:36.530> derpy<00:05:37.100> as<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.850> think<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.240> fans

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
characters as derpy as I think the fans

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.659 
characters as derpy as I think the fans
of<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.840> game<00:05:39.050> probably<00:05:39.380> are<00:05:39.860> other<00:05:40.160> games

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
of that game probably are other games

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.690 
of that game probably are other games
that<00:05:41.090> people<00:05:41.870> like<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.530> didn't<00:05:42.890> let's<00:05:43.039> how

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
that people like that I didn't let's how

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.159 
that people like that I didn't let's how
about<00:05:43.850> terraria<00:05:44.390> kind<00:05:44.690> of<00:05:44.750> found<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:45.050> out

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
about terraria kind of found that out

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.250 
about terraria kind of found that out
the<00:05:45.200> hard<00:05:45.350> way<00:05:45.710> everyone<00:05:46.640> loves<00:05:47.300> terraria<00:05:47.990> not

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
the hard way everyone loves terraria not

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.740 
the hard way everyone loves terraria not
sure<00:05:48.440> why<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:49.820> controls<00:05:50.210> seemed<00:05:50.510> really

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
sure why the controls seemed really

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.200 
sure why the controls seemed really
clunky<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.320> me<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:51.710> it<00:05:52.250> seemed<00:05:52.550> too<00:05:52.789> much<00:05:52.820> like

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
clunky to me and it seemed too much like

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.940 
clunky to me and it seemed too much like
a<00:05:53.240> 2d<00:05:53.630> Minecraft<00:05:54.110> it's<00:05:54.229> like<00:05:54.410> let's<00:05:54.800> go

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
a 2d Minecraft it's like let's go

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.279 
explore this randomly generated world
but<00:05:57.740> only<00:05:58.160> in<00:05:58.610> two<00:05:59.300> dimensions<00:05:59.810> let's<00:06:00.080> not

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
but only in two dimensions let's not

but only in two dimensions let's not
let's<00:06:00.830> not<00:06:01.039> add<00:06:01.190> that<00:06:01.430> third<00:06:01.640> dimension<00:06:01.789> in

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
let's not add that third dimension in

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.850 
let's not add that third dimension in
there<00:06:02.450> that's<00:06:02.720> that's<00:06:03.050> would<00:06:03.410> be<00:06:03.440> too<00:06:03.680> many

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
there that's that's would be too many

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.770 
there that's that's would be too many
dimensions<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.729> I<00:06:05.030> don't<00:06:05.090> know<00:06:05.270> it<00:06:05.450> seemed

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
dimensions and I don't know it seemed

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.420 
dimensions and I don't know it seemed
like<00:06:05.900> it<00:06:06.020> was<00:06:06.110> going<00:06:06.350> for<00:06:06.740> that<00:06:06.800> old<00:06:07.130> timey

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
like it was going for that old timey

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.159 
like it was going for that old timey
retro<00:06:07.910> feel<00:06:08.150> but<00:06:08.450> it<00:06:08.750> felt<00:06:08.960> like<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.140> was

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
retro feel but it felt like it was

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.620 
retro feel but it felt like it was
trying<00:06:09.530> way<00:06:09.800> too<00:06:09.830> hard<00:06:10.039> I'm<00:06:10.460> like<00:06:10.640> good<00:06:11.390> make

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
trying way too hard I'm like good make

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.870 
trying way too hard I'm like good make
graphics<00:06:12.080> a<00:06:12.320> little<00:06:12.350> better<00:06:12.770> than<00:06:13.010> this<00:06:13.190> no<00:06:13.610> I

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
graphics a little better than this no I

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.790 
graphics a little better than this no I
know<00:06:14.330> it's<00:06:14.720> probably<00:06:15.050> a<00:06:15.080> really<00:06:15.110> deep<00:06:15.500> game

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
know it's probably a really deep game

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.409 
know it's probably a really deep game
and<00:06:16.070> probably<00:06:16.430> if<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.550> put<00:06:16.970> enough<00:06:17.180> time<00:06:17.360> into

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
and probably if I put enough time into

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.240 
and probably if I put enough time into
it<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.960> would<00:06:18.380> love<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:18.740> or<00:06:18.860> whatever<00:06:19.039> I

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
it I would love it or whatever I

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.219 
it I would love it or whatever I
eventually<00:06:19.970> came<00:06:20.210> to<00:06:20.360> like<00:06:20.600> Minecraft<00:06:20.990> even

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
eventually came to like Minecraft even

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.570 
eventually came to like Minecraft even
though<00:06:21.289> my<00:06:21.410> first<00:06:21.620> impression<00:06:22.010> of<00:06:22.070> it<00:06:22.220> was<00:06:22.340> bad

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
though my first impression of it was bad

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.700 
though my first impression of it was bad
