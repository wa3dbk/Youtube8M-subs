challenging<00:04:48.289> for<00:04:48.560> me<00:04:48.800> in<00:04:48.860> certain<00:04:49.220> aspects

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
challenging for me in certain aspects

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.550 
challenging for me in certain aspects
whether<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.570> be<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.780> see<00:04:50.960> whether<00:04:51.229> it<00:04:51.350> be<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
whether it be the see whether it be the

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.320 
whether it be the see whether it be the
film<00:04:51.770> itself<00:04:52.039> and<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.669> think<00:04:52.699> for<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.060> film

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
film itself and I think for this film

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
film itself and I think for this film
itself<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.750> something<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.199> I've<00:04:54.289> always

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
itself is something that I've always

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.230 
itself is something that I've always
wanted<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.830> do<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.130> never<00:04:55.580> got<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:55.789> chance<00:04:55.850> to

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
wanted to do it never got a chance to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.070

to hopefully they'll bring to the table

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.469 
to hopefully they'll bring to the table
