00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.419
 good to everyone I am arctic and we are here 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.370
 in the new world tutorial on cue 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.639
 tutorial today we will learn to fly 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.570
 with the hang gliding much farther 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.530
 taking advantage of a book they have 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.959
 the bombs 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.349
 first let's see the distance that 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.910
 it came without using the bomb let's go 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.960
 directly with the hang glider from this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.269
 tree to see where we got 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.579
 As you can see I am dosing the stamina 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.429
 little by little so as not to lose too much height 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.800
 at once and keep me more or less 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.769
 same level in this way we 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.079
 we get as close as possible to 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.140
 the furthest zone that we have so 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.600
 As you can see we arrived right here next 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.579
 of the road just in this corner here 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.079
 which we have in this area as 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.089
 we have to stay with this because 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.590
 this is what we are going to spend in a 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.290
 moment 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.930
 we go back up in the same tree that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.700
 we were this here in this way the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.760
 results will be more accurate since 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.440
 We will see where we passed exactly in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 the place where we have stayed before 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.800
 so we put the bomb here in the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 edge and we wait for it to be about to 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.420
 explode now we open the delta wing and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 as you see, it does a little bit of damage 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 but the pump together with the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 explosion to this one that kills us because we 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.180
 gives a bit of a shock wave that we 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.010
 push this is not very clear if it is a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 book or if it's really going to be left like this 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.070
 but I think this is a book bang 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 they are going to take their time in 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.220
 fix it with guys we just spent 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.530
 right now where we had arrived and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 we still had half of this mine the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 half of this mine but we have spent a 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.890
 little or extra at the beginning but as you can see 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 we are coming much farther 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 I would say that up to three times further from 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.910
 what we had arrived and we are also 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.880
 as in a very superior height of what 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.920
 that we went before without the pump so 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 As you can see we are going to stay right here 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.700
 with this mushroom here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.620
 and it's just where we arrived with the wave 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.530
 expansive pump 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.590
 it is the truth a barbarity how far 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.240
 it is arrived thanks to this expansive wave 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.040
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.320
 remember to subscribe and you still are and 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.320
 see you in the next video bye bye
