00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
the natural fermentation processes so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.630 
the natural fermentation processes so
it's<00:00:45.769> called<00:00:46.250> sue<00:00:47.149> or<00:00:47.690> vinegar<00:00:48.199> in<00:00:48.800> Japanese

discussion just brown rice so that's the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.490 
discussion just brown rice so that's the
only<00:01:35.690> thing<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.980> had<00:01:37.250> been<00:01:37.520> used<00:01:38.510> in<00:01:38.990> order

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
to make this so it's naturally fermented

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.280 
to make this so it's naturally fermented
so<00:01:44.120> there<00:01:44.270> hasn't<00:01:44.450> been<00:01:44.630> everything<00:01:45.110> else

several stage
in<00:01:49.760> between<00:01:54.370> you've<00:01:55.370> got<00:01:56.260> who<00:01:57.260> may<00:01:57.560> soon<00:01:58.750> rice

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
in between you've got who may soon rice

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.790 
in between you've got who may soon rice
vinegar<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:01.210> when<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.390> look<00:02:02.690> at<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.470> side

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
vinegar and when you look at the side

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.180 
vinegar and when you look at the side
the<00:02:04.460> only<00:02:04.910> grain<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.570> rice<00:02:06.020> coming<00:02:06.740> but

alcohol<00:02:07.880> has<00:02:08.150> also<00:02:08.420> been<00:02:08.840> used<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:09.950> not<00:02:10.130> a

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
alcohol has also been used so it's not a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.790 
alcohol has also been used so it's not a
natural<00:02:10.550> fermentation<00:02:11.260> process<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800

it's<00:02:46.340> cold<00:02:46.880> rice<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.320> look<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
it's cold rice and when you look at the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.010 
it's cold rice and when you look at the
side<00:02:49.550> again<00:02:49.820> you'll<00:02:50.270> see<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.690> there's<00:02:50.900> only

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
side again you'll see that there's only

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.560 
side again you'll see that there's only
one<00:02:51.170> character<00:02:51.710> khoomei<00:02:52.520> it's<00:02:52.730> not<00:02:52.970> again<00:02:53.330> my

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
one character khoomei it's not again my

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.050 
one character khoomei it's not again my
ground<00:02:53.959> nice<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:54.860> rice<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.250> this

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
ground nice but it's just rice and this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.760 
ground nice but it's just rice and this
also<00:02:56.330> has<00:02:56.600> been<00:02:56.630> naturally<00:02:57.230> brewed

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
also has been naturally brewed

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.580 
also has been naturally brewed
so<00:02:58.280> what<00:02:58.700> visibly<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.260> biggest

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
so what visibly is the biggest

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.970 
so what visibly is the biggest
difference<00:03:00.980> between<00:03:01.100> two<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.470> what<00:03:03.739> does<00:03:03.950> that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
difference between two so what does that

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.880 
difference between two so what does that
mean<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:05.000> terms<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.080> ship<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.620> chef's

flavor and aroma of your gin might sue

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.400 
flavor and aroma of your gin might sue
with<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.730> fact<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.720> going<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:26.959> stain

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
with the fact that it's going to stain

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.770 
with the fact that it's going to stain
the<00:03:27.739> food<00:03:28.010> slightly<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.239> may<00:03:29.420> decide

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the food slightly and you may decide

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.540 
the food slightly and you may decide
instead<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.530> want<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.830> go<00:03:30.980> with<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.190> and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
instead you want to go with that and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.790 
instead you want to go with that and
also<00:03:32.150> look<00:03:32.600> at<00:03:32.750> even<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.080> difference<00:03:33.560> in

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
also look at even the difference in

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.000 
also look at even the difference in
terms<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.280> color<00:03:34.550> here<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:38.270> more

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
terms of color here so the more

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.240 
terms of color here so the more
adulterated<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.940> lighter<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.989> color<00:03:42.250> so

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
adulterated the lighter the color so

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.340 
adulterated the lighter the color so
sometimes<00:03:43.910> your<00:03:44.180> decision<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.230> be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
different color is the acidity so it

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.430 
different color is the acidity so it
actually<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.700> acidity<00:05:01.300> will<00:05:01.600> change<00:05:01.960> green

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
actually the acidity will change green

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.040 
actually the acidity will change green
and<00:05:02.770> make<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.070> brown<00:05:03.400> so<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.479> could<00:05:04.720> be<00:05:04.750> good

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
and make it brown so that could be good

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.900 
and make it brown so that could be good
or<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.229> could<00:05:05.470> not<00:05:05.650> be<00:05:05.800> good<00:05:05.950> depending<00:05:06.849> upon

or it could not be good depending upon
but<00:05:07.510> it<00:05:07.630> does<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:08.139> definitely<00:05:08.650> changes<00:05:09.250> the

but it does it definitely changes the
