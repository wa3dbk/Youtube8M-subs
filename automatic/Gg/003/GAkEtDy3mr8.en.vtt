00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to a new break news a 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.259
 technological news video from 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 and now there is more current than the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.980
 gebre all good many suppliers of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.630
 asking what happens with the yes of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.340
 when will he go out he makes a video 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.130
 explaining what happens in what state is 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 the jailbreak and good guys in this 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.100
 video more than anything two news from 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.949
 server because we do not have a Friday yet 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.630
 available for it is 8.3 good so 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 least I will expose my situation 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 I have not jailbroken for two months and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 I really believe that I do not need it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.870
 you're going to kill me enough to say how 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 you need it and you are a project if a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.200
 I love the tie-break and without tomorrow 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.969
 my wife was a jailbreak I would be 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 the second to do it surely the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.450
 first it would be javi bouquets of but good 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 guys the truth is that I have not done 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.680
 infant hare yes there are things that I 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.600
 I would like to have it not brought to us by Gilbert 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.690
 but the truth is that they are two little things 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.789
 counted for example not using the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.059
 home button for example I used auto 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.680
 3 and by gestures I could close applications 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.120
 could then go into multitasking or 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 well use tweets like the virtual 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 home to use touch aid and to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 not having to press the physical button that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.380
 nothing happens but really 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.479
 it gives us a lot of anger and not another thing that I've 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.670
 I miss a lot of nits it 's soft 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 selecting that to be able to interact with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.780
 the native keyboard eye not with flex and neither 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.640
 with stories the native keyboard that stops 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 I am the most comfortable and the best 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 implemented of all hey on that keyboard 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.939
 native meter is reflection to move the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 cursor making gestures with a finger 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.320
 today is really I think the panacea 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.630
 these are the two things that I miss the most 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.130
 minus the jailbreak surely 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.189
 they had and the bec would have as it comes 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 being usual 20 20 and peak twix but 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.909
 really the first one that I would install 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 would be these two and is that guys with the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.140
 arrival of ios 8 the jailbreak from my 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.610
 point of view is not so necessary I 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.069
 I would like to know your opinion guys 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.369
 but the truth is that in the 8th they brought 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:53.729
 third-party keyboards also brought the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.830
 extensions and brought the widgets of 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.920
 this way we will be able to improve 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.520
 the system a lot more we can 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.840
 customize it to have a few 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.789
 indicators in the center of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 notifications with the widgets 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.090
 we can change the keyboard if not you 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 like the native and we need another 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.780
 make it more productive for example with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.069
 flex and we can move the cursor with a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.920
 gesture in the space bar 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.290
 and also guys to me what I like the most 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.139
 is the subject of extensions because with 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.659
 they applications can be accessible 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.639
 from any other application through 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.590
 an extension simply with the button 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.810
 to share you go to the extension of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.400
 said application and you interact with it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.709
 This is great, I use for example 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.389
 very much the workflow application and I 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.939
 love because I have three or four 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.829
 very basic recipes but really to me 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.769
 they solve my life and open a 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.689
 incredible range of possibilities and already 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.819
 practically with the extensions he hears no 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.680
 we have no limitation of those that 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.780
 we miss at least 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.129
 comparing it with android was once in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.799
 8 years I think they have improved 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.680
 very much and have cut distances in 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.900
 that dose of let's say productivity 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.730
 that yes I had better flexibility 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.889
 said that he had android that he did not have 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.599
 This has improved a lot without 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.010
 need to have a jailbreak 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.169
 surely now you are wondering 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.169
 but good when a jailbreak in 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.359
 ios 8.3 that in which we have now not 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.909
 I told you a couple of weeks ago that 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.770
 the jailbreak in Aryan 28.4 was possible and 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.900
 that the hacker and onic 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.670
 and I have done in any case also 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 I anticipated that I nick has a this 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.320
 Exploit long and not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.960
 he releases his jailbreak and he continues 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.000
 maintaining those exploits we do not know if 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.010
 are the same as I had from yesteryear or if 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 are new ones what we do know is 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.810
 that I do not have has what nobody 8.4 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.520
 and almost certainly we are not going to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.530
 Qatar on the other hand guys would be a 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.740
 incredible loss that a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.830
 tie-break in ios 8.3 because it is imminent 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.900
 come out to ios 8.4 and this meant 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.960
 that if they take a jailbreak now in year 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.760
 is 8.4 support would close the exploits and the 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.370
 exploits are limited guys are not 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 infinities is not easy to find 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.880
 vulnerabilities to be able to attack and 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.070
 do the tie-break to the system then 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.250
 you have to use them cautiously as 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.260
 logical is to use them in ios 8.4 because 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.470
 surely it is the latest version of ios 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.110
 that we will see in ios 8 In addition 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.260
 devices that are not going to see ios 9 like 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.970
 they are the ipad2 or the iphone 4s 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.770
 practically no one doubts is a fact that 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.959
 these devices are going to stay in 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.440
 ios 8 and if we have any problems and 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.120
 we have 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.160
 and here we have to restore by the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.480
 reason that is the best that can be 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.550
 make a jailbreak in this last 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.530
 year version 28 so that these teams 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.420
 old ones, then, always have the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.460
 option to jailbreak with this 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.670
 latest version of ios 8 so guys 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.740
 most likely, up to 18.4 no 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.020
 come out a jailbreak that yes have for 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.630
 sure that the year will be your point 4 almost with 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.880
 all security 99.9 percent safe 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.200
 is going to leave a book guys nobody what 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.870
 I can assure you because you have to find 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.820
 the exploits and you have to attack about it and 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.800
 you have to liberalize the tool 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.060
 to do it of course but come on 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.940
 have no doubt that you are 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.860
 working on it and that nobody 28.4 almost 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.210
 sure we're going to have an ice like that 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.070
 that simply then have a little bit of 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.020
 patience that is missing quite a bit 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.880
 but in the face of my reflection I would like 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.280
 know what is your impression you have 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.530
 removed the jailbreak like me that you throw 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.480
 in lack you think that the time that they are 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.710
 so necessary I would like to know your 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.030
 opinion guys I hope you have 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.620
 liked the video that you support us 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.660
 composed I like you know see you 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.410
 in a next video goods in the code 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.410
