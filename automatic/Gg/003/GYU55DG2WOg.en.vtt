00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.480
 and it is triumph 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.480
 I'm bridge 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.240
 good yang the tie is alive 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.710
 nothing spray 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.040
 nothing without disguise 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.940
 hello start making a rectangle of 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 26 x 15 centimeters and cut out now is 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.350
 also a rectangle of 30 x 18 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.350
 centimeters and cut out 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.460
 in figure 1 we are going to make marks every 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.650
 12 centimeters and we will draw with a 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 line now with something to mark the 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.730
 folds we will retain the lines 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.890
 previously made to be able to bend 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.410
 more easily we also go with 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.840
 our scissors make a cut of this 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.030
 way in the tab that we should have 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.030
 stayed and we are simply going to fold 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.470
 now in figure 2 we are going to do 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.110
 marks every 14 centimeters and we're going to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.850
 trace with a line let's double the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.770
 creases and we're also going to make a 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.770
 cut same as the previous figure 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.680
 Now let's make two pieces of 17 x 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.140
 11 points 5 centimeters and 2 pieces of 21 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.400
 x 13.5 centimeters and we're going to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.890
 trim 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.870
 we must have four pieces how are you 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.480
 now to do the neck let's do 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.290
 a rectangle of 7 x 5 centimeters and what 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.290
 let's cut 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.540
 h 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.340
 me then you have it we are going to do 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.980
 marks to the centimeter on each side above 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.980
 and down and we're going to draw with a line 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.349
 we are also going to make the marks above 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.709
 and now we are going to trace there should have been something 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.930
 so now we just cut out of this 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.930
 way for our figure to be 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.050
 now in figure 1 we are going to mark a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.540
 line at 5 and 10 centimeters and with 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.860
 our cutter we are going to cut this 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.070
 It is so that our neck 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.520
 can fit more easily now 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.830
 we insert and we're just going to catch 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.330
 with stick glue and we're going to 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.080
 hit one of the walls of our 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.080
 card 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.760
 you can also do it like the antenna 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.100
 the robot is on and we're going to hit the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.220
 tab that you simply calculate how 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.150
 centimeters and we just finished 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.150
 close our card 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.400
 well now in figure 2 make sure that 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.470
 the tab that up and we're going to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.190
 finish hitting the neck we're going to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.780
 put glue on the tab and we're going to 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.630
 accommodate our figure is well 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.600
 centered let's stick the neck like 2 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.700
 centimeters and we're going to finish hitting 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.550
 now we simply insert our 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.440
 cards we must have a margin of 2 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.390
 centimeters in the figure above and a 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.760
 margin of 3 centimeters in figures 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.120
 below and here will be where you are going to draw 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.900
 the little ears and the little hands if 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.900
 do you want to do it 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.160
 h 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.600
 Now we are simply going to decorate for 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.610
 the little feet you can also do it 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.620
 same way you did with the neck is 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.220
 say that figure 2 you can do as 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.230
 margins and put the little feet so that 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.830
 be well married or do as I did 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.990
 that the strings stick from behind 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.300
 now I'm just decorating them 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.180
 with figures from the stapler and with 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.820
 Circles I made in cardboard buttons 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.040
 I also made this little heart made 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.760
 of cardboard to be able to put it as a 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.190
 dedication 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.970
 and that's all, and well, now 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.520
