we use a piece of equipment to touch
those<00:01:13.140> buttons<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.850> where

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
those buttons and we kind of know where

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.550 
those buttons and we kind of know where
they're<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.210> let's<00:01:15.810> say<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.200> operating

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560

patient on what the surgeons doing and
they<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.460> reach<00:01:20.610> over<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:20.939> hit<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> piece

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
they have to reach over and hit a piece

they have to reach over and hit a piece
of<00:01:21.390> equipment<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.140> can't<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> do

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
of equipment I can't look at it and I do

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
of equipment I can't look at it and I do
know<00:01:24.150> where<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.450> button<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
know where that button is that I need to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
know where that button is that I need to
hit<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> mechanical

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
hit now if that was the mechanical

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.120 
hit now if that was the mechanical
button<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:27.990> definitely<00:01:28.140> fill<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> by<00:01:28.950> its

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
button I could definitely fill it by its

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
button I could definitely fill it by its
shape<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> pressed<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.810> get

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
shape and now I pressed it because I get

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
shape and now I pressed it because I get
a<00:01:30.990> tactile<00:01:31.439> feedback<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.189> button

problem because with a visual indication
I<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> device<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> can't

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
I have to look at the device and I can't

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.380 
I have to look at the device and I can't
really<00:01:52.439> take<00:01:52.680> my<00:01:52.890> eyes<00:01:53.009> off<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> need

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
really take my eyes off of what I need

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.139 
really take my eyes off of what I need
to<00:01:54.780> focus<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.159> put<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> buzzer<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.969> there

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
to focus on if I put a buzzer in there

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
to focus on if I put a buzzer in there
and<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.450> an<00:01:57.540> environment<00:01:58.020> where<00:01:58.110> there's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and I'm in an environment where there's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
and I'm in an environment where there's
a<00:01:58.380> lot<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.649> noise<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.979> may<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.250> hear<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
a lot of noise that may not hear that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
a lot of noise that may not hear that
buzzer<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> things<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> we've

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
buzzer so one of the things that we've

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.069 
buzzer so one of the things that we've
looked<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.299> giving<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.930> good

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
looked into is a way of of giving a good

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.780 
looked into is a way of of giving a good
indication<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> easiest<00:02:05.280> way<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.549> do

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
indication and the easiest way to do

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.969 
indication and the easiest way to do
that<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.090> through<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.390> finger<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.829> have

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that is through your finger so if I have

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.410 
that is through your finger so if I have
a<00:02:08.009> piece<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.399> equipment<00:02:08.879> sitting<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> room

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
a piece of equipment sitting in a room

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
a piece of equipment sitting in a room
and<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.629> reach<00:02:09.989> over<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.379> touch<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.430> get

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and I reach over to touch that and I get

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.140 
and I reach over to touch that and I get
some<00:02:11.849> type<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> effect<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.810> couple

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
some type of effect a couple

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.300 
some type of effect a couple
bumps<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:13.540> my<00:02:13.569> finger<00:02:14.079> or<00:02:14.170> whatever<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.739> know<00:02:15.129> I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
bumps on my finger or whatever I know I

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.729 
bumps on my finger or whatever I know I
hit<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.790> button<00:02:16.060> now<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.019> problem<00:02:17.439> comes<00:02:17.620> in

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
hit that button now the problem comes in

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.410 
hit that button now the problem comes in
when<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.099> multiple<00:02:18.549> buttons<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.209> hit

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
when I have multiple buttons that I hit

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.569 
when I have multiple buttons that I hit
the<00:02:19.540> right<00:02:19.689> button<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.230> got<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.829> feedback<00:02:21.280> set<00:02:21.549> I

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
the right button I got a feedback set I

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.860 
the right button I got a feedback set I
hit<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.849> button<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.329> I<00:02:22.360> don't<00:02:22.569> know<00:02:22.629> if<00:02:22.720> I've

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
hit a button but I don't know if I've

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.619 
hit a button but I don't know if I've
actually<00:02:23.140> actuated<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.920> correct<00:02:24.189> one<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.480> we

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
actually actuated the correct one so we

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.210 
actually actuated the correct one so we
want<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.900> look<00:02:26.049> at<00:02:26.140> multiple<00:02:26.620> effects<00:02:26.950> each

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
want to look at multiple effects each

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.949 
want to look at multiple effects each
button<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.849> be<00:02:27.879> assigned<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.480> different<00:02:28.599> type
