00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.740
 to make an origami as she took 2 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 leaves because is identical in size 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.710
 for a quarter is two-tone 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.889
 you need a sheet of colors 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.889
 different 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.510
 first of all you have to fold the sheet on 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.070
 third for that either you can 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.040
 use a ruler to score well 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:31.790
 dairy or do like that which is the 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:35.750
 leaf is marked with a fold one goes 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.770
 check here it's not good so it 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.770
 must shift a little more 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.600
 we check it 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.120
 it's good we have a third 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300
 make the folds 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.320
 for the second time take the first 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.320
 leaf as a landmark 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.540
 now you have two papers with 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.100
 identical folds take it in and looted 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.570
 the tip at the top right on the side 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:16.460
 opposite to the triangle like this is the one 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:19.810
 from below in the other direction reproduce to 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.810
 the same on the other paper 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.090
 your two papers are ready 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.920
 this is the paper that you will put in 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.210
 below that will be the color that will remain 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:59.110
 below then start with foot the 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.640
 bottom paper like these and 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.180
 continue in the opposite direction 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.180
 Clockwise 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.340
 the last triangle issil orange must 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.440
 pass under the glass to make 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.710
 hold it all and finish your origami 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.710
 square
