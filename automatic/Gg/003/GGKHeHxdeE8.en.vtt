00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 do not tell me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.860
 peepers 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.390
 yes everyone welcome to car 5 to gta 5 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.919
 whatever you want to call it and well we are in 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.539
 a kind of career that I've got 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.369
 download me because I've been fighting 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.439
 a lot since I was very interested 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.720
 play strange maps that I had seen by 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.360
 there like from extreme racing tracks 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.120
 with ramps with loopings and all and for 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.460
 finally I have managed to put this 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.440
 kind of maps in the good gta you know 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.850
 that you simply have to so that 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.399
 know you have to go to social club to 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.649
 your social rockstar club you see 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.420
 you go to games and then you can download 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.820
 the activity also try to leave you 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.039
 a link because it's done from the pc and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.600
 then you have it in your gta on the console 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.609
 that is, they left the link directly 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.649
 that leads to this map that tries to leave 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.969
 this map you add that activity to your 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.559
 game you already have it directly for 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.120
 can play it good said this we are 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.760
 on a map called slippery when 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.620
 wet what it is and what it is like to live and I do not know what 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.479
 what it is but it is when you are wet or a 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.040
 mean better said and we have to do 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.750
 as a kind of career this would be 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.460
 it is very clear that it is playing with another 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.200
 person with subscribers with you 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.870
 I think I have thought it would be much more 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 fun but for now there is life 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.020
 only more than anything to teach you and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.300
 because I have not had way to power 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.640
 invite you to create it I write and others 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.350
 I have created in attitude with the lord 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 town called bears visits a kid 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.860
 to them and obet writes a very weird thing 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.870
 in fact I have to teach it so that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.100
 you can join and in this way you can 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.440
 invited this type of games that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.540
 I plan to organize and make careers 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.340
 with you in strange maps very 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.770
 pimps since only the host if the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 have you can do epic races and if 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.470
 more kids but with you a lot because 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.370
 this is part of new content that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 I want is in the channel that is 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.550
 races with you always try 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.930
 interact with you as much as possible 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.640
 we are not already here in this kind of 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.150
 track that we have that with our 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.650
 botillo trying to go through that 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.760
 water area crossing the river and it 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.290
 order the water that I 'm sure I 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.790
 have some ethical questions about everything 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.500
 because I do not handle very well with the command 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.600
 things and here we are we have come to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.520
 the area where the people subscribe 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.290
 they are legendary they have left the tico 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.810
 local and everything I have to do this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.910
 sort of semi and I know my ramp 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.020
 loop well weird let's turn up 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 we have to get somewhere else 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.210
 of a look happens with all this is 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.800
 complicated 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.000
 notice that the map is very cool and this 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.080
 you see that the people with the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.030
 map editor 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.920
 we are this would be very much with 22 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.920
 when you enter with jumping 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.680
 but because you get wet and if we're in 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.360
 winter in Spain you do not have the water 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.820
 we are now supported until the end 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.170
 because he knows that if the charge dry god 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.000
 my vale 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.320
 we have arrived an area in which we are going 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.770
 to have to fight enough to be able 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.770
 happen 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.180
 the quiet tour kira kira but not 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.830
 so much but here we are at the end 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.690
 all that the managers leave is 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.760
 as rector for the trick is like no 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.200
 To touch a lot in the water we are perfect 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.270
 I think it reaches the final zone but 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.920
 we stretch super good very much 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.060
 because there are a lot but a lot of 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.440
 water for this is one that is caught 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.610
 directly to throw to be able to 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.130
 comment what I plan to do 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.740
 with you I have seen the water I do not know 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.320
 if I can create another crisis mind I have 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.880
 to invite it to see if 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.560
 although from the had with Mr. camps 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.060
 that I also invited today to play 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.890
 but he said I do not have time verse I 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.260
 for now nothing happens and I said that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.980
 teach my people to my loves 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.980
 what you have 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.319
 because the bike stabilizes is now 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.730
 well you know that you're 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.010
 integrated in this type of maps you can 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.750
 try to push the links or bring the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.489
 strangest maps to the channel so that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.050
 You can download the sharks with 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.989
 your friends or with me and I'm going to the 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.209
 pool under the wall that can fall as 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.380
 crazy we are not going to see that jump is like 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.150
 a little common and in fact has given me for 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.660
 valid all the good thing would be to do it in 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.660
 first person 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.530
 we are entitled to spend that track of 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.170
 a famous person and see if it's over here 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.269
 youtube I want to get to the area 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.739
 of the jumps do it between the person 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.479
 that I think will be very very 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.479
 complicated in fact we can bÃ©tico 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.580
 it does not know what happened but I think 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.590
 I split what's going to be the skull 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.720
 he has also caught one of the bikes 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.650
 as well as they go a little strange the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.650
 zone is the time to go up there we are going to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.650
 drink 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.379
 I am being well thanks to me 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.379
 step to the first between a person 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.379
 like making a horse for 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.430
 the extremes and well I hope that these 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.630
 they like to see you already know that leaving 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430

 since I already passed it to fucking mother 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.970
 looking at the maps out there is pretty 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.580
 fun you are looking for strange things 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.310
 that I can show you everything that the gta 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.139
 always had a very strong support to me 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.500
 channel and it's something that I left because I could not 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.539
