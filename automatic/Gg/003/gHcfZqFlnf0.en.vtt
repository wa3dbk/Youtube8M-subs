the vegetables soaks up the granules and
turns<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.039> sauce<00:01:12.979> I<00:01:14.750> just<00:01:15.750> bone<00:01:15.990> these

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
turns it into a sauce I just bone these

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.890 
turns it into a sauce I just bone these
on<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:18.890> know<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> camera<00:01:20.360> maybe<00:01:21.360> want<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
on here I know the camera maybe want to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
on here I know the camera maybe want to
have<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
have some as well so that is just so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.240 
have some as well so that is just so
easy<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.439> probably<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:29.040> more<00:01:29.189> than

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
easy and I probably have a bit more than

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.859 
easy and I probably have a bit more than
that<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> plates<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.540> smaller

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that that's the plates is smaller

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.090 
that that's the plates is smaller
because<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> always<00:01:31.530> feel<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:31.860> you're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
because you always feel like you're

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770 
because you always feel like you're
having<00:01:32.340> more<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> smaller<00:01:33.030> plate<00:01:33.390> rather

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
having more on a smaller plate rather

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
having more on a smaller plate rather
than<00:01:33.900> losing<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> big<00:01:34.650> place<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.159> would

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
than losing on a big place I would

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.280 
than losing on a big place I would
probably<00:01:36.470> probably<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> half<00:01:38.369> again<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
probably probably that in half again and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.679 
probably probably that in half again and
you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.710> stuff<00:01:41.159> by<00:01:42.000> boiling<00:01:42.450> your

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you can make stuff by boiling your

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.920 
you can make stuff by boiling your
vegetables<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.240> deciding<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.869> I'm

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
vegetables and deciding what so I'm

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.749 
vegetables and deciding what so I'm
going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.350> grainy<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> sauce<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.549> put

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
going to use grainy as a sauce just put

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
going to use grainy as a sauce just put
it<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> water<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> boiling

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.490 
it in there because the water is boiling
it<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:49.710> melt<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.100> straight<00:01:50.399> away<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it will melt it straight away if you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649
