00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.450
 He sends his strengths 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.010
 rank 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.520
 would be considered 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 like 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.140
 Not 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.399
 if someone writes the EDA 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.799
 Well, that's how I am 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.379

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.719
 I enjoyed that a lot 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.330
 it was a new experience for me 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.620
 and I hope 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.150
 I have also developed something "within this 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.800
 The last one was the first and that is a bit too 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 practice there are two to settle 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.050
 and 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:33.809
 or was a very nice game 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.259

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.259

 so many areas the yachts sleep everything is in it 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.650
 both the complete arena of value 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.520
 I hope 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.189

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.949

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.740

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.469

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.729

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:54.659
