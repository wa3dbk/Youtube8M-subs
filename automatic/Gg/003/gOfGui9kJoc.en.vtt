a lot about this and other coverage of
this<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.910> talked<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.079> with<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
this and I talked about it with the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.330 
this and I talked about it with the
creators<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.180> heavily

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
creators that this is just so heavily

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.759 
creators that this is just so heavily
influenced<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.579> know<00:03:44.700> by<00:03:45.030> Asian<00:03:45.420> culture<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
influenced you know by Asian culture and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.289 
influenced you know by Asian culture and
it's<00:03:46.950> getting<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.340> not<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:47.609> much<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:47.910> as

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
it's getting to be not so much just as

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.849 
it's getting to be not so much just as
you<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.660> style<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.440> with<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.739> know

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
you know in style and with you know

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.770 
you know in style and with you know
certain<00:03:50.370> fighting<00:03:51.030> elements<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.600> things

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
certain fighting elements and things

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300 
certain fighting elements and things
like<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.829> it's<00:03:52.980> always<00:03:53.100> had

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
like that and it's always had

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.099 
like that and it's always had
philosophical<00:03:53.579> elements<00:03:54.359> as<00:03:54.450> well<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:55.049> I

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
philosophical elements as well but I

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.809 
philosophical elements as well but I
think<00:03:55.200> for<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.560> first<00:03:55.620> time<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.459> series

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
think for the first time the series

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.759 
think for the first time the series
seems<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.359> you<00:03:57.840> know<00:03:57.959> instead<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.319> having<00:03:58.530> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
seems to be you know instead of having a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.830 
seems to be you know instead of having a
balanced<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.459> seems<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.090> be<00:04:00.120> tipping<00:04:00.540> more<00:04:00.720> in

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
balanced it seems to be tipping more in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.470 
balanced it seems to be tipping more in
the<00:04:00.959> favor<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.489> Asian<00:04:02.489> culture<00:04:02.880> which<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.269> fine

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the favor of Asian culture which is fine

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.970 
the favor of Asian culture which is fine
with<00:04:03.690> me<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:04.049> think<00:04:04.470> that's<00:04:04.590> very<00:04:04.680> interesting

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
with me I think that's very interesting

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.610 
with me I think that's very interesting
but<00:04:05.730> I'm<00:04:06.030> curious<00:04:06.359> as<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.810> what<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.049> will<00:04:07.139> do<00:04:07.290> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
but I'm curious as to what it will do to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.920 
but I'm curious as to what it will do to
the<00:04:07.889> show<00:04:08.069> as<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.430> whole<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.420> everyone<00:04:09.690> will

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
the show as a whole and if everyone will

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.420

be<00:04:10.049> able<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.290> go<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.799> ride<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.220> that

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
be able to go on the ride like that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.490
