00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.509 
you're getting double light on that side
you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.470> move<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.769> light<00:02:29.980> back<00:02:30.130> over<00:02:30.400> to

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
you can move this light back over to

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.040 
you can move this light back over to
here<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:31.330> I'm<00:02:31.450> picking<00:02:31.599> up<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.810> cooler

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
here so now I'm picking up a cooler

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.509 
here so now I'm picking up a cooler
light<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.650> side<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.160> want<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> adjust

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
light on this side if I want to adjust

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.280 
light on this side if I want to adjust
the<00:02:33.790> intensity<00:02:34.030> your<00:02:34.569> light<00:02:34.780> will<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.050> under

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
the intensity your light will be under

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.110 
the intensity your light will be under
your<00:02:35.319> sky<00:02:35.590> tab<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.220> select<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.000> have

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
your sky tab just select it and you have

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.640 
your sky tab just select it and you have
a<00:02:37.150> brightness<00:02:37.450> tab<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.019> can<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.410> you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
a brightness tab so you can really you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.259 
a brightness tab so you can really you
know<00:02:38.680> blow<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.040> guy<00:02:39.250> out<00:02:39.430> your<00:02:39.700> radius<00:02:40.120> is

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
know blow this guy out your radius is

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.210 
know blow this guy out your radius is
going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> volume<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.890> larger

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
going to be like a volume so the larger

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.710 
going to be like a volume so the larger
your<00:02:42.340> radius<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> larger<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> volume<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.629> if

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
your radius the larger the volume so if

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.539 
your radius the larger the volume so if
I<00:02:43.780> crank<00:02:44.019> up<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.709> if<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.860> drop<00:02:45.069> my<00:02:45.099> radius

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
I crank up this and if I drop my radius

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.979 
I crank up this and if I drop my radius
you<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:46.000> how<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.299> going<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.630> affect

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
you can see how it's going to affect

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.089 
you can see how it's going to affect
that<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.319> usually<00:02:47.560> don't<00:02:47.620> feel<00:02:47.799> with<00:02:47.950> my

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
that I usually don't feel with my

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.650 
that I usually don't feel with my
attenuation<00:02:48.790> too<00:02:48.910> much<00:02:49.120> unless<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.510> just

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
attenuation too much unless I'm just

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.509 
attenuation too much unless I'm just
trying<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.019> fine-tune<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.829> little<00:02:50.980> bit<00:02:51.160> this

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
trying to fine-tune it a little bit this

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.610 
trying to fine-tune it a little bit this
guy<00:02:51.670> size<00:02:52.299> softness<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.170> know<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.440> kind

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
guy size softness you know I just kind

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.569 
guy size softness you know I just kind
of<00:02:53.650> use<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.920> soften<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> light<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.489> little

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
of use it to soften the light a little

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.640 
of use it to soften the light a little
bit<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:54.970> becomes<00:02:55.030> more<00:02:55.420> diffused<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> have

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
bit it becomes more diffused if you have

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.170 
bit it becomes more diffused if you have
a<00:02:56.680> spotlight<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.610> change<00:02:57.849> it<00:02:57.940> right<00:02:58.060> now

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
a spotlight you can change it right now

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.610 
a spotlight you can change it right now
so<00:02:58.360> directional<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.019> I'd<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> leave<00:02:59.530> it

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
so directional so I'd like to leave it

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.830 
so directional so I'd like to leave it
as<00:02:59.709> directional<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.579> go<00:03:00.700> back<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:01.329> can

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
as directional and if I go back I can

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.050 
as directional and if I go back I can
create<00:03:02.170> another<00:03:02.829> light<00:03:03.099> if<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.370> want<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
create another light if I want and the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.520 
create another light if I want and the
same<00:03:04.209> process<00:03:04.569> if<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.780> want<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.019> delete<00:03:05.140> it's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
same process if I want to delete it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.380 
same process if I want to delete it's
just<00:03:05.739> select<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> light<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.849> delete<00:03:07.239> if<00:03:07.329> you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
just select the light and delete if you

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.789 
just select the light and delete if you
want<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.690> change<00:03:07.900> your<00:03:08.019> background<00:03:08.170> image<00:03:08.530> you

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
want to change your background image you

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.319 
want to change your background image you
go<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.069> your<00:03:09.220> presets<00:03:09.579> that<00:03:09.849> I'm<00:03:10.060> one<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.239> you

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
go to your presets that I'm one of you

go to your presets that I'm one of you
using<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.110> smashed<00:03:11.709> windows<00:03:12.099> we<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.489> rotate

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
using the smashed windows we just rotate

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.370 
using the smashed windows we just rotate
and<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.090> brightness<00:03:13.360> rotate<00:03:13.750> till<00:03:13.900> we<00:03:14.049> get<00:03:14.230> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
and that brightness rotate till we get a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.140 
and that brightness rotate till we get a
lighting<00:03:14.739> similar<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.610> know<00:03:15.700> what<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:15.910> want

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
lighting similar to you know what I want

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.910 
lighting similar to you know what I want
to<00:03:16.239> see<00:03:16.389> here<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.870> we'll<00:03:17.049> go<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.319> way<00:03:17.500> what

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
to see here so we'll go that way what

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.559 
to see here so we'll go that way what
rotate<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.340> head<00:03:18.519> once<00:03:18.790> again<00:03:19.000> moving<00:03:19.299> around

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
rotate is head once again moving around

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.170

is alt left click right click and you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.490 
is alt left click right click and you
can<00:03:22.299> zoom<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.750> like<00:03:22.840> Maya<00:03:23.109> so<00:03:23.410> if

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
can zoom in it just like Maya so if

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.110 
can zoom in it just like Maya so if
you're<00:03:23.620> familiar<00:03:23.769> with<00:03:24.010> Maya<00:03:24.310> same<00:03:24.790> key

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
you're familiar with Maya same key

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.420 
you're familiar with Maya same key
functions<00:03:25.540> okay<00:03:26.079> now<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.350> rendering<00:03:27.130> you

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
functions okay now for rendering you

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.860 
functions okay now for rendering you
want<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.700> turn<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:28.000> ambient<00:03:28.420> occlusion<00:03:28.540> this

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
want to turn on ambient occlusion this

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.449 
want to turn on ambient occlusion this
is<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.470> screen<00:03:29.980> based<00:03:30.190> ami

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
is going to be screen based ami

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.559 
is going to be screen based ami
inclusion<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:30.910> you're<00:03:31.060> actually<00:03:31.150> going<00:03:31.389> to<00:03:31.480> be

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
inclusion so you're actually going to be

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.330 
inclusion so you're actually going to be
getting<00:03:31.720> geo<00:03:32.019> occluding<00:03:32.620> itself<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.220> can

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
getting geo occluding itself you can

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.770 
getting geo occluding itself you can
adjust<00:03:33.639> a<00:03:33.730> strength<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.299> can<00:03:34.450> adjust

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
adjust a strength and you can adjust

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.870 
adjust a strength and you can adjust
your<00:03:34.870> size<00:03:35.530> now<00:03:35.799> let's<00:03:36.069> try<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.790> an

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
your size now let's try to get an

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.190 
your size now let's try to get an
occlusion<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.510> know<00:03:37.600> around<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.019> eyes<00:03:38.170> and

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
occlusion you know around the eyes and

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.960 
occlusion you know around the eyes and
stuff<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:39.310> actually<00:03:39.639> creating<00:03:39.940> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
stuff so that it's actually creating a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.940 
stuff so that it's actually creating a
nice<00:03:40.120> occlusion<00:03:40.600> around<00:03:40.810> eyes<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.290> other<00:03:41.380> geo

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
nice occlusion around eyes and other geo

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.220 
nice occlusion around eyes and other geo
this<00:03:42.280> around<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.359> mesh<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> scarf<00:03:44.139> I
