00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
here so you got to make sure that

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.210 
here so you got to make sure that
selected<00:05:27.280> space<00:05:28.080> doesn't<00:05:29.080> exceed<00:05:29.560> free<00:05:29.950> space

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
selected space doesn't exceed free space

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.970 
selected space doesn't exceed free space
right<00:05:31.150> now<00:05:31.270> it's<00:05:31.480> over<00:05:31.900> because<00:05:32.530> I<00:05:32.680> already

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
right now it's over because I already

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.220 
right now it's over because I already
created<00:05:33.220> your<00:05:33.460> arm<00:05:33.670> slot<00:05:33.910> so<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.690> more<00:05:34.870> space

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
created your arm slot so the more space

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.960 
created your arm slot so the more space
you<00:05:35.440> use<00:05:35.470> for<00:05:35.920> a<00:05:35.950> round<00:05:36.160> slot<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.550> less<00:05:36.760> you

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
you use for a round slot the less you

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.060 
you use for a round slot the less you
have<00:05:37.210> for<00:05:37.600> other<00:05:37.840> ones<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.500> you<00:05:38.560> are<00:05:38.770> able<00:05:38.980> to

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
have for other ones so you are able to

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.980 
have for other ones so you are able to
have<00:05:39.280> four<00:05:39.760> different<00:05:39.970> ROM<00:05:40.360> slots<00:05:40.720> in

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
have four different ROM slots in

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.780 
have four different ROM slots in
addition<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.710> stock<00:05:41.980> one<00:05:42.190> but<00:05:42.520> just

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
addition to the stock one but just

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.570 
addition to the stock one but just
remember<00:05:43.150> that<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.990> more<00:05:44.200> space<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.650> use<00:05:44.680> for

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
remember that the more space you use for

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.310 
remember that the more space you use for
one<00:05:45.730> round<00:05:45.880> slot<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.330> less<00:05:46.570> room<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:46.990> have<00:05:47.140> to

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
one round slot the less room you have to

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.170 
one round slot the less room you have to
make<00:05:47.470> others<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:48.580> once<00:05:48.760> you're<00:05:48.880> done<00:05:48.910> using

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
make others so once you're done using

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.870 
make others so once you're done using
the<00:05:49.450> size<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:50.170> can<00:05:50.320> go<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.560> create<00:05:51.160> rom<00:05:51.550> spot

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
the size you can go to create rom spot

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.540 
the size you can go to create rom spot
and<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.320> will<00:05:53.320> take<00:05:53.440> about<00:05:53.650> five<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.340> ten

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
and that will take about five to ten

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.460 
and that will take about five to ten
minutes<00:05:54.580> so<00:05:55.510> once<00:05:55.660> it's<00:05:55.810> done<00:05:55.960> make<00:05:56.170> sure<00:05:56.320> the

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
minutes so once it's done make sure the

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.010 
minutes so once it's done make sure the
slot<00:05:56.740> is<00:05:56.920> active<00:05:57.640> if<00:05:58.000> not<00:05:58.480> just<00:05:58.780> press

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
slot is active if not just press

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.990 
slot is active if not just press
activate<00:05:59.550> and<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:01.840> will<00:06:01.960> say<00:06:02.350> ROM<00:06:03.250> slot<00:06:03.520> one<00:06:03.820> in

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
activate and it will say ROM slot one in

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.780 
activate and it will say ROM slot one in
green<00:06:04.600> at<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.900> top<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.350> now<00:06:06.040> we<00:06:06.100> can<00:06:06.400> install

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
green at the top and now we can install

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.760 
green at the top and now we can install
our<00:06:07.000> custom<00:06:07.510> ROM<00:06:07.690> if<00:06:07.900> it's<00:06:08.200> your<00:06:08.350> first<00:06:08.560> time

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
our custom ROM if it's your first time

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.340 
our custom ROM if it's your first time
using<00:06:09.040> a<00:06:09.250> particular<00:06:10.000> ROM<00:06:10.330> slot<00:06:10.630> then<00:06:10.960> you<00:06:11.200> can

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
using a particular ROM slot then you can

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.880 
using a particular ROM slot then you can
just<00:06:11.650> go<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:12.490> install<00:06:13.270> if<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:14.110> are<00:06:14.230> reusing<00:06:14.800> a

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
just go to install if you are reusing a

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.860 
just go to install if you are reusing a
slot<00:06:15.160> maybe<00:06:15.580> you<00:06:15.760> tried<00:06:16.030> out<00:06:16.180> one<00:06:16.210> custom<00:06:16.690> ROM

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
slot maybe you tried out one custom ROM

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.080 
slot maybe you tried out one custom ROM
and<00:06:17.080> didn't<00:06:17.680> really<00:06:17.890> like<00:06:18.070> it<00:06:18.310> then<00:06:18.670> you<00:06:18.700> want

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
and didn't really like it then you want

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.760 
and didn't really like it then you want
to<00:06:19.120> try<00:06:19.240> another<00:06:19.360> one<00:06:19.540> then<00:06:19.870> you're<00:06:20.590> going<00:06:20.710> to

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
to try another one then you're going to

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.360 
to try another one then you're going to
have<00:06:20.890> to<00:06:21.010> wipe<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.460> so<00:06:21.910> make<00:06:22.270> sure<00:06:22.300> it's<00:06:22.570> active

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
have to wipe it so make sure it's active

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.600 
have to wipe it so make sure it's active
then<00:06:24.370> go<00:06:24.640> to<00:06:24.700> wipe<00:06:24.970> and<00:06:25.930> then<00:06:26.620> just<00:06:27.040> swipe<00:06:27.370> this

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
then go to wipe and then just swipe this

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.120 
then go to wipe and then just swipe this
to<00:06:27.910> the<00:06:28.000> right<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.360> do<00:06:29.230> a<00:06:29.260> complete<00:06:29.650> wipe<00:06:29.830> and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
to the right to do a complete wipe and

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.650 
to the right to do a complete wipe and
you'll<00:06:30.400> have<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.550> clean<00:06:30.820> slate<00:06:31.030> to<00:06:31.180> work<00:06:31.480> with

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
you'll have a clean slate to work with

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.930 
you'll have a clean slate to work with
but<00:06:32.230> if<00:06:32.350> you<00:06:32.440> just<00:06:32.650> made<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.919> slot<00:06:33.190> then<00:06:33.520> you

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
but if you just made the slot then you

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.970 
but if you just made the slot then you
have<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:34.150> do<00:06:34.270> that<00:06:34.450> so<00:06:35.200> just<00:06:35.440> go<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.590> install

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
have to do that so just go to install

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.530 
have to do that so just go to install
and<00:06:36.310> here<00:06:36.610> we're<00:06:36.700> going<00:06:36.790> to<00:06:36.880> choose<00:06:37.030> our<00:06:37.240> zip

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
and here we're going to choose our zip

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.900 
and here we're going to choose our zip
file<00:06:37.780> so<00:06:38.050> the<00:06:38.410> custom<00:06:38.680> round<00:06:38.830> I'm<00:06:39.010> using<00:06:39.310> for

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
file so the custom round I'm using for

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.080 
file so the custom round I'm using for
this<00:06:40.030> demonstration<00:06:40.690> is<00:06:41.200> called<00:06:41.440> venomous<00:06:42.090> so

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
this demonstration is called venomous so

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.810 
this demonstration is called venomous so
that's<00:06:43.270> the<00:06:43.420> zip<00:06:43.600> file<00:06:43.840> and<00:06:44.310> we<00:06:45.310> also<00:06:45.460> have<00:06:45.700> to

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
that's the zip file and we also have to

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.940 
that's the zip file and we also have to
flash<00:06:46.060> that<00:06:46.330> kernel<00:06:46.780> module<00:06:47.140> so<00:06:47.470> go<00:06:47.710> to<00:06:47.770> add

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
flash that kernel module so go to add

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.090 
flash that kernel module so go to add
more<00:06:48.100> zips<00:06:48.400> and<00:06:48.870> then<00:06:49.870> that's<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.650> module<00:06:51.010> is

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
more zips and then that's the module is

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.390 
more zips and then that's the module is
it<00:06:51.280> and<00:06:51.990> let's<00:06:52.990> make<00:06:53.110> sure<00:06:53.290> you<00:06:53.860> got<00:06:53.980> two<00:06:54.160> files

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
it and let's make sure you got two files

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.370 
it and let's make sure you got two files
in<00:06:54.580> there<00:06:54.760> also<00:06:55.510> make<00:06:55.840> sure<00:06:55.870> to<00:06:55.990> read<00:06:56.230> the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
in there also make sure to read the

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.080 
in there also make sure to read the
directions<00:06:56.830> for<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.490> ROM<00:06:57.700> that<00:06:57.940> you're

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
directions for the ROM that you're

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.480 
directions for the ROM that you're
flashing<00:06:58.560> I've<00:06:59.560> noticed<00:06:59.890> there<00:07:00.010> are<00:07:00.040> a<00:07:00.190> couple

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
flashing I've noticed there are a couple

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.760 
flashing I've noticed there are a couple
of<00:07:00.700> roms<00:07:01.030> that<00:07:01.330> already<00:07:01.690> have<00:07:01.900> this<00:07:02.260> kernel

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
of roms that already have this kernel

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.430 
of roms that already have this kernel
module<00:07:03.160> baked<00:07:03.460> into<00:07:03.730> the<00:07:03.970> ROM<00:07:04.270> zip<00:07:04.600> so<00:07:05.290> you

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
module baked into the ROM zip so you

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.380 
module baked into the ROM zip so you
don't<00:07:05.740> have<00:07:05.860> to<00:07:05.980> flash<00:07:06.190> it<00:07:06.340> separately<00:07:06.760> once

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390 
don't have to flash it separately once

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.250 
don't have to flash it separately once
you're<00:07:07.540> ready<00:07:07.720> swipe<00:07:08.140> to<00:07:08.350> confirm<00:07:08.980> flash<00:07:09.310> and

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
you're ready swipe to confirm flash and
