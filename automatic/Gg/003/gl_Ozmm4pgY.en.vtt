we're<00:00:05.520> crocheting<00:00:05.730> wire<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:07.049> make<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
we're crocheting wire to make a

we've<00:00:09.960> gotten<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.559> far<00:00:10.700> we<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:11.880> our<00:00:12.030> bracelet

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
we've gotten so far we have our bracelet

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.959 
we've gotten so far we have our bracelet
all<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.960> way<00:00:13.049> crocheted<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.790> our

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
all the way crocheted and we have our

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.420 
all the way crocheted and we have our
two<00:00:15.179> tails<00:00:15.509> we're<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.039> really

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
two tails we're going to take the really

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.750 
two tails we're going to take the really
long<00:00:18.000> tail<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.050> made<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:20.520> going

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
long tail that we made and we're going

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
long tail that we made and we're going
to<00:00:20.910> fold<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.420> into<00:00:21.949> 32<00:00:22.949> inch<00:00:23.519> sections<00:00:24.590> we're

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to fold it into 32 inch sections we're

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.970 
to fold it into 32 inch sections we're
putting<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.250> wire<00:00:26.869> down<00:00:27.869> through<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
putting the wire down through the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
putting the wire down through the
bracelet<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.060> end<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> bracelet<00:00:32.600> leaving

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
bracelet the end of the bracelet leaving

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.549 
bracelet the end of the bracelet leaving
a<00:00:33.690> loop<00:00:34.280> we're<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> same<00:00:37.290> thing

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
a loop we're going to do the same thing

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.750 
a loop we're going to do the same thing
again<00:00:40.010> through<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.040> bracelet<00:00:43.399> leave<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> loop

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
again through the bracelet leave a loop

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.549 
again through the bracelet leave a loop
now<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:45.629> great<00:00:45.840> big<00:00:46.050> loops<00:00:48.440> do<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
now we have two great big loops do it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
now we have two great big loops do it
again<00:00:52.340> take<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> through<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.390> bracelet<00:00:54.960> we

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
again take it through the bracelet we

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.080 
again take it through the bracelet we
have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.340> loop<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:58.160> we're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.730> one

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
have a loop and we're going to do one

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
have a loop and we're going to do one
more<00:01:01.010> loop<00:01:02.600> through<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.629> bracelet<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
more loop through the bracelet with the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.480 
more loop through the bracelet with the
wire

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.830 

and<00:01:13.630> we're<00:01:14.630> folding<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.290> one<00:01:15.579> back<00:01:16.579> down<00:01:17.030> now

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
and we're folding this one back down now

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.429 
and we're folding this one back down now
we<00:01:17.899> have<00:01:18.320> four<00:01:18.829> or<00:01:18.979> five<00:01:19.220> loops<00:01:19.610> here<00:01:20.060> and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
we have four or five loops here and

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:30.290 
we have four or five loops here and
we're<00:01:21.439> just<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.009> twist<00:01:22.159> them<00:01:22.520> together

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.470 

when<00:01:31.080> we<00:01:31.230> get<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.680> twist<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.270> nice<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
when we get them all twist it nice and

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.650 
when we get them all twist it nice and
twisted<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:35.150> we're<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.390> wrap<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
twisted like that we're going to wrap it

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.500 
twisted like that we're going to wrap it
around<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.110> crochet<00:01:37.590> hook<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.300> make

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
around the crochet hook so it will make

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.590 
around the crochet hook so it will make
a<00:01:39.540> nice<00:01:39.810> curve<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.710> curve<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:42.000> down<00:01:42.330> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
a nice curve and curve it back down to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.340 
a nice curve and curve it back down to
the<00:01:42.630> bracelet<00:01:43.400> we<00:01:44.400> have<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.550> little<00:01:44.850> bit<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
the bracelet we have a little bit of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.040 
the bracelet we have a little bit of
wire<00:01:46.350> extra<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.160> here<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.910> we're<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
wire extra right here and we're going to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.750 
wire extra right here and we're going to
weave<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.830> one<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:52.530> secure<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.490> button

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
weave that one in to secure the button

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.130 
weave that one in to secure the button
loop

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.390 

then<00:02:01.140> we're<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.280> more

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
then we're going to get a little more

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:15.070 
then we're going to get a little more
wire<00:02:04.010> cut<00:02:05.010> it<00:02:05.130> off<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.640> our<00:02:07.759> wire<00:02:08.759> cutters

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.310 

more<00:02:16.080> squishing<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.340> wire<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.780> base

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
more squishing that the wire at the base

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.300 
more squishing that the wire at the base
of<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.610> loop<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.650> we're<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.830> going<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.070> wrap

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
of the loop and we're just going to wrap

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
of the loop and we're just going to wrap
this<00:02:23.610> wire<00:02:24.030> around<00:02:26.660> about<00:02:27.660> four<00:02:27.960> or<00:02:27.990> five

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
this wire around about four or five

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.920 
this wire around about four or five
times<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> give<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.790> finished<00:02:30.210> look

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.050 

and<00:02:35.079> if<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.769> still<00:02:36.010> have<00:02:36.159> wire<00:02:36.370> left<00:02:36.700> over

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
and if you still have wire left over

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.709 
and if you still have wire left over
that's<00:02:37.930> fine<00:02:38.290> we'll<00:02:38.560> use<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:39.719> attach

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
that's fine we'll use that to attach

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.379 
that's fine we'll use that to attach
some<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.200> beads
