battlefield 3 on all this grenade has
really<00:00:44.640> balanced<00:00:44.940> stats<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> radius<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
really balanced stats from the radius of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.450 
really balanced stats from the radius of
the<00:00:46.110> blast<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> distance<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> be

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the blast to the distance that can be

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
the blast to the distance that can be
thrown<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.239> grenade<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.690> no<00:00:48.899> doubt<00:00:49.140> one

thrown this grenade is no doubt one

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
thrown this grenade is no doubt one
people<00:00:49.829> tend<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> use<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> most<00:00:50.670> next<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.480> we

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
people tend to use the most next up we

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
people tend to use the most next up we
have<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> v40<00:00:52.350> mini<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.949> grenade<00:00:53.250> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
have the v40 mini this grenade is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
have the v40 mini this grenade is
slightly<00:00:53.789> smaller<00:00:53.910> compared<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> m67

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
slightly smaller compared to the m67

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
slightly smaller compared to the m67
frag<00:00:55.890> hence<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> word<00:00:56.610> mini<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> its<00:00:57.270> name

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
frag hence the word mini in its name

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.599 
frag hence the word mini in its name
it's<00:00:58.109> throwing<00:00:58.530> distance<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.039> farther<00:00:59.460> than

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it's throwing distance is farther than

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's throwing distance is farther than
the<00:00:59.730> m67<00:01:00.449> frag<00:01:00.870> grenades<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> smaller

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the m67 frag grenades but as a smaller

the m67 frag grenades but as a smaller
blast<00:01:02.399> radius<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.149> are<00:01:03.239> able<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.600> carry<00:01:03.809> three

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
blast radius you are able to carry three

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.960 
blast radius you are able to carry three
of<00:01:04.260> these<00:01:04.350> grenades<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> single<00:01:05.460> given<00:01:05.729> time

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of these grenades at a single given time

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
of these grenades at a single given time
all<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.420> playing<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.260> next<00:01:07.470> grenade<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
all you're playing the next grenade is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.890 
all you're playing the next grenade is
the<00:01:08.010> rgo<00:01:08.430> impact<00:01:08.880> grenade<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.390> based<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the rgo impact grenade now based on the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.240 
the rgo impact grenade now based on the
grenades<00:01:10.200> name<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> pretty<00:01:10.799> much<00:01:10.920> guess

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
grenades name you can pretty much guess

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.830 
grenades name you can pretty much guess
what<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> does<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.000> i'll<00:01:12.090> explain<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> anyway

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
what it does but i'll explain it anyway

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
what it does but i'll explain it anyway
it<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.320> explodes<00:01:14.010> shortly<00:01:14.400> after

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it basically explodes shortly after

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640 
it basically explodes shortly after
initial<00:01:14.970> impact<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.570> object<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
initial impact with an object like the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.320 
initial impact with an object like the
v40<00:01:17.040> mini<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.490> grenade<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:18.090> has<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
v40 mini of this grenade also has a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
v40 mini of this grenade also has a
small<00:01:18.630> blast<00:01:18.869> radius<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.860> guessing

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
small blast radius I'm guessing

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
small blast radius I'm guessing
decimated<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> balance<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.540> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
decimated this way to balance out this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
decimated this way to balance out this
grenade<00:01:21.990> considering<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.770> extremely

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
grenade considering it is extremely

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
grenade considering it is extremely
deadly<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.060> close<00:01:24.299> proximity<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
deadly if you're in close proximity to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
deadly if you're in close proximity to
it<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.770> also<00:01:25.920> carry<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.490> these<00:01:26.700> grenades

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it you can also carry to these grenades

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.429 
it you can also carry to these grenades
at<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> single<00:01:27.630> given<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:28.110> while<00:01:28.320> you're
