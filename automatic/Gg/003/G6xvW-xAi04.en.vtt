 in this video I would like to share with 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.490
 you this tutorial that allows us 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.440
 decrease the giving of our terminal or 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.540
 be that the whole system itself works 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.939
 faster as for example it will open it 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.369
 applications the transitions between 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.140
 menus and other things more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.450
 in the same way we will achieve savings 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.790
 of battery and other benefits that I will be 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.410
 commenting on the video 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 many could appreciate in the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.920
 video introduction this tutorial 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 can be carried out with any 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 device with android in any of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.630
 its versions the tutorial I took it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.940
 of the forum of htc mania and how can you see 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.780
 is one of the most commented topics with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.780
 more visits 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 the vast majority of users 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 they commented that the improvements really are 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.410
 remarkable that was just one of the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.059
 reasons that I decided to make the video 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.549
 the tutorial basically consists of 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.670
 flashing a gel recovery mod for 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.080
 this we need an advanced recovery 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.240
 here on the screen will appear several 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.320
 videos on how to install a record 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.320
 advanced in its terminals 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.630
 This mode has been developed by the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.630
 user and crisis of the forum x of a 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.480
 the user i yes galaxy of htc mania 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.920
 explain five steps how this works 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.439
 mode 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.330
 I'll leave the link here below in the 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.850
 description of the video so they can 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.409
 read the information in detail well 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 the video is not so long 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.609
 now we will see how intel opens the mountain 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.859
 in our terminal in this case I 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.009
 I'm using a samsung galaxy s2 the 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.020
 Android version that I carry is the 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.549
 4.1.2 sansÃ³ officers 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.799
 it does not matter if you have another 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.780
 Android version or if they have installed 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.780
 a custom rom a cooked rom 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.980
 The first thing we should do is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.980
 download this file 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 would link down here in the 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.640
 description of the video so they can 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.060
 download it then they should turn off their 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.060
 terminal 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.799
 and now we will enter the recovery mode 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.140
 but there we press the key 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.100
 switched on 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.140
 the key with the column up key 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.220
 simultaneously 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.220
 thus 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.080
 as you can see menu senators 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.930
 have to flash the mod the developer 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.140
 suggests that we make a backup of our 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.140
 rom 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 if you do not know how to do it from cardio a 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.440
 video here on screen so they can 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.440
 see the tutorial 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.439
 to flash the file we must continue 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.939
 the next steps 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:39.010
 we give install without borders and ricard 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.110
 we select 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.110
 then we select the penultimate option 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.340
 and we look for the file 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.390
 I have it here in downloads 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.700
 we select 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.700
 and we confirm 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.620
 now we go back 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.549
 and restart the terminal 

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:37.739
 Y 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.139
 finally 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.790
 we hope the system will update 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.290
 I took more than a month with this mod and 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.750
 I can appreciate several improvements in the 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.340
 battery could also observe that several 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.950
 applications open faster than 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.910
 before, especially those that demand more 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.800
 resources 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.660
 as I was reading in the comments 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.520
 of the forum of this improvement are still appreciated 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.490
 more in low-end terminals or 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.860
 those that are older I will 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.980
 I advise flashing the mod and thus remove 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.900
 his own conclusions remember to leave 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.970
 you like that that helps me a lot to 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.010
 continue making videos at the moment is 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.010
 we'll see each other in a next video chao 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.729
 i 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.729
 i
