three things in mind

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860 
three things in mind
it<00:00:43.860> was<00:00:44.070> function<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> push<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> wind

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it was function was to push the wind

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.790 
it was function was to push the wind
more<00:00:46.020> efficiently<00:00:47.390> style<00:00:48.390> which<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.649> our

if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.700> look<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> shape<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> fairing

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
if you look at the shape of the fairing

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.649 
if you look at the shape of the fairing
you'll<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> wind<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:35.490> quite<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> bit

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you'll see that the wind has quite a bit

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
you'll see that the wind has quite a bit
more<00:01:36.840> time<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.650> change<00:01:37.920> its<00:01:38.100> mind<00:01:38.159> where<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
more time to change its mind where it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
more time to change its mind where it
wants<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> go<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> time<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
wants to go and by the time the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
wants to go and by the time the
windshield<00:01:40.350> actually<00:01:40.650> releases<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> wind

your ipod so it charges and plays all at

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.490 
your ipod so it charges and plays all at
the<00:02:08.160> same<00:02:08.340> time<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:09.450> at<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:09.750> CD<00:02:09.959> changer

so<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> installation<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> air<00:02:15.150> master<00:02:15.569> is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so the installation of the air master is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.300 
so the installation of the air master is
identical<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.530> installation<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.250> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.320 
but take a look I like the sport tech
fairing<00:03:49.500> brackets<00:03:50.069> or<00:03:50.310> actually<00:03:50.790> weld<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.209> to

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
the bracket so it's one less thing

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440 
the bracket so it's one less thing
you've<00:03:53.370> got<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.520> hold<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.180> as<00:03:54.300> you're
