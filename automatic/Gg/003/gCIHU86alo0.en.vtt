I'm<00:00:00.870> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> briefly<00:00:01.290> show<00:00:01.890> you<00:00:01.949> how<00:00:02.220> to

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I'm going to briefly show you how to

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.379 
I'm going to briefly show you how to
attach<00:00:03.810> your<00:00:04.650> work<00:00:04.920> tail<00:00:06.379> jib<00:00:07.379> halyard<00:00:08.389> using

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
attach your work tail jib halyard using

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.570 
attach your work tail jib halyard using
a<00:00:09.450> nice<00:00:09.630> place<00:00:09.990> just<00:00:10.620> worth<00:00:10.800> noting<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.340> loop

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
a nice place just worth noting this loop

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.240 
a nice place just worth noting this loop
here<00:00:11.880> needs<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.780> big<00:00:12.960> enough<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
here needs to be big enough so that the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.490 
here needs to be big enough so that the
feral<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:15.030> still<00:00:15.330> inside<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.690> mast<00:00:16.049> when

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
feral is still inside the mast when

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.130 
feral is still inside the mast when
you've<00:00:16.650> connected<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.340> either<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.660> hook

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you've connected it either to the hook

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
you've connected it either to the hook
that<00:00:19.350> goes<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.680> your<00:00:19.770> block<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.520> muscle<00:00:20.820> block

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
that goes to your block or muscle block

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.109 
that goes to your block or muscle block
or<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:22.460> connecting<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.760> high<00:00:23.880> field

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
or is connecting on to your high field

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
or is connecting on to your high field
lever<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> first<00:00:25.140> thing<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.560> take

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
lever so the first thing to do is take

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.000 
lever so the first thing to do is take
you<00:00:26.010> three<00:00:26.189> strand<00:00:26.519> rope<00:00:26.960> unravel<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you three strand rope unravel some of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.310 
you three strand rope unravel some of
the<00:00:29.160> end<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.580> looks<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.150> place<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the end so it looks like this place it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530 
the end so it looks like this place it
through<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> loop<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.460> back<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.940> itself<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
through the loop and back on itself and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.209 
through the loop and back on itself and
you<00:00:33.809> want<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> loop<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:35.010> probably

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you want to loop that that's probably

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.100 
you want to loop that that's probably
only<00:00:35.670> needs<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.540> inch<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.930> two<00:00:37.079> inches

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
only needs to be an inch or two inches

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.979 
only needs to be an inch or two inches
in<00:00:37.739> diameter<00:00:39.620> lay<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> unlaid<00:00:41.540> rope<00:00:42.540> against

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
in diameter lay the unlaid rope against

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.650 
in diameter lay the unlaid rope against
it<00:00:43.140> pick<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> middle<00:00:44.100> strand<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> just

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it pick up the middle strand and just

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.680 
it pick up the middle strand and just
tuck<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.320> twist<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> rope<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:48.390> tuck<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
tuck it and twist the rope and tuck it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.889 
tuck it and twist the rope and tuck it
underneath<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:53.190> strands<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
underneath one of the strands and see it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.479 
underneath one of the strands and see it
will<00:00:55.110> lay<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.910> next<00:00:57.149> pull<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.020> tight

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
will lay there the next pull it tight

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.459 
will lay there the next pull it tight
the<00:00:59.489> next<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:00.629> right-handed<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the next one and I'm right-handed so it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
the next one and I'm right-handed so it
tends<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> were

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
tends to be this one here if you were

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.369 
tends to be this one here if you were
left-handed<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.809> probably<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.260> way

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
left-handed it's probably the other way

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.190 
left-handed it's probably the other way
around<00:01:04.409> goes<00:01:05.400> over<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:07.369> under<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> then

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
around goes over and under so then

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920 
around goes over and under so then
you'll<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.530> two<00:01:10.860> connected<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> can

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you'll have two connected which you can

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
you'll have two connected which you can
pull<00:01:13.170> tight<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.979> let's<00:01:16.979> sit

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
pull tight and these two let's sit

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
pull tight and these two let's sit
together<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> comes

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
together and you can see that it comes

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.310 
together and you can see that it comes
out<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> road<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.710> goes<00:01:19.950> under<00:01:21.320> over

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
out of the road when it goes under over

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.140 
out of the road when it goes under over
and<00:01:22.470> under<00:01:22.560> turn<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> over<00:01:23.580> onto<00:01:23.850> its<00:01:24.090> back

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and under turn it over onto its back

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
and under turn it over onto its back
then<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.680> generate

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
then and what you want to do is generate

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
then and what you want to do is generate
something<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:27.119> looks<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> same<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> other

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
something that looks the same the other

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230 
something that looks the same the other
side<00:01:28.320> you'll<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.520> strand<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.119> rope

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
side you'll see this strand of rope

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
side you'll see this strand of rope
coming<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.009> go

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
coming here what you need to do is go

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.749 
coming here what you need to do is go
round<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:37.579> so<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
round the back and on to that so if I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
round the back and on to that so if I
now<00:01:38.939> pull<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.780> tight<00:01:40.049> we'll<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.740> how

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
now pull it all tight we'll see how

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.360 
now pull it all tight we'll see how
started<00:01:41.280> off

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
started off

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.250 
started off
I've<00:01:44.370> got<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.730> Nicki<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.050> one

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
I've got it Nicki one is that this one

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.050 
I've got it Nicki one is that this one
goes<00:01:46.440> round<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.800> back<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.490> forward<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
goes round the back and then forward and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
goes round the back and then forward and
then<00:01:48.150> it's<00:01:48.330> just<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.540> case<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.080> going<00:01:49.680> round

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
then it's just a case of going round

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
then it's just a case of going round
going<00:01:50.910> back<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> middle<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.080> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
going back to the middle when you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.450 
going back to the middle when you
started<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:54.620> going<00:01:55.620> it<00:01:55.740> comes<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.340> goes

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
started with going it comes out it goes

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.350 
started with going it comes out it goes
over<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> under<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.160> over<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.670> under<00:01:59.970> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.510 

then<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.720> next<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> goes<00:02:04.470> over<00:02:04.740> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
then to the next one it goes over so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.540 
then to the next one it goes over so
it's<00:02:05.640> under<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:11.630> then<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.750> next<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
it's under that one then the next one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.970 
it's under that one then the next one

played into it again twist it up put it
tight<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:27.239> start<00:02:27.600> again<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.380> over<00:02:28.739> and

under twist the wrist back up the next
one<00:02:35.989> everyone<00:02:36.989> under<00:02:37.320> now<00:02:38.600> conventionally

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
one everyone under now conventionally

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.670 
one everyone under now conventionally
for<00:02:40.980> man-made<00:02:41.820> ropes<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.870> hemp<00:02:43.230> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
for man-made ropes so like hemp you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.000 
for man-made ropes so like hemp you
would<00:02:43.920> do<00:02:44.100> three<00:02:44.840> tux<00:02:45.840> or<00:02:46.260> three<00:02:46.530> rounds<00:02:46.920> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
would do three tux or three rounds of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.979 
would do three tux or three rounds of
under<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.370> over<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.090> synthetic<00:02:48.390> rope<00:02:48.690> so

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
under and over and for synthetic rope so

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.190 
under and over and for synthetic rope so
nylon<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.660> polyester<00:02:51.660> whatever

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
nylon like this is polyester whatever

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.240 
nylon like this is polyester whatever
it's<00:02:52.350> made<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:55.410> would<00:02:55.560> traditionally<00:02:55.739> do

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it's made of you would traditionally do

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.370 
it's made of you would traditionally do
five<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:56.940> three<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:59.220> keep<00:02:59.370> going

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
five so that's three so just keep going

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:10.460 
five so that's three so just keep going
over<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.590> under<00:03:07.100> now<00:03:08.100> once<00:03:08.310> I've<00:03:08.549> done<00:03:09.470> five

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
over and under now once I've done five

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.090 
over and under now once I've done five
of<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:13.549> all<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.730> way<00:03:14.850> round<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
of these all the way round this is the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.640 
of these all the way round this is the
fourth<00:03:17.340> one

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.320 

so<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> did<00:03:24.980> get<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.400> fourth<00:03:25.610> one<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.120> only

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
so I did get to the fourth one so I only

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.110 
so I did get to the fourth one so I only
want<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.660> do<00:03:26.780> 25<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.220> what<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.400> would<00:03:28.490> do<00:03:28.730> now<00:03:28.940> is

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
want to do 25 so what I would do now is

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.240 
want to do 25 so what I would do now is
look<00:03:29.330> at<00:03:29.480> how<00:03:29.540> long<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.140> needs<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.740> be<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.100> just

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
look at how long it needs to be to just

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.300 
look at how long it needs to be to just
get<00:03:31.460> under<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.820> next<00:03:32.060> one<00:03:32.240> and<00:03:32.780> then<00:03:33.310> i'd

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
get under the next one and then i'd

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.860 
get under the next one and then i'd
probably<00:03:34.580> take<00:03:34.850> one<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.180> these<00:03:35.270> store<00:03:35.570> two<00:03:35.780> of

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
probably take one of these store two of

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.080 
probably take one of these store two of
these<00:03:35.960> two<00:03:36.200> strands<00:03:36.500> off<00:03:36.740> go<00:03:37.430> over<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.850> under

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
these two strands off go over and under

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.060 
these two strands off go over and under
round<00:03:38.330> take<00:03:38.750> another<00:03:38.990> strand<00:03:39.380> off<00:03:39.560> over<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
round take another strand off over and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.710 
round take another strand off over and
under<00:03:40.280> round<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.820> then<00:03:40.910> take<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.210> last<00:03:41.420> round

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
under round and then take the last round

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.210 
under round and then take the last round
off<00:03:41.870> over<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.380> under<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:42.710> i'd<00:03:42.830> end<00:03:42.980> up<00:03:43.070> with

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
off over and under so i'd end up with

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.370 
off over and under so i'd end up with
about<00:03:43.250> seven<00:03:43.760> or<00:03:43.820> eight<00:03:44.000> types<00:03:44.780> all<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.110> go<00:03:45.230> i'm

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
about seven or eight types all to go i'm

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.840 
about seven or eight types all to go i'm
going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.590> stop<00:03:45.740> at<00:03:45.770> 4-4<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.730> other

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
going to stop at 4-4 here the other

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.090 
going to stop at 4-4 here the other
option<00:03:47.210> is<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.450> do<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.870> next<00:03:48.020> tongue<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.710> then

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
option is to do the next tongue and then

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.730 
option is to do the next tongue and then
go<00:03:49.250> round<00:03:49.520> with<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.700> knife<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.210> just<00:03:50.740> neatly

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
go round with a knife and just neatly

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.570 
go round with a knife and just neatly
cut<00:03:52.460> them<00:03:52.640> off<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.030> then<00:03:53.180> seal<00:03:53.420> them<00:03:53.660> with<00:03:54.580> a

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
cut them off and then seal them with a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.060 
cut them off and then seal them with a
lighter<00:03:56.120> or<00:03:56.510> something<00:03:57.500> similar<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:57.890> that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
lighter or something similar so that

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.160 
lighter or something similar so that
you've<00:03:58.160> got<00:03:58.190> nice<00:03:58.520> again<00:03:59.300> you<00:03:59.720> always<00:03:59.930> take

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
you've got nice again you always take

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.470 
you've got nice again you always take
this<00:04:00.350> end<00:04:00.590> if<00:04:00.830> your<00:04:01.670> left<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.180> little<00:04:02.210> bit

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
this end if your left a little bit

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.150 
this end if your left a little bit
untidy<00:04:02.810> or<00:04:03.080> bitless<00:04:03.320> so<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.800> should<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:03.950> nice

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
untidy or bitless so it should be nice

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.070 
untidy or bitless so it should be nice
and<00:04:04.220> tight<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:04.850> should<00:04:05.570> look<00:04:05.720> something<00:04:05.960> like

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
and tight and should look something like

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.160 
and tight and should look something like
that<00:04:06.440> with<00:04:07.340> your<00:04:07.490> loop<00:04:07.700> other<00:04:08.240> thing<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.960> stop

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
that with your loop other thing to stop

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.930 
that with your loop other thing to stop
this<00:04:09.290> wearing<00:04:09.680> through<00:04:09.920> too<00:04:10.220> quickly<00:04:10.250> if<00:04:10.790> you

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
this wearing through too quickly if you

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.190 
this wearing through too quickly if you
remember<00:04:11.300> when<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.510> put<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.780> down<00:04:11.810> onto<00:04:12.110> the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
remember when you put it down onto the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.500 
remember when you put it down onto the
Highfield<00:04:12.680> lever<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.520> it's<00:04:13.700> hooked<00:04:14.030> on<00:04:14.270> in

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
Highfield lever and it's hooked on in

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.360 
Highfield lever and it's hooked on in
the<00:04:14.690> hook<00:04:14.840> like<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.110> just<00:04:15.770> make<00:04:15.950> sure<00:04:15.980> that

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
the hook like this just make sure that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.340 
the hook like this just make sure that
you<00:04:16.460> pull<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.910> rope<00:04:17.210> off<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.690> one<00:04:17.840> side<00:04:17.870> so

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
you pull the rope off to one side so

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.479 
you pull the rope off to one side so
that<00:04:18.470> when<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.650> put<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.860> pressure<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.280> it

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
that when you put the pressure on it

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.640 
that when you put the pressure on it
doesn't<00:04:20.150> trap<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.480> hook<00:04:20.690> on<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.320> roping

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
doesn't trap the hook on the roping

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.570 
doesn't trap the hook on the roping
there<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:22.010> will<00:04:22.100> wear<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.310> through

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
there because that will wear it through
