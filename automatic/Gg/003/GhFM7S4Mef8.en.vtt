pretty cool I dig it there's the back of
the<00:03:31.970> Hulk<00:03:32.209> got<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.989> really<00:03:33.230> dark<00:03:33.470> green

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
the Hulk got this really dark green

the Hulk got this really dark green
going<00:03:34.130> in<00:03:34.250> here<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.120> think<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.570> shading<00:03:35.959> was

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079

going in here so I think the shading was
really<00:03:36.380> well<00:03:36.530> done<00:03:36.560> on<00:03:36.799> this<00:03:37.100> guy<00:03:37.310> thing's

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.039 
pretty dope now as articulation like I
said<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.579> bit<00:03:41.000> on<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.390> lacking<00:03:41.840> side

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
said is a bit on the lacking side

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.720 
said is a bit on the lacking side
compared<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.590> some<00:03:42.920> of<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.040> newer<00:03:43.250> selects

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730

his<00:03:44.269> head<00:03:44.600> moves<00:03:44.870> up<00:03:45.230> only<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.760> far<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.750> you

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
his head moves up only this far so you

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.449 
his head moves up only this far so you
can't<00:03:48.110> get<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.440> looking<00:03:48.620> up<00:03:48.799> any<00:03:49.040> farther<00:03:49.280> than

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
can't get it looking up any farther than

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.800 
can't get it looking up any farther than
that<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.790> can<00:03:49.940> have<00:03:50.090> him<00:03:50.209> look<00:03:50.360> down<00:03:50.600> though

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
that you can have him look down though

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.240 
that you can have him look down though
that's<00:03:50.989> pretty<00:03:51.260> cool<00:03:51.410> moves<00:03:51.709> side<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:51.950> side

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
that's pretty cool moves side to side

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.250 
that's pretty cool moves side to side
just<00:03:52.280> fine<00:03:52.820> but<00:03:53.060> it's<00:03:53.209> got<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.570> angle<00:03:54.019> going

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
just fine but it's got the angle going

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.640 
just fine but it's got the angle going
on<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:55.400> yes<00:03:56.390> he's<00:03:56.780> always<00:03:57.049> kind<00:03:57.560> of

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
on to it so yes he's always kind of

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.100 
on to it so yes he's always kind of
looking<00:03:57.920> down<00:03:57.950> that's<00:03:58.790> one<00:03:59.420> bummer

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
looking down that's one bummer

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.810 
looking down that's one bummer
he<00:04:00.440> has<00:04:00.560> shoulder<00:04:00.890> articulation<00:04:01.519> that<00:04:01.610> moves

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
he has shoulder articulation that moves

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.229 
he has shoulder articulation that moves
outward<00:04:02.299> like<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.019> moves<00:04:03.500> forward<00:04:04.070> like<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.640> he

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
outward like so moves forward like so he

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.420 
outward like so moves forward like so he
has<00:04:05.329> single<00:04:05.720> jointed<00:04:06.019> elbows<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.709> rotate

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
has single jointed elbows that rotate

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.229 
has single jointed elbows that rotate
and<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:08.150> bends<00:04:08.510> up<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.709> down<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.190> much<00:04:10.610> he

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
and it bends up and down that much he

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.240 
and it bends up and down that much he
has<00:04:11.269> wrist<00:04:11.690> articulation<00:04:11.870> right<00:04:12.620> here<00:04:13.070> his

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
has wrist articulation right here his

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.580 
has wrist articulation right here his
waist<00:04:13.579> moves<00:04:13.850> side<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.150> side<00:04:14.600> he<00:04:15.260> has<00:04:15.380> nice

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
waist moves side to side he has nice

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.620 
waist moves side to side he has nice
ball<00:04:15.920> jointed<00:04:16.280> legs<00:04:16.549> right<00:04:16.940> here<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.419> move

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
ball jointed legs right here that move

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.370 
ball jointed legs right here that move
forward<00:04:18.530> but<00:04:18.950> kind<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.519> not<00:04:20.120> too<00:04:20.359> much<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:21.079> guess

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
forward but kind of not too much I guess

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.610 
forward but kind of not too much I guess
so<00:04:21.859> it's<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.370> little<00:04:23.060> weird<00:04:23.240> but<00:04:23.960> they<00:04:24.110> sculpted

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
so it's a little weird but they sculpted

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.080 
so it's a little weird but they sculpted
the<00:04:24.740> ball<00:04:24.950> joint<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.340> there<00:04:25.490> which<00:04:25.700> looks

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
you could straighten his knees out he

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.490 
you could straighten his knees out he
would<00:05:18.150> probably<00:05:18.450> be<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.840> same<00:05:19.050> height<00:05:19.260> here

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
would probably be the same height here

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.230 
would probably be the same height here
he<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.680> compared<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.460> Marvel<00:05:20.910> Legends

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
he is compared to the Marvel Legends

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.990 
he is compared to the Marvel Legends
wave3<00:05:21.510> Punisher<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:23.010> McFarlane<00:05:23.610> Spidey

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
wave3 Punisher and the McFarlane Spidey

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.480 
wave3 Punisher and the McFarlane Spidey
from<00:05:24.300> Hasbro<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.170> think<00:05:25.620> he<00:05:25.740> does<00:05:25.950> work<00:05:26.220> well

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
from Hasbro so I think he does work well

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.340 
from Hasbro so I think he does work well
with<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.910> Marvel<00:05:27.240> Legends<00:05:27.510> scale<00:05:27.780> setup<00:05:28.230> if

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
with the Marvel Legends scale setup if

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.660 
with the Marvel Legends scale setup if
you<00:05:28.440> wanted<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.800> do<00:05:28.980> that<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.190> think<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.580> would

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
you wanted to do that I think it would

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.280 
you wanted to do that I think it would
work<00:05:29.700> out<00:05:30.000> pretty<00:05:30.210> well<00:05:30.330> as<00:05:30.660> I<00:05:30.870> have<00:05:31.020> felt

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
work out pretty well as I have felt

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.830 
work out pretty well as I have felt
about<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:32.160> original<00:05:32.640> Marvel<00:05:32.850> Select<00:05:33.120> Hulk<00:05:33.540> so

about the original Marvel Select Hulk so

off the base that's another thing I

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.660 
off the base that's another thing I
wanted<00:05:37.500> to<00:05:37.590> mention<00:05:37.800> is<00:05:38.130> that<00:05:38.250> this<00:05:38.400> first

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410
