demonstrate that in a minute - of course

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.859 
demonstrate that in a minute - of course
bass<00:01:35.950> treble<00:01:36.280> volume<00:01:36.909> so<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.450> really<00:01:37.780> a

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
bass treble volume so it's really a

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.630 
bass treble volume so it's really a
no-nonsense<00:01:38.260> amp<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.830> course<00:01:39.070> here<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.490> is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
no-nonsense amp of course here this is

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.310 
no-nonsense amp of course here this is
the<00:01:39.729> second<00:01:40.090> channel<00:01:40.240> or<00:01:40.810> actually<00:01:41.080> this<00:01:41.200> is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
the second channel or actually this is

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.499 
the second channel or actually this is
channel<00:01:41.619> 1<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:41.950> channel<00:01:42.280> 2<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:43.330> is

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
channel 1 this channel 2 and this is

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.350 
channel 1 this channel 2 and this is
even<00:01:44.020> more<00:01:44.170> basic<00:01:44.439> volume<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.340> brilliance<00:01:45.909> so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
even more basic volume and brilliance so

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.359 
even more basic volume and brilliance so
there's<00:01:47.110> no<00:01:47.229> surprises<00:01:47.619> here<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.189> only

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369

it's a very best sounding m4a1 by 12:3
one<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.080> most<00:03:29.260> specs<00:03:29.620> on<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:30.070> around<00:03:30.790> for

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
one of the most specs on is around for

one of the most specs on is around for
that<00:03:31.180> amount<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.490> go<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.940> pentose<00:03:37.050> you

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
that amount if you go to the pentose you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
will see that everything i just

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.220 
will see that everything i just
demonstrated<00:03:39.490> is<00:03:40.060> even<00:03:40.300> more<00:03:40.510> intense<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.140> if

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
demonstrated is even more intense so if

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.650 
demonstrated is even more intense so if
you<00:03:41.380> start<00:03:41.740> with<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.100> low<00:03:42.760> volume<00:03:43.210> less<00:03:43.390> or<00:03:43.540> in

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
you start with the low volume less or in

00:03:43.660 --> 00:04:18.920 
you start with the low volume less or in
let's<00:03:43.990> say<00:03:44.110> around<00:03:44.230> two

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.990 

so<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.020> notice<00:04:20.320> when<00:04:20.740> you<00:04:20.830> turn<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.190> m26<00:04:21.640> on

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
so you notice when you turn the m26 on

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.170 
so you notice when you turn the m26 on
the<00:04:22.180> fence<00:04:22.420> of<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.630> moment<00:04:23.670> it's<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:25.060> know

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
the fence of the moment it's you know

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.690 
the fence of the moment it's you know
pulled<00:04:26.050> out<00:04:26.200> flat<00:04:26.590> out<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:26.980> really<00:04:27.310> reading

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
pulled out flat out it's really reading

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.990 
pulled out flat out it's really reading
aggressive<00:04:28.570> well<00:04:28.750> let's<00:04:29.290> say<00:04:29.440> intensive<00:04:30.280> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
aggressive well let's say intensive the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.610 
aggressive well let's say intensive the
only<00:04:31.210> thing<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.810> easier<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.350> control

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
only thing is it's easier to control

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.040 
only thing is it's easier to control
only<00:04:33.070> try<00:04:33.370> autonomic<00:04:33.910> which<00:04:34.030> will<00:04:34.210> be<00:04:34.780> more

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
only try autonomic which will be more

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.980 
only try autonomic which will be more
expressive<00:04:35.500> when<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.890> turn<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.310> me

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
expressive when you turn to me

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.650 
expressive when you turn to me
of<00:04:38.260> course<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.680> when<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:39.280> learn<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.730> work

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
of course you when you learn to work

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.870 
of course you when you learn to work
with<00:04:40.870> your<00:04:40.990> volume<00:04:41.470> on<00:04:41.620> your<00:04:41.770> guitar<00:04:41.890> you'll

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
with your volume on your guitar you'll

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.480 
with your volume on your guitar you'll
see<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.420> whole<00:04:43.450> bed<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.170> whole<00:04:45.100> array<00:04:45.460> of

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
see that the whole bed of whole array of

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.580 
see that the whole bed of whole array of
signs<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.180> man<00:04:46.480> who<00:04:46.690> make<00:04:46.900> more<00:04:47.140> sorts<00:04:47.500> of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
signs you can man who make more sorts of

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.980 
signs you can man who make more sorts of
sounds<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.940> know<00:04:49.030> with<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.300> same<00:04:49.540> at<00:04:49.750> the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
sounds you know with the same at the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.390 
sounds you know with the same at the
same<00:04:50.020> setting<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.650> don't<00:04:50.860> have<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.070> turn<00:04:51.250> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
same setting you don't have to turn the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.180 
same setting you don't have to turn the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:23.180 

Oh

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:07:04.250 

and
