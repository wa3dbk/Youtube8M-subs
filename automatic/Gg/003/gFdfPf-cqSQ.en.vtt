inside the nutribullet

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.419 
inside the nutribullet
it<00:00:25.880> stains<00:00:26.449> it's<00:00:26.929> like<00:00:27.169> the<00:00:27.650> stuff<00:00:27.890> drips<00:00:28.250> out

you haven't seen the other video that
I've<00:00:48.829> done<00:00:49.039> what<00:00:49.640> happens<00:00:49.969> is<00:00:50.620> these<00:00:51.620> cups

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
I've done what happens is these cups

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.150 
I've done what happens is these cups
have<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.160> max<00:00:52.489> line<00:00:52.760> capacity<00:00:54.129> city<00:00:55.570> what<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:57.160> and

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
have a max line capacity city what I and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.009 
have a max line capacity city what I and
a<00:00:58.219> lot<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.519> other<00:00:58.670> people<00:00:59.030> tend<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.359> do<00:00:59.539> is<00:00:59.750> fill

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
a lot of other people tend to do is fill

a lot of other people tend to do is fill
it<00:01:00.140> past<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:00.769> max<00:01:01.070> line<00:01:01.340> now<00:01:02.239> what<00:01:02.629> happens

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
it past this max line now what happens

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.380 
it past this max line now what happens
when<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:03.379> do<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.890> all<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.850> liquid<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.300> going

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
when you do that all the liquid is going

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.710 
when you do that all the liquid is going
to<00:01:05.510> push<00:01:05.720> out<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:07.040> starts<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.430> push

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
to push out and it starts to push

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.960 
to push out and it starts to push
through<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:09.020> little<00:01:09.380> thing<00:01:09.740> now<00:01:10.280> as<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.760> gets

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
through this little thing now as it gets

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.360 
through this little thing now as it gets
old<00:01:11.210> as<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.020> blade<00:01:12.260> gets<00:01:12.500> old<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:13.070> don't

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
old as the the blade gets old I don't

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.730 
old as the the blade gets old I don't
know<00:01:13.460> if<00:01:13.550> you<00:01:13.640> can<00:01:13.790> see<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.150> or<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:15.350> don't<00:01:15.650> know

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
know if you can see it or I don't know

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.560 
know if you can see it or I don't know
if<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:15.920> can<00:01:16.040> see<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.090> start<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.450> get

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
if you can see it but you start to get

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.970 
if you can see it but you start to get
the<00:01:17.720> separation<00:01:18.400> between<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.790> blade<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
the separation between the blade and the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.430 
the separation between the blade and the
middle<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:23.030> causes<00:01:23.510> in<00:01:23.720> when<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.200> put

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
middle of it that causes in when you put

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.500 
middle of it that causes in when you put
too<00:01:24.620> much<00:01:24.650> liquid<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:25.700> pressure<00:01:26.000> makes<00:01:26.360> it

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
too much liquid that pressure makes it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.330 
too much liquid that pressure makes it
push<00:01:26.750> through<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.260> leaks<00:01:27.470> through<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.980> bottom

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
push through it leaks through the bottom

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.210 
push through it leaks through the bottom
if<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:28.910> can<00:01:29.150> see<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.420> rust<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.810> my<00:01:29.960> finger<00:01:30.380> it

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
if you can see the rust on my finger it

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.940 
if you can see the rust on my finger it
starts<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.760> rust<00:01:32.230> some<00:01:33.230> people<00:01:33.530> complain<00:01:33.920> that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
starts to rust some people complain that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.120 
starts to rust some people complain that
it<00:01:34.250> leaks<00:01:34.490> around<00:01:34.730> the<00:01:35.060> ceiling<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:35.690> here

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
it leaks around the ceiling right here

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.610 
it leaks around the ceiling right here
but<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:37.880> actually<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:38.810> coming<00:01:39.230> from<00:01:39.410> this

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
but it's actually it's coming from this

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620 
but it's actually it's coming from this
way<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.280> if<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.670> see<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.970> blades<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.450> some

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
way and if you see the blades of some

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.930 
way and if you see the blades of some
discoloration<00:01:42.530> on<00:01:42.620> it's<00:01:42.890> not<00:01:43.010> rust<00:01:43.400> actually

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
discoloration on it's not rust actually

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.440 
discoloration on it's not rust actually
it's<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:44.300> like<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:45.860> think<00:01:46.610> if<00:01:46.820> I<00:01:46.940> scrubbed<00:01:47.300> it

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
it's just like I think if I scrubbed it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870 
it's just like I think if I scrubbed it
it<00:01:47.570> will<00:01:47.690> come<00:01:47.810> off<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.260> lot<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.220> times<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.700> will

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
it will come off a lot of times I will

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.090 
it will come off a lot of times I will
also<00:01:50.300> have<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.510> habit<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.930> just<00:01:51.350> rinsing<00:01:51.800> it<00:01:51.950> off

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
also have a habit of just rinsing it off

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.600 
also have a habit of just rinsing it off
and<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:53.690> guess<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.080> little<00:01:54.350> stuff<00:01:55.100> just<00:01:55.370> gets

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
and I guess the little stuff just gets

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.080 
and I guess the little stuff just gets
stuck<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.360> call<00:01:57.520> like<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.640> said<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:58.940> does

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
stuck on it call like I said it does

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.820 
stuck on it call like I said it does
rust<00:01:59.750> under<00:02:00.200> here<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:03.320> little<00:02:03.590> things

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
rust under here and the little things

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.620 
rust under here and the little things
start<00:02:03.980> to<00:02:04.190> come<00:02:04.400> out<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.300> push<00:02:05.510> them

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
start to come out you have to push them

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.190 
start to come out you have to push them
