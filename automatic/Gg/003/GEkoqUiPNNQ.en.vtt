weirder<00:01:59.790> has<00:01:59.939> happened<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:00.869> life<00:02:00.899> and

maybe with this generation of consoles

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
maybe with this generation of consoles
maybe<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.610> hardware<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.180> very

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
maybe because it the hardware is very

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.700

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.010 
well understood it's basically just
computer<00:02:08.610> hardware<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> PlayStation<00:02:09.810> 4

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
computer hardware in the PlayStation 4

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.190 
computer hardware in the PlayStation 4
and<00:02:10.110> Xbox<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.619> maybe<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.700> easier<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and Xbox one maybe it's easier to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.250 
and Xbox one maybe it's easier to
eat<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> manufacturing<00:02:14.280> process<00:02:14.849> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
eat up the manufacturing process and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.900 
eat up the manufacturing process and
consolidate<00:02:16.260> ships<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:16.950> streamline

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
consolidate ships and and streamline

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.180 
consolidate ships and and streamline
everything<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.540> maybe<00:02:18.629> we<00:02:18.870> will<00:02:19.050> see<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.379> slim

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
everything and maybe we will see a slim

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
everything and maybe we will see a slim
version<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> PlayStation<00:02:21.330> 4<00:02:21.440> sooner<00:02:22.440> than

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
version of the PlayStation 4 sooner than

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.680 
version of the PlayStation 4 sooner than
we<00:02:22.709> did<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:22.950> other<00:02:23.190> generations<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.450> i

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
we did in other generations but I just i

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.009 
we did in other generations but I just i
highly<00:02:25.650> doubt<00:02:25.680> we're<00:02:26.160> gonna<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.760> not<00:02:27.599> even

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
highly doubt we're gonna see it not even

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.320 
highly doubt we're gonna see it not even
not<00:02:28.769> even<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.190> quarter<00:02:29.489> way<00:02:29.819> through<00:02:30.150> the

not even a quarter way through the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
doesn't make any sense for them to come

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.530 
doesn't make any sense for them to come
out<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.500> right<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.819> hey<00:02:35.970> who<00:02:36.330> knows

out with it right now but hey who knows
maybe<00:02:37.019> I'm<00:02:37.290> totally<00:02:37.590> wrong<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.340> I'll<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.790> to

maybe I'm totally wrong and I'll have to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
maybe I'm totally wrong and I'll have to
eat<00:02:39.030> my<00:02:39.239> words<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.720> few<00:02:39.900> months<00:02:40.049> we'll<00:02:40.470> have

the design of the PlayStation 4 it's

the design of the PlayStation 4 it's
relatively<00:02:46.290> small<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:47.220> not<00:02:47.489> Alienware

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
in this video for or two you'll see how

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.130 
in this video for or two you'll see how
much<00:02:53.640> smaller<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.239> Alienware<00:02:54.569> alpha<00:02:54.690> is

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
much smaller the Alienware alpha is

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.500 
much smaller the Alienware alpha is
compared<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.160> PlayStation<00:02:56.700> 4<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.209> that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
compared to the PlayStation 4 but that

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
compared to the PlayStation 4 but that
thing<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.750> tiny<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.650> that's<00:02:59.370> kind<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.640> an

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
thing is tiny so that's kind of an

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.460 
thing is tiny so that's kind of an
unfair<00:03:00.060> comparison<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> PlayStation<00:03:01.440> 4

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
unfair comparison but the PlayStation 4

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.190 
unfair comparison but the PlayStation 4
is<00:03:01.739> small<00:03:02.040> enough<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.700> sleek<00:03:03.090> looking<00:03:03.480> no

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
is small enough it's sleek looking no

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.479 
is small enough it's sleek looking no
one's<00:03:04.470> asking<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.579> ps4<00:03:06.000> slim<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.489> see

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
one's asking for a ps4 slim and I see

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.759 
one's asking for a ps4 slim and I see
people<00:03:08.849> saying<00:03:09.120> oh<00:03:09.239> because<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.810> Xbox<00:03:10.500> one

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
people saying oh because the Xbox one

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.680 
people saying oh because the Xbox one
outsold<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> PlayStation<00:03:11.970> 4<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.420> States

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
outsold the PlayStation 4 in the States

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.620 
outsold the PlayStation 4 in the States
for<00:03:12.989> two<00:03:13.920> months<00:03:14.370> maybe<00:03:14.670> that's<00:03:14.940> why<00:03:15.090> Sony's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
for two months maybe that's why Sony's

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.599 
for two months maybe that's why Sony's
trying<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.019> speed<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.500> process<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.099> ps4

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
trying to speed up the process of a ps4

trying to speed up the process of a ps4
slim<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.389> don't<00:03:19.319> really<00:03:19.440> see<00:03:19.709> how<00:03:19.829> that

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
slim but I don't really see how that

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.289 
slim but I don't really see how that
would<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.190> anything<00:03:20.400> since<00:03:20.730> people<00:03:20.940> really

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
would do anything since people really

would do anything since people really
like<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.660> way<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> PlayStation<00:03:22.440> 4<00:03:22.470> looks<00:03:22.920> to

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
like the way the PlayStation 4 looks to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.410 
like the way the PlayStation 4 looks to
begin<00:03:23.310> with<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.639> thought<00:03:23.910> doesn't<00:03:24.060> make<00:03:24.299> any

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
begin with I thought doesn't make any

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.180 
begin with I thought doesn't make any
sense<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.870> me<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.170> anything<00:03:25.769> if<00:03:25.920> there's<00:03:26.100> any

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
sense to me if anything if there's any

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.970 
sense to me if anything if there's any
console<00:03:27.030> out<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> market<00:03:28.380> right<00:03:28.410> now<00:03:28.590> that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
console out in the market right now that

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.610 
console out in the market right now that
could<00:03:29.190> use<00:03:29.430> an<00:03:29.579> overhaul<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.660> Xbox<00:03:31.260> one

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
could use an overhaul it's the Xbox one

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.729 
could use an overhaul it's the Xbox one
I<00:03:31.889> don't<00:03:32.730> think<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.239> god-awful<00:03:33.840> ugly<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.709> a

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
I don't think it's god-awful ugly like a

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.620 
I don't think it's god-awful ugly like a
lot<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.040> people<00:03:35.280> do<00:03:35.609> but<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.239> thing<00:03:36.480> is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
lot of people do but the thing is

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.099 
lot of people do but the thing is
ginormous<00:03:37.109> man<00:03:37.829> III<00:03:38.700> think<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.450> reason<00:03:39.840> why

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
ginormous man III think the reason why

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.340 
ginormous man III think the reason why
actually<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.620> know<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.980> reason<00:03:41.340> why<00:03:42.350> that

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
actually I know the reason why that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.920 
actually I know the reason why that
Microsoft<00:03:44.250> went<00:03:44.459> with<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.609> gigantic<00:03:45.269> design<00:03:45.750> is

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
Microsoft went with a gigantic design is

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.629 
Microsoft went with a gigantic design is
they<00:03:46.049> didn't<00:03:46.350> want<00:03:46.410> any<00:03:46.620> overheating<00:03:47.310> issues

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
they didn't want any overheating issues

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.090 
they didn't want any overheating issues
like<00:03:48.299> what<00:03:48.450> happened<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.989> original<00:03:49.470> 360

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
like what happened with the original 360

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.830 
like what happened with the original 360
so<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> think<00:03:50.519> they<00:03:50.609> became<00:03:50.880> very<00:03:51.060> paranoid<00:03:51.540> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
so I think they became very paranoid of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.559 
so I think they became very paranoid of
that<00:03:52.049> which<00:03:52.739> hey<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.190> rather<00:03:53.609> than<00:03:53.880> make<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> big

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
that which hey I rather than make a big

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.170 
that which hey I rather than make a big
ginormous<00:03:54.930> console<00:03:55.829> like<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:56.910> try<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
ginormous console like that then try to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.759 
ginormous console like that then try to
make<00:03:57.389> something<00:03:57.630> super<00:03:58.109> streamlined<00:03:58.440> and

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
make something super streamlined and

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.449 
make something super streamlined and
have<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.069> overheat<00:03:59.459> again<00:03:59.760> but<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:01.220> don't<00:04:02.220> that

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
have it overheat again but I don't that

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.949 
have it overheat again but I don't that
I<00:04:02.519> think<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.910> lot<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.180> people<00:04:03.660> would<00:04:03.810> be<00:04:03.930> very

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
I think a lot of people would be very

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.839 
I think a lot of people would be very
happy<00:04:04.500> if<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:04.950> came<00:04:05.160> out<00:04:05.310> with<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> much

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
happy if they came out with a much

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.420 
happy if they came out with a much
sleeker<00:04:06.750> looking<00:04:07.230> Xbox<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:08.010> because<00:04:08.190> many

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
sleeker looking Xbox one because many

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.360 
sleeker looking Xbox one because many
people<00:04:08.810> compare<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.109> a<00:04:10.139> VCR<00:04:10.769> from<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.190> late

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
people compare it to a VCR from the late

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.089 
people compare it to a VCR from the late
80s<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.910> early<00:04:12.030> 90s<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:13.019> could<00:04:13.650> kind<00:04:14.010> of

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
80s and early 90s and I could kind of

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.879 
80s and early 90s and I could kind of
see<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> pretty<00:04:15.569> accurate<00:04:15.889> comparison

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
see that is a pretty accurate comparison

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.650 
see that is a pretty accurate comparison
I<00:04:16.979> don't<00:04:17.160> think<00:04:17.340> it's<00:04:17.519> as<00:04:17.700> ugly<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.239> those<00:04:18.450> old

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
I don't think it's as ugly as those old

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.349 
I don't think it's as ugly as those old
school<00:04:18.810> VCRs<00:04:19.470> are<00:04:19.709> but<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.489> does<00:04:20.729> kind<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.180> look

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
school VCRs are but it does kind of look

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.480 
school VCRs are but it does kind of look
like<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:21.870> I'm<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.349> saying<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.159> bottom

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
like one I'm just saying so the bottom

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.980 
like one I'm just saying so the bottom
line<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.669> we'll<00:04:24.030> have<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.240> wait<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.750> see<00:04:24.960> I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
line is we'll have to wait and see I

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.629
