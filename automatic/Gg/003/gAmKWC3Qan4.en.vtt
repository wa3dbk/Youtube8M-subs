kind of rarity symbol I'm guessing the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.159 
kind of rarity symbol I'm guessing the
foils<00:04:49.830> are<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.220> different<00:04:51.210> thing<00:04:51.479> like<00:04:52.020> I

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
foils are a different thing like I

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.860

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.999 
foil and I haven't seen any of the non
the<00:04:57.120> foil<00:04:57.389> cards<00:04:57.690> as<00:04:57.810> regular<00:04:58.139> cards<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.949> I'm

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
the foil cards as regular cards so I'm

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.409 
the foil cards as regular cards so I'm
guessing<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.490> foils<00:04:59.850> are<00:04:59.970> something<00:05:00.270> else

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
guessing the foils are something else

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.820 
guessing the foils are something else
but<00:05:00.539> I<00:05:00.600> could<00:05:00.780> be<00:05:00.900> wrong<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.289> haven't<00:05:01.560> seen<00:05:01.680> that
