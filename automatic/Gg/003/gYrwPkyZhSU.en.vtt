00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 new two guys who are welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 one more day to the channel and well this time 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 I bring a hybrid of four leagues to 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.900
 make skills an incredible team that 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.639
 it works quite well in a few matches 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.710
 I tried that but I think it's 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.960
 sorry so good without further delay 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.699
 let's go with the defensive line good 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 how is this is the defensive line I 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 I think this line is and it's amazing 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 simply because the defenses is not 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 that are excessively high but has 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.670
 a good rhythm that to cut balls goes 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.859
 great and excessively also manga 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.380
 he has a lot of physics 85 as he says 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 incredible from the right side is with 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 a very fast side that for its price 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 it's worth one hundred percent the truth 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 I recommend them and the lateral sections 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190
 left to the castle a side 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.320
 left that I had never tried the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 true this year if he is the first to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 it proves it and how is it 87 rhythm and truth 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 is that he also has 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 enough defense to make a silver 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.219
 a-66 and I think it's perfect too 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 I can point out that I've tried it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.430
 the clearance and has very good dribbling for 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.090
 redo the defenses 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.310
 we go with the center of the field 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.869
 I started in the middle of the field this 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.359
 line is also amazing how the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.310
 defense but simply with ramirez and 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.439
 with guarín I think they make it perfect 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.179
 more than anything because they give that touch of 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.640
 help the defense and also for example 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.319
 by throwing incredible guardians and they are not 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.600
 nothing slow to make defenses and then 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.549
 we have a midfielder offensive to javier 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.170
 rodríguez I'm going to love this year the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.729
 truth is certainly the cheap option of 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.459
 di Maria yes it is true that di Maria 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.159
 the best but good for now by 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.709
 30 thousand coins or 50 thousand in play I think that 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.689
 ok I think it's worth a hundred 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.729
 per cent this team and well let's go 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.709
 with the line attack that good with this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.929
 line is that it is also amazing with 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.659
 these three beasts that are not at all 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.270
 slow as rhythm development and with 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.869
 that hawk that goes up two points 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.460
 they would stay 90 I think it's amazing 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.770
 front centralizes more of the same 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 I would give him alcohol to get him 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.990
 little the rhythm of the shot and finally 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.200
 this beast that is square this year the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.100
 true that very good deserves 100% worth 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.530
 and I think that 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.200
 Let's see if you have 20 thousand coins 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.230
 they spent the please please is great 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.640
 square and nothing guys I hope that you 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.930
 I liked the template I feel that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.270
 uploaded video but good as them 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.130
 have xbox one this I think is the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.680
 first video that I make on the computer 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.030
 Cuban direct so great guy if 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.590
