00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.799
 What's up guys talking? 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.710
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.349
 of black ops one year from today I bring 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.389
 for magni play somewhat 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.960
 strange at least at the beginning of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.600
 this gameplay did not start from one 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.699
 The way I wanted to at least not me 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.289
 I fucking ran the whole match and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.369
 now that I'm finding the first 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.960
 opponents, right? 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 Look at the crazy guy who 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.980
 We want to cross but out, man. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.510
 I'm going to barbecue on this game. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.250
 that is not 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 so I was running like hell 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.149
 almost a minute and a half there, yes I 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.239
 I loved being able to find my first 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.739
 opponent and beauty, I found my 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.760
 first opponent started killing 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.590
 Oscar Inn 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.140
 the thing more or less began to be 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 to draw a very natural shape I found 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 several means that then the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 staff began to sprout around and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.300
 this is cool because you do not need 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.309
 running desperately from 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.100
 one side of the map to the other is to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.049
 You can find the guys and look at them. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 cool guy fled he has and throw 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 flames that I ended up falling on the floor 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.070
 I made a barbecue and I got to know 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 the guy and I ended up being awarded with black 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.259
 gold and then you know black gold black ops 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 one makes all the difference is that you get 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.479
 identify the opponents of the mini map 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.310
 and it is very easy and as autocad 11 finishes the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.369
 Let's play even more so because 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.799
 today 11 is a weapon is very strong she 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 kills well near medium and long 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 distance is enough you have a good mine 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.500
 You get six super good with 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.030
 this weapon 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 I confess to you that my weapon 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.670
 favorite of all the safes r16 and already 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 They know this but I cut short. 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.229
 To play Blackjack 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.659
 she resembles very much is very similar 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.030
 one of the cool things that is very strong 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.229
 That's why I end up liking it then. 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.899
 play a little more 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.210
 I get it and then I can stay 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.310
 shooting shots there from average to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.140
 long distance from the opponent 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 another cool thing that in this game 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.899
 ended up helping me 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.690
 I was playing with some comrades. 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.420
 old-school staff 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.400
 I'm playing 360 as you know 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.140
 because my playstation 3 is broken 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.850
 I can not play online any more 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 transit and some friends ever 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.110
 I used to play chat types and chat 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.650
 but never played and all the staff 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.300
 35 years old so I'm older 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 enjoying playing with this galley 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.490
 that the cargo green beret or hello 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.650
 in the movie everything personal but older 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.950
 So let's just say that people who hit a 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.080
 Talk a little different more 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.790
 relaxed and then the staff 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.460
 cry the other gets pissed 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.080
 cheap is a cool thing then 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.060
 You do not have that commitment to 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.550
 always want to win as the gurizada 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.970
 new made new mpb and bossa nova that 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.230
 win that at last show skill 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.910
 flag the total 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.280
 and here we are playing the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.710
 Older tau people are more for us 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.810
 have fun to advance the side of the 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.490
 Other this I think is cool 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.980
 look at the guy who was happy with the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.930
 very crazy outcome i managed to kill him 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.210
 and I hope this game has no owner 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.489
 But I'm seeing it here in Vegas and locked 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.140
 She 's walking but I do not know. 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.120
 What is happening with my pc ? 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.739
 I think he's old, just like I 'm going to have. 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.230
 that to give a way of province in which 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.410
 this new concert in doing something 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.200
 that you have to let go and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.459
 I hope he is not going to hit the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 boots do not let the biggest party 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.989
 since avc has no problem in it 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.520
 Why, man, I 'm not in the mood to spend. 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.680
 to deliver at least I 'm not 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.920
 very much since you know that I 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.560
 I'm moving out of town yet I have not changed 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.180
 so I 'm here for now 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.130
 last week the internet via radio that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.500
 I already told you, I had to improve one. 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.130
 and then get to play a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.510
 little better 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.610
 There is a day when she is beautiful. 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.709
 She's bad that day she was cool. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.750
 're giving to play well to quiet 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.040
 you have an idea like this day to 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.840
 internet was cool even though it was a 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 via radio connection was yellow already 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.440
 are playing and gringo russia was 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.780
 getting to play super quiet 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.390
 it seemed like a connection to four green 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.260
 neighborhoods utinga shot shot took this 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.030
 It's very cool. 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.170
 The other internet even can 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.419
 connection fu 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.269
 I could not play that way though 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.060
 today Monday 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.620
 I tried to play naval strike on bs-4 not 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.150
 I got it too, it's very solid. 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.629
 connection gets too high 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.909
 The case is the LED is very high, right and I'm done. 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.500
 not being able to play but finally I hope 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.539
 During the week I can get 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.319
 play and bring to you is a kind of 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.240
 gameplay 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.069
 Finally I just wanted to bring a flu and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.199
 playing from 11 I ended up talking a lot of 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.270
 things a little random there, I hope 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.009
 You guys have enjoyed that game there. 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.990
 thank you for the company we are 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.990
