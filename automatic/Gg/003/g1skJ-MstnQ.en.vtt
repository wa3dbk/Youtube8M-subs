looks a bit different on 360 motion I
have<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.290> say<00:02:23.470> right<00:02:24.220> there<00:02:24.849> isn't<00:02:25.239> this

have to say right there isn't this
property<00:02:25.780> turn<00:02:25.989> here<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.640> let's<00:02:27.640> move<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
property turn here but let's move on to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.210 
property turn here but let's move on to
the<00:02:28.300> next<00:02:28.450> way<00:02:28.720> okay<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.530> fourth<00:02:29.800> glitch

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
the next way okay so the fourth glitch

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.979 
the next way okay so the fourth glitch
is<00:02:30.700> right<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.600> much

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
is right not much

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.250 
is right not much
and<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.890> fourth<00:02:33.100> glitch<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.790> here<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.900> cannot

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and the fourth glitch is here you cannot

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.550 
and the fourth glitch is here you cannot
do<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.459> 360<00:02:40.300> version<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:41.440> there

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
do this one on the 360 version but there

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.210 
do this one on the 360 version but there
is<00:02:41.650> another<00:02:41.890> way<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.130> getting<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.480> place

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
is another way of getting out this place

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.690 
is another way of getting out this place
on<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> 1060<00:02:45.880> version<00:02:46.209> which<00:02:46.360> will<00:02:46.630> be<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.050> my

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
on the 1060 version which will be in my

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.600 
on the 1060 version which will be in my
360<00:02:48.700> glitches<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.110> can<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.519> click<00:02:51.519> on

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
360 glitches so you can just click on

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.780 
360 glitches so you can just click on
the<00:02:51.850> link<00:02:52.060> below<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.870> find<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.540> yeah

so which one acute and downs come
speeding<00:02:59.159> down<00:02:59.340> here<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> very<00:02:59.940> fast<00:03:00.390> car

I'm just about hit this wall correctly

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.339 
I'm just about hit this wall correctly
see<00:03:08.060> basically<00:03:09.170> well<00:03:10.170> I'll<00:03:10.950> try<00:03:11.489> going<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:12.349> it

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
see basically well I'll try going up it

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.220 
see basically well I'll try going up it
does<00:03:13.590> take<00:03:13.799> your<00:03:14.040> attempts<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.730> railway

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
does take your attempts at the railway

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.509 
does take your attempts at the railway
glitch<00:03:16.230> I'll<00:03:16.470> try<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.709> one<00:03:16.830> more<00:03:16.860> time<00:03:17.010> and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
glitch I'll try it one more time and

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.070 
glitch I'll try it one more time and
check<00:03:17.940> out<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.209> Christine<00:03:18.599> we're<00:03:18.780> actually

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
check out and Christine we're actually

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.809 
check out and Christine we're actually
do<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:21.530> well<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.680> looks<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.519> cannot

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
just can't do it so you're gonna have to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.309 
just can't do it so you're gonna have to
try<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.019> out<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.290> yourself<00:03:28.650> guys<00:03:30.049> now<00:03:31.049> this

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319

our last clip should this video okay so

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.400 
our last clip should this video okay so
this<00:03:46.859> next<00:03:47.099> glitch<00:03:47.519> takes<00:03:48.000> part<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:52.290> know

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
this next glitch takes part and you know

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.530 
this next glitch takes part and you know
where<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.920> place<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.250> mum<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.150> nice<00:03:54.329> and

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
where this place is mum to be nice and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.900 
where this place is mum to be nice and
what<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.230> what<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.680> have<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.129> do<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.579> simply

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
what and what we have to do is simply

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:16.129 
what and what we have to do is simply
reverse<00:03:57.239> into<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.690> Spence<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.440> area

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.990 

of<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.500> captioner

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
of the captioner

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.970 
of the captioner
when<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.720> keeps<00:04:19.989> doing<00:04:20.230> this<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.650> know<00:04:20.799> you're

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
when it keeps doing this you know you're

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:32.510 
when it keeps doing this you know you're
doing

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.010 

can<00:04:33.520> hates<00:04:33.760> me

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
can hates me

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.710 
can hates me
Oh<00:04:36.099> try<00:04:37.099> it<00:04:37.129> analogies<00:04:37.789> okay<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.419> grab<00:04:38.690> my

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
Oh try it analogies okay so I grab my

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.020 
Oh try it analogies okay so I grab my
other<00:04:38.900> GTR<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:40.039> I'm<00:04:40.099> thinking<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.699> area

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
other GTR and I'm thinking the area

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.760 
other GTR and I'm thinking the area
might<00:04:41.270> actually<00:04:41.479> be<00:04:41.810> here<00:04:42.050> instead<00:04:42.319> of<00:04:42.470> over

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
might actually be here instead of over

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.020 
might actually be here instead of over
there<00:04:43.180> there's<00:04:44.180> only<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.599> way<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.780> find<00:04:44.990> out

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
there there's only one way to find out

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.520 
there there's only one way to find out
I've<00:04:47.030> actually<00:04:47.210> done<00:04:47.479> this<00:04:47.659> before<00:04:47.840> but<00:04:48.080> in

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
I've actually done this before but in

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:57.050 
I've actually done this before but in
this<00:04:49.520> GTR<00:04:49.940> so

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.650 

watch<00:04:57.570> me<00:04:58.190> try

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.210 

this<00:05:02.140> is<00:05:02.320> Tom

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220

I'm<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:07.910> going<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.090> keep<00:05:08.180> doing<00:05:08.240> this<00:05:08.570> no

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
I'm just going to keep doing this no

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.070 
I'm just going to keep doing this no
should<00:05:09.080> come<00:05:09.200> back<00:05:09.350> to<00:05:09.530> wonder<00:05:10.750> after<00:05:11.750> you

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
should come back to wonder after you

spend a really long time doing it you
actually<00:05:14.210> somehow<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.140> do<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.620> like<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.370> other

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
actually somehow to do it like the other

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.300 
actually somehow to do it like the other
glitches<00:05:16.970> but<00:05:17.570> yeah<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.320> did<00:05:19.160> it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
glitches but yeah I did it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.140
