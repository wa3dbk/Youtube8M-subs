cute on how awesome these times this is
one<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.400> best<00:04:04.639> Thomas<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.530> have<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:07.280> is

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
one of the best Thomas I have this is

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.030 
one of the best Thomas I have this is
premier<00:04:08.810> quality<00:04:09.260> Thomas<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.799> would<00:04:09.919> say

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
premier quality Thomas I would say

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.789 
premier quality Thomas I would say
almost<00:04:13.040> cannot<00:04:13.430> be<00:04:13.579> better<00:04:13.819> than<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.799> it's

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
almost cannot be better than this it's

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.890 
almost cannot be better than this it's
very<00:04:16.010> expensive<00:04:16.280> one<00:04:16.639> I<00:04:16.669> believe<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.630> it's<00:04:20.840> a

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
very expensive one I believe and it's a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:45.730 
very expensive one I believe and it's a
talking<00:04:21.280> light<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:44.000> very<00:04:44.389> accurately<00:04:45.380> made

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
talking light and very accurately made

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.120 
talking light and very accurately made
spotless<00:04:46.729> three<00:04:47.180> magnet<00:04:47.750> one

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.790 

so<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.310> doesn't<00:04:51.760> try<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.090> put<00:04:52.690> Thomas<00:04:52.960> back

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
so this doesn't try to put Thomas back

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.740 
so this doesn't try to put Thomas back
to<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.220> station<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.910> time<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.240> didn't<00:04:58.540> work

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
to the station this time you didn't work

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.130 
to the station this time you didn't work
so<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.410> going<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.740> try<00:05:00.010> again<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:01.660> has<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.990> be

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
so this going to try again it has to be

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.390 
so this going to try again it has to be
really<00:05:03.780> exact<00:05:04.780> way<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.110> believe<00:05:05.410> this<00:05:05.770> this

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
really exact way I believe this this

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.260 
really exact way I believe this this
time<00:05:06.640> it<00:05:06.790> might<00:05:07.120> work

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
time it might work

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.660 
time it might work
so<00:05:10.270> it<00:05:10.390> might<00:05:10.630> leave<00:05:11.440> Thomas<00:05:11.890> back<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.580> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
so it might leave Thomas back to the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.340 
so it might leave Thomas back to the
station<00:05:16.170> okay

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.040 

and<00:05:20.350> try<00:05:20.560> again

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
and try again

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.360 
and try again
