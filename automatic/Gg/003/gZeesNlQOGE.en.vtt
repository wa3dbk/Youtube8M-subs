00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.020
 green with 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.670
 is the youtube band already a 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.440
 after a long absence of no 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.180
 make tutorial videos so now they 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.540
 I bring a video like jenny without the title 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.370
 how to send whatsapp messages to a 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:30.920
 mobile phone alright I'll be fast and 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.620
 I'm going to explain something fast too and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.820
 something short so that you too can 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.989
 perform on your pc I explain 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.989
 when you have 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.980
 on your mobile phone there is already the option 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.270
 through a website of your 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.380
 pc or mobile phone 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.300
 for this we need the page 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.330
 in the description of the video I'm going to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.150
 leave the link of the page to which you are going 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.030
 to have to access and through my steps 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.280
 we will be able to make an example with my 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.160
 cell phone so you can see that this 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.930
 option if any programs work without 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.930
 nothing of facilities etc 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.670
 here I have the page already opened with a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.280
 phone we are going to write where the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.730
 name your name or whatever name 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.710
 what is desired 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.330
 if you take the country the mobile phone of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.260
 body that is located I'm going to put 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.260
 the phone 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 let's finally on the start button 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.740
 we'll see what they charge as they see charge 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.150
 something quick to you also like 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.340
 too fast depending on 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.020
 internet speed we will find it 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.909
 as the wallpaper with the nick 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.359
 which is the name that put them 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.229
 the mobile already with the code included by 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:02:00.700
 the country well let's do the example 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.700
 sending a hello message 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.340
 and we give in the send button 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.890
 wait for it to finish loading on 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.480
 uploaded the mobile phone volume for the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.920
 which is how they listened since it already issued 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.920
 the message and you played 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.950
 I will not see to be able to answer 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.209
 let's wait for it to come here in the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.209
 screen 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.770
 I delayed maybe by the telephone signal 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.770
 mobile 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.770
 well when he explained while getting off the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.530
 message appears to explain why these 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.630
 Two green check when sending the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.520
 first message in which you see sent 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.400
 that is, the mobile phone 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.980
 is going to appear one means that the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.950
 message was sent 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.560
 when the two checks appear he wants 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.950
 say because the one on the phone 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.100
 mobile already observed the whatsapp message 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.090
 but it does not ensure that he has read it 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.390
 let me understand that means that no 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.640
 it is sure that the one in the other 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.400
 extreme on the mobile phone wants 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.850
 say that you have read the message 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.170
 has only seen what I know of the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.040
 new interpreter phone has a 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.330
 flickering light only to mud 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.430
 He said there is a message and I leave it there 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.340
 I only notice that he has a message 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.320
 nothing more but did not see the content well 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.590
 it seems that for signal reason we got 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.590
 the message 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.769
 although the machine 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.900
 well I think it's already arrived I answered 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.900
 we have taken something of a minute 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.550
 as you see if it works and this is recontra 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.520
 easy and fast and simple without need 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.180
 to install anything other application that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.180
 I want to give 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:37.719
 only this page allows something of 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.719
 120 characters or letters 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.750
 you can not write a whole paragraph in 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.200
 do not sleep a lot, you can not, 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.810
 will be able to send the messages 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.490
 just like he's getting the message 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.409
 of receiving either can not write 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.059
 a lot here is not going to take full 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.669
 and another thing when we already had the one 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:03.460
 is where the message is being sent 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.350
 well 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.900
 when you're late without writing 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.910
 example because it is in your work I do not know 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.009
 where does not computer if it is not 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.500
 Chatting on another social network, what do I know? 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.530
 and you delay in answering the message or 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.630
 send a message by passing a minute or 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.580
 minute and a half or an approximate then the 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.009
 same page will send you a message 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.940
 telling you that you should update the 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:30.580
 page so that you restart again and 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.130
 will restart with your same nick and the 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.350
 mobile only we press that X 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:40.470
 incubated here with the update button 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.510
 good and pretty the same is for them 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.090
 be that was with the mobile phone 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.330
 if you answer that probably when 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.220
 the parties are updating 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.890
 probably no messages lost 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.320
 It is 100% sure that you have arrived 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.570
 maybe at this moment the one that is free 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.670
 was updated and then it was lost is the type 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.220
 of conversation is why I tell you 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.680
 this and they have few sentences not 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.110
 go over 120 characters well 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.620
 they can do everything for this video I 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.500
 I'm going to close and this page 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.169
