00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 when again a new video and today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.830
 have with you can learn from me 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.990
 Fridays and on Monday had exams 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.839
 So we have in fact written bwm 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 that needs to be described with that is 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:22.010
 It is that we have vocational training 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 approved for the ms or locksmith and 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.670
 write and yes there is thought here 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 to bring a video we have 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 actually already turned on friday 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.440
 if you see it as we do 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.149
 avoid another one in the pc 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 where he has ever shot and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.879
 the traffic situation has not saved 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.309
 and love to be something 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.960
 our first tip is empty piece of paper 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.489
 to make because if you learns with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
 marcel knew it is better 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.710
 memorize and that's why I do it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 also sometimes discover and then in the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 I can spend ten years later than that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.219
 just all the main points 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 all on one zdh and if you that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.609
 Write again then you get yourself 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.070
 even with a work white problem is 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.490
 while watching TV or something else 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.380
 or no youtube videos or us 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 You do not look because that's how you shape yourself 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.890
 so everything has most quiet it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.750
 is easy at a desk or 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 others in bed and write your whole 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.590
 race second and if is that you 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.930
 once he learns vocabulary now 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.540
 can you write to crawl and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 Are you doing in staircases if now 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 then we have his hits down 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.100
 The first word on it says enough 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.079
 it goes down again goes a room 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.730
 then my wife and so on 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:45.640
 he does the whole world 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.640
 So I have a staircase now 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.630
 So go on the stairs you go 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.060
 He signs up and writes 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.650
 apparent be other than udo kier 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.270
 lower part to have 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.190
 you say go up and recharge your batteries 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.890
 stones gravel next next on the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.340
 stairs and sauces and thus you know 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.740
 actually really good the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.380
 third tip is that you smell 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.020
 for example, I learned with the help of rumors 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.090
 if I just run a serious movie 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.740
 sprayed and its the same with on 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.300
 you can do better work 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.300
 bring in your due 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.750
 It reminds you of the scents in yours 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.650
 long matter so has taken and it 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.680
 if I stop at work 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.740
 it is exactly the same 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.450
 a tip for vocals could also be for something 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.820
 take another but you can to 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.500
 For example, vocabulary 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.120
 it also writes a clear note and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.970
 the glue sticks everywhere where he really is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.100
 Every day that's over at the door 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.440
 So a jack if you because of it 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.240
 goes out of a room says the word to you 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.060
 Well, if you could say then 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.080
 go on stairs everywhere where never 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.830
 wins is the new mobile via 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.290
 actually every day and so brings 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.810
 a very very good and important 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.760
 Tip is early enough if now 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.140
 a day or two days before work 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.720
 start or before the examination of a 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.000
 beginner to learn then it is 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.620
 It's not good because he has several days 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.250
 time and every day you can always 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.880
 theme 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.710
 and at the end there was again and so on 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.990
 can you yourselves entries it better 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.720
 that's why I prefer to learn 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.660

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.000

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.280
 Buy here again more exactly 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.680

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.250
