00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.440 
same thing or just make an important
that<00:01:59.820> works<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.960> fifth<00:02:01.710> layer<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:03.149> thing

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that works the fifth layer is this thing

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.780 
that works the fifth layer is this thing
it's<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> middle<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:05.579> with

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it's just like the middle you know with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's just like the middle you know with
the<00:02:05.820> door<00:02:06.380> separate<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the door separate you know so that you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.390 
the door separate you know so that you
know<00:02:08.160> you've<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.369> two<00:02:08.670> doors<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> TARDIS

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
know you've got two doors on the TARDIS

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.700 
know you've got two doors on the TARDIS
layer<00:02:11.400> 6<00:02:11.849> is

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
layer 6 is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.100 
layer 6 is
like<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:14.030> background<00:02:14.540> things

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
like the little background things

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.090 
like the little background things
because<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.440> don't<00:02:15.590> know<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.920> tell

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
because I don't know if you can tell

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.090 
because I don't know if you can tell
that<00:02:16.160> there's<00:02:16.400> actually<00:02:16.490> like<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.850> darker<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.890> a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
that there's actually like a darker in a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.880 
that there's actually like a darker in a
square<00:02:19.720> inside<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.960> TARDIS<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:23.180> know<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:24.530> just

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
square inside the TARDIS you know I just

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.680 
square inside the TARDIS you know I just
basic<00:02:25.400> did<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> same<00:02:25.790> thing<00:02:25.820> or<00:02:26.090> layer<00:02:26.240> 7

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
basic did the same thing or layer 7

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.350 
basic did the same thing or layer 7
that's<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.960> same<00:02:27.500> thing<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> other<00:02:28.070> side

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
that's the same thing on the other side

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.400 
that's the same thing on the other side
there's<00:02:29.360> quite<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> lot<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.810> those<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.230> should

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
there's quite a lot of those this should

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.800 
there's quite a lot of those this should
be<00:02:30.530> eight<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:31.070> them<00:02:31.190> all<00:02:31.280> together<00:02:31.570> guys<00:02:32.570> ate

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
be eight of them all together guys ate

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.860 
be eight of them all together guys ate
look<00:02:33.020> see<00:02:33.500> same<00:02:34.280> same<00:02:34.730> thing<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.390> put<00:02:35.780> it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
look see same same thing you just put it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.040 
look see same same thing you just put it
lower<00:02:35.990> down<00:02:36.290> try<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:36.830> get<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.750> right<00:02:38.750> size

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
lower down try and get it right size

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.270 
lower down try and get it right size
another<00:02:39.890> one<00:02:40.040> there<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.860> basically<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
another one there and you basically the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.810 
another one there and you basically the
idea<00:02:43.310> they're<00:02:44.240> all<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.480> same<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:46.430> these<00:02:46.670> are

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
idea they're all the same now these are

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.100 
idea they're all the same now these are
the<00:02:46.880> windows<00:02:47.270> they're<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.780> they're<00:02:48.080> just

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
the windows they're just they're just

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.540 
the windows they're just they're just
white<00:02:48.380> squares<00:02:48.830> basically<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.400> same<00:02:49.490> as

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
white squares basically the same as

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.270 
white squares basically the same as
these<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.510> other<00:02:51.230> panels<00:02:51.590> at<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.740> back<00:02:51.920> same

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
these the other panels at the back same

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.640 
these the other panels at the back same
as<00:02:52.430> those<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:52.970> slightly<00:02:53.780> smaller<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.500> fit

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
as those but slightly smaller and fit

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.520 
as those but slightly smaller and fit
inside<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.400> they're<00:02:55.820> white<00:02:56.000> obviously<00:02:56.530> more

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
inside and they're white obviously more

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.430 
inside and they're white obviously more
gray<00:02:57.830> actually<00:02:58.750> i'm<00:02:59.750> going<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.050> show<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.200> what

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
gray actually i'm going to show you what

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.050 
gray actually i'm going to show you what
colors<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.770> use<00:03:00.920> i<00:03:01.250> guess<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.760> could<00:03:01.880> just

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
colors to use i guess you could just

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.850 
colors to use i guess you could just
look<00:03:02.300> at<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.450> google<00:03:02.810> image<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> title

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
look at a google image of what the title

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.170 
look at a google image of what the title
is<00:03:03.950> inside<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.340> mind<00:03:04.550> I've<00:03:04.760> even<00:03:05.000> got<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
is inside I mind I've even got the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.200 
is inside I mind I've even got the
colors<00:03:05.420> right<00:03:05.450> myself<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.170> just<00:03:06.380> went<00:03:06.620> with<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
colors right myself I just went with the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.330 
colors right myself I just went with the
best-looking<00:03:08.210> colors<00:03:09.160> same<00:03:10.160> with<00:03:10.310> that

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
best-looking colors same with that

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.820 
best-looking colors same with that
window<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:10.880> well<00:03:11.030> as<00:03:11.150> exactly<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.750> same<00:03:11.990> you

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
window as well as exactly the same you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.240 
window as well as exactly the same you
just<00:03:12.860> stick<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.490> there<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.330> line<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
just stick it there and line it up the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.840 
just stick it there and line it up the
sign<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:17.410> very<00:03:18.410> similar<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.860> windows<00:03:19.310> just

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
sign is very similar to the windows just

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.570 
sign is very similar to the windows just
a<00:03:19.940> bit<00:03:20.090> smaller<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.600> narrower<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:22.250> gray

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
a bit smaller and narrower and it's gray

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.280 
a bit smaller and narrower and it's gray
looks<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.630> darker<00:03:26.050> that's<00:03:27.050> not<00:03:27.260> the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
looks like a darker that's not the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.170 
looks like a darker that's not the
little<00:03:27.590> handle<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.250> door<00:03:28.460> no<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.090> see

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
little handle on the door no if you see

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.840 
little handle on the door no if you see
a<00:03:29.300> little<00:03:29.630> tiny<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:31.550> stick<00:03:31.820> that

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
a little tiny then you just stick that

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.910 
a little tiny then you just stick that
on<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.330> side<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.810> door<00:03:32.990> I<00:03:33.170> think<00:03:33.530> it's<00:03:33.800> on

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
on this side of the door I think it's on

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.960 
on this side of the door I think it's on
that<00:03:34.010> side<00:03:35.080> that's<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.260> keyhole<00:03:36.740> I<00:03:37.010> did<00:03:37.850> that

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
that side that's the keyhole I did that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.340 
that side that's the keyhole I did that
in<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.210> bit<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.450> detail<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.990> know<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.140> didn't

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
in is a bit of detail you know I didn't

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.110 
in is a bit of detail you know I didn't
have<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:41.740> that's<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:43.040> ELSA<00:03:43.550> that's<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.940> big

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
have to that's the ELSA that's the big

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.890 
have to that's the ELSA that's the big
blue<00:03:44.660> bar<00:03:44.930> across<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> top<00:03:46.330> big<00:03:47.330> thick<00:03:47.630> part

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
blue bar across the top big thick part

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.180 
blue bar across the top big thick part
of<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.080> TARDIS<00:03:49.570> that's<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.810> black<00:03:51.380> sign<00:03:51.800> part

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
of the TARDIS that's the black sign part

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.850 
of the TARDIS that's the black sign part
where<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.240> sticky<00:03:53.960> label<00:03:54.380> thing<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.710> or

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.710 
whatever let me know how to describe it
that's<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.220> it's<00:03:58.940> quite<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.120> few<00:03:59.300> layers<00:03:59.450> on

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
that's the it's quite a few layers on

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.040 
that's the it's quite a few layers on
this<00:03:59.870> bit<00:04:00.050> that's<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.190> smaller<00:04:02.050> thick

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
this bit that's like a smaller thick

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.950 
this bit that's like a smaller thick
piece<00:04:03.320> of<00:04:03.530> just<00:04:04.280> above<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:05.170> thicker<00:04:06.170> one<00:04:07.960> then

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
piece of just above the thicker one then

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.060 
piece of just above the thicker one then
once<00:04:09.260> again<00:04:09.620> another<00:04:10.040> one<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.720> then<00:04:11.920> just<00:04:12.920> as

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
once again another one and then just as

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.039 
once again another one and then just as
a<00:04:13.390> hold<00:04:14.390> on<00:04:15.220> right<00:04:16.220> this<00:04:16.640> is<00:04:16.790> like<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.270> outside

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
a hold on right this is like the outside

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.770 
a hold on right this is like the outside
layer<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.859> torch<00:04:19.190> like<00:04:19.430> it's<00:04:19.580> just<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
layer of the torch like it's just the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.060 
layer of the torch like it's just the
light<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.230> top<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.530> tile<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:21.890> just

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
light on the top of the tile it's just

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.060 
light on the top of the tile it's just
that<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.760> blue<00:04:23.380> outline<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.410> suppose<00:04:24.830> you

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
that the blue outline of suppose you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.400 
that the blue outline of suppose you
can't<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:25.340> see<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.700> much

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
can't really see it that much

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.900 
can't really see it that much
it's<00:04:26.860> kind<00:04:26.980> of<00:04:27.100> pointless<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.610> put<00:04:27.730> in<00:04:27.850> I

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
it's kind of pointless to put in I

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.240 
it's kind of pointless to put in I
suppose<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:29.020> we<00:04:29.140> see<00:04:29.820> TV<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.830> lights<00:04:33.070> just

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
suppose can we see TV the lights just

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.340 
suppose can we see TV the lights just
basically<00:04:33.730> made<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:34.060> two<00:04:34.330> two<00:04:35.050> different

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
basically made of two two different

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.680 
basically made of two two different
colors<00:04:35.650> as<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> dark<00:04:36.520> yellow<00:04:36.790> that's<00:04:37.540> the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
colors as a dark yellow that's the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.640 
colors as a dark yellow that's the
bigger<00:04:37.960> part<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:40.180> then<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.050> lighter<00:04:41.290> yellows

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
bigger part and then the lighter yellows

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.950 
bigger part and then the lighter yellows
in<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.920> middle<00:04:42.190> smaller<00:04:42.810> basically<00:04:43.810> just

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
in the middle smaller basically just

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.330 
in the middle smaller basically just
looks<00:04:44.110> like<00:04:44.230> it<00:04:44.380> gives<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.710> more<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.920> a<00:04:45.040> shine

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
looks like it gives it more of a shine

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.100 
looks like it gives it more of a shine
to<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.910> torches<00:04:46.360> actually<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.870> the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
to it like the torches actually on the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.160 
to it like the torches actually on the
light<00:04:47.940> now<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.000> writing<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:50.080> an

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
light now the writing this is an

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.350 
light now the writing this is an
interesting<00:04:50.440> thing<00:04:50.830> there's<00:04:51.040> no<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:52.000> would<00:04:52.210> I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
interesting thing there's no it would I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.610 
interesting thing there's no it would I
wouldn't<00:04:52.780> have<00:04:52.870> had<00:04:52.960> enough<00:04:53.170> layers<00:04:53.380> to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
wouldn't have had enough layers to

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.530 
wouldn't have had enough layers to
actually<00:04:53.890> write<00:04:54.160> things<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.730> police<00:04:55.330> public

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
actually write things like police public

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.230 
actually write things like police public
cool<00:04:55.840> box<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.380> i<00:04:56.410> just<00:04:56.860> use<00:04:57.100> these<00:04:57.280> layers<00:04:57.910> to

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
cool box so i just use these layers to

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.600 
cool box so i just use these layers to
like<00:04:58.390> squiggly<00:04:59.020> scribble<00:04:59.920> things<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.430> should

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
like squiggly scribble things you should

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.360 
like squiggly scribble things you should
find<00:05:00.790> them<00:05:00.970> easy<00:05:01.090> enough<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:02.070> basically<00:05:03.070> i

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
find them easy enough and basically i

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.420 
find them easy enough and basically i
just<00:05:03.780> walked<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.140> shape<00:05:05.410> how<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.250> do<00:05:06.400> that

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
just walked the shape how do you do that

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.290 
just walked the shape how do you do that
um<00:05:07.950> he's<00:05:08.950> warp<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.520> shape<00:05:09.700> just<00:05:09.880> get<00:05:10.060> it<00:05:10.150> to

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
um he's warp the shape just get it to

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.430 
um he's warp the shape just get it to
the<00:05:10.390> right<00:05:10.560> size<00:05:12.870> it's<00:05:13.870> basically<00:05:14.230> that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
the right size it's basically that

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.350 
the right size it's basically that
pattern<00:05:14.980> thing<00:05:15.100> I'm<00:05:15.370> not<00:05:15.670> sure<00:05:15.850> how<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.030> warp

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
pattern thing I'm not sure how to warp

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.030 
pattern thing I'm not sure how to warp
the<00:05:16.420> shape<00:05:16.810> it's<00:05:17.080> been<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.350> while<00:05:17.620> since<00:05:17.860> I've

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
the shape it's been a while since I've

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.080 
the shape it's been a while since I've
played<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.930> but<00:05:19.930> um<00:05:20.310> it's<00:05:21.310> fairly<00:05:21.850> simple

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
played this but um it's fairly simple

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.480 
played this but um it's fairly simple
enough<00:05:22.390> you<00:05:22.540> just<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:23.200> just<00:05:23.230> line<00:05:23.590> up<00:05:23.620> put<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
enough you just you just line up put it

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.510 
enough you just you just line up put it
in<00:05:24.580> place<00:05:24.790> and<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:25.360> acts<00:05:25.570> as<00:05:25.780> writing<00:05:26.520> pretty

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
in place and it acts as writing pretty

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.450 
in place and it acts as writing pretty
simple<00:05:27.880> I'm<00:05:28.030> sure<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.300> can<00:05:28.450> work<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.750> out<00:05:29.460> how

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
simple I'm sure you can work it out how

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.110 
simple I'm sure you can work it out how
to<00:05:30.520> stick<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:30.940> back<00:05:31.090> there<00:05:32.640> be<00:05:33.640> this<00:05:33.820> is<00:05:33.970> also

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
to stick that back there be this is also

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.940 
to stick that back there be this is also
writing<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.780> is<00:05:34.930> on<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.140> sign<00:05:35.410> it's<00:05:35.770> just

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
writing this is on the sign it's just

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.790 
writing this is on the sign it's just
basically<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.430> smaller<00:05:36.760> version<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.360> top

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
basically a smaller version of the top

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.460 
basically a smaller version of the top
writing<00:05:38.800> across<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.250> door<00:05:39.990> I've<00:05:40.990> got<00:05:41.200> four<00:05:41.440> of

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
writing across the door I've got four of

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.290 
writing across the door I've got four of
those<00:05:41.680> just<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.640> make<00:05:42.669> it<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:43.000> know<00:05:43.030> better

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
those just to make it you know better

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.740 
those just to make it you know better
and<00:05:43.740> these<00:05:44.740> last<00:05:45.070> two<00:05:45.340> pieces<00:05:45.610> are<00:05:46.090> just<00:05:46.270> the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
and these last two pieces are just the

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.470 
and these last two pieces are just the
bottom<00:05:47.050> part<00:05:47.290> of<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.500> TARDIS<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.280> big<00:05:48.640> what

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
bottom part of the TARDIS the big what

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.040 
bottom part of the TARDIS the big what
the<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:50.340> step<00:05:51.340> if<00:05:51.610> you<00:05:51.760> like<00:05:51.970> and<00:05:52.240> this<00:05:52.990> is

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
the the step if you like and this is

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.659 
the the step if you like and this is
just<00:05:53.320> like<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.560> bit<00:05:53.830> of<00:05:53.919> detail<00:05:54.250> like<00:05:54.400> a<00:05:54.430> bit<00:05:54.580> of

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
just like a bit of detail like a bit of

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.180 
just like a bit of detail like a bit of
shadowing<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:56.020> separates<00:05:56.650> those<00:05:56.919> two

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
shadowing that separates those two

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.450 
shadowing that separates those two
layers<00:05:57.490> a<00:05:57.640> top<00:05:58.030> you<00:05:58.810> can<00:05:59.080> see<00:05:59.169> that<00:05:59.470> so<00:06:00.280> there's
