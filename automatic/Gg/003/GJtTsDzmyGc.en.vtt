00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.249

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.020
 Let's go to the ingredients first, you go.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.610

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.440
 and you're going to need a zombie with life. 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.460
 Gotta be a living zombie can not 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.330
 leave more than the club will not 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.250
 disturb 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.870
 and you will also need the turbine 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.490
 that everyone knows I mount 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.449
 I do not even think I'm going to show it to you. 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.350
 Are you riding her fast? 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.850
 are the ingredients that you will 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.280
 needing you will need me too 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.469
 one point left after you go 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.390
 having to open a door in front and 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.899
 catch the bridge has no minimum round to 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.579
 You do, and it's very simple anyway. 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.589
 But there are some people who have not yet 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.679
 You know then I 'm here to try to help. 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.109
 You guys riding the turbine everybody. 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:00.339
 never that part will have to get out of there 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:04.140
 It's going to catch busÃ£o, it 's normal. 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.610
 And then beauty took the bus will have a 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.100
 two three 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.640
 in the fourth stop you will stop there in that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.950
 place and it is a place that you 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.420
 energy will you open that door will 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.890
 get in there and you will have to 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 because you will have energy 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.360
 because otherwise you can not get out 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.289
 There's another way but it 's kind of 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.119
 complicated 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.270
 finally gave shows energy and 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.979
 lightning fast beauty turned on the energy is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.530
 why energy will open that door 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.789
 there on the side 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.590
 but anyway what we will need 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.509
 I'll show you around here. 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.579
 Little Beauty League and Power Waits 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.590
 to get a shock out there is not much 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.600
 beauty problem you'll have to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.280
 bring your friend here he has to be 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.990
 with the turbine remembering 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.210
 the turbine you set up in the beginning has 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.070
 that being with him and the zombie has to be 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.200
 I live only a zombie, otherwise you will have 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.509
 even work because tinnitus can 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.820
 destroy your turbine and you leave your 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.859
 turbine and asks for your friend is there. 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.020
 give April preference because it is 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.379
 so you can play pant because otherwise 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.590
 I zombied can destroy for me I do not know 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.960
 who has got another way yes but before 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.410
 that's the easiest way I guess 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.660
 and finally, beauty, your friend rode 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.340
 turbine there now you'll do what 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.470
 You're going to catch bus and next stop. 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.090
 that there will let you enter the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.810
 safe as you enter the safe plays a 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.970
 grenade 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.950
 there will be another entry in the safe play 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.680
 the other grenade exploded at two 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.310
 entries are going to enter here beauty and yours 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.190
 friend will put the turbine there when 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.200
 will happen 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.460
 magic is important the staff that each 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.350
 one has to be in place because it is 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.140
 turbine can stop working there then 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.060
 It's good, but it's very simple, it's just you. 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.100
 assemble the parts are all down there 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.080
 nothing very complicated nothing very difficult 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.760
 you put the pieces together and put them on the table 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.880
 like in any other gadget 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.880
 this map is very easy 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.270
 the first part that is the machine is thus 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.940
 huh 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.380
 now I'm going to get the lipitor and fall there 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.060
 Anyway, I did not need the help anymore. 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.830
 it then be broken into 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.390
 brinks the battery which are three parts is 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.360
 very simple 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:25.310
 There is not much secret to riding another one. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.030
 share the beauty now missing a part 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.080

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.900
 reminding staff that I do not know the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.480
 women can be up to is sometimes these 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.100
