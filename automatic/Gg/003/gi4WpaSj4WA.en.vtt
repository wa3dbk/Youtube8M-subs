00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.280 

the<00:00:01.589> first<00:00:01.860> step<00:00:02.399> would<00:00:02.850> be<00:00:02.909> creating<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.870> new

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
the first step would be creating a new

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.220 
the first step would be creating a new
project<00:00:05.420> let's<00:00:06.420> specify<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:08.040> dimension

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.050 

press<00:00:13.230> create<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:15.360> now<00:00:15.690> let's<00:00:16.289> simply<00:00:17.100> click

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
press create and now let's simply click

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.060 
press create and now let's simply click
the<00:00:18.390> circle<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.529> example<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> new

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the circle for example so we get a new

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.930 
the circle for example so we get a new
object<00:00:23.390> we<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.630> rename<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.350 

we<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.840> customize<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.740 

let's<00:00:38.520> double<00:00:39.520> click

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.950 

and<00:00:43.840> we<00:00:44.830> get<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.310> key<00:00:45.610> frame<00:00:46.000> where<00:00:46.510> we<00:00:46.810> have

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
and we get a key frame where we have

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.550 
and we get a key frame where we have
this<00:00:47.620> circle<00:00:48.370> now<00:00:48.880> let's<00:00:49.180> take<00:00:49.480> this<00:00:49.720> slider

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
this circle now let's take this slider

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:59.220 
this circle now let's take this slider
to<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.550> right<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:55.440> specify<00:00:57.120> by<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.540> simple

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
to the right and specify by a simple

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.630 
to the right and specify by a simple
double<00:00:59.650> click<00:01:00.120> another<00:01:01.120> keyframe<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.890> that

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
double click another keyframe now that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.210 
double click another keyframe now that
we<00:01:03.820> focus<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.690> other<00:01:04.900> key<00:01:05.440> frame<00:01:05.800> let's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
we focus on the other key frame let's

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.960 
we focus on the other key frame let's
take<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:07.630> circle<00:01:09.150> away<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:12.610> the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
take this circle away and see the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.840 
take this circle away and see the
outcome

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.090 

here<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.110> press<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:21.409> column<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> get

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
here we can press this column and get

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
here we can press this column and get
the<00:01:23.700> line<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.509> shows<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:26.040> direction<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the line that shows the direction of the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.660 
the line that shows the direction of the
circle<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.950> play<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:31.670> introduce

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
circle we can play with it introduce

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.980 
circle we can play with it introduce
changes<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.420> outcome<00:01:37.190> now<00:01:38.190> if<00:01:38.990> we

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
changes this is the outcome now if we

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.450 
changes this is the outcome now if we
try<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.640> export<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.970> project<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.979> shall<00:01:44.220> get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
try to export the project we shall get

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
try to export the project we shall get
the<00:01:44.880> HTML<00:01:45.630> code<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.940> CSS<00:01:47.940> 3<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:49.530> the
