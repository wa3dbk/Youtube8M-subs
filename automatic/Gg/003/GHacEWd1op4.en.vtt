00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
so here we are the scrapyard this is a

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.519 
so here we are the scrapyard this is a
gravity<00:00:14.470> gun<00:00:14.500> my<00:00:14.710> father<00:00:14.920> was<00:00:15.130> talking<00:00:15.550> about

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
gravity gun my father was talking about

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.929 
gravity gun my father was talking about
you<00:00:17.529> can<00:00:17.679> call<00:00:17.830> it<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.009> zero-point<00:00:18.609> energy

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
you can call it the zero-point energy

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.939 
you can call it the zero-point energy
for<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.240> manipulator<00:00:19.720> if<00:00:19.960> you<00:00:20.349> really<00:00:20.769> want

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
for the manipulator if you really want

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.880 
for the manipulator if you really want
to<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:22.449> designed<00:00:22.960> for<00:00:23.140> handling<00:00:23.679> hazardous

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
to it's designed for handling hazardous

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.609 
to it's designed for handling hazardous
materials<00:00:24.699> but<00:00:25.359> we<00:00:25.689> mainly<00:00:25.900> use<00:00:26.050> it<00:00:26.289> for<00:00:26.470> heavy

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
materials but we mainly use it for heavy

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.859 
materials but we mainly use it for heavy
lifting<00:00:27.329> give<00:00:28.329> it<00:00:28.449> a<00:00:28.509> try<00:00:30.569> the<00:00:31.569> primary

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
lifting give it a try the primary

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.590 
lifting give it a try the primary
trigger<00:00:32.290> emits<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.770> charge<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:34.149> can<00:00:34.300> punch

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
trigger emits a charge you can punch

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.619 
trigger emits a charge you can punch
stop<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.050> send<00:00:35.230> it<00:00:35.320> flying<00:00:35.410> I<00:00:36.090> found<00:00:37.090> it<00:00:37.270> handy

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
stop and send it flying I found it handy

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:46.470 
stop and send it flying I found it handy
for<00:00:37.809> clearing<00:00:38.140> minefields

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.060 

so<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.630> secondary<00:00:48.230> trigger<00:00:48.440> lets<00:00:48.740> you<00:00:48.860> grab

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
so the secondary trigger lets you grab

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.750 
so the secondary trigger lets you grab
those<00:00:49.340> you<00:00:50.090> can<00:00:50.240> throw<00:00:50.270> them<00:00:50.660> from<00:00:50.900> prior<00:00:51.760> once

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
those you can throw them from prior once

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.370 
those you can throw them from prior once
you<00:00:52.880> pick<00:00:53.060> something<00:00:53.450> up<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.870> can<00:00:54.020> drop<00:00:54.200> it

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
you pick something up you can drop it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.810 
you pick something up you can drop it
gently<00:00:54.680> by<00:00:54.920> pressing<00:00:55.340> your<00:00:55.430> secondary

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
gently by pressing your secondary

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.000

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
trigger again pick up some stuff and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:13.420 
trigger again pick up some stuff and
toss<00:00:58.160> it<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:12.140> can<00:01:12.290> also<00:01:12.470> pull<00:01:12.920> stuff<00:01:13.160> over

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
toss it you can also pull stuff over

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:30.969 
toss it you can also pull stuff over
from<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.670> distance<00:01:14.090> give<00:01:15.050> it<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.230> try<00:01:29.830> see<00:01:30.830> if<00:01:30.860> you
