00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 when cross-country skiing becomes a passion 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.680
 then we are straight in angerberg 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.460
 right 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.490
 because there is anna wittmer at home and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440
 only one goal has the children of her 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.340
 hometown community for this sport too 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.900
 excite 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.640
 the cross-country skiing is really one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 passion so that is still the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 family is still a profession 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.500
 really a hobby where employment 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.150
 it has just really scary because 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 you just make fun of it too 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 Children as much as possible at how to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.059
 Just bring this fun to the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.450
 Exercise this fun at the sport 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.399
 to pass 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.620
 anna widmann is himself multiple 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.059
 tyrolean champion multiple vice 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.940
 state champions inside and scale 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.730
 state master in langlaufen it for example very much 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.850
 hurts if all this doping affair and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.969
 just the whole again and again 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.170
 Sport presented negatively and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.270
 discussed 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.329
 as a passionate cross-country skier 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.129
 really because you are there with a heart 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.159
 he then but who is the partially 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.350
 athletes then join in and me 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.820
 just think it is not quite so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 it's fair and i like it easy 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 very important and I am very happy 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 hurts how does he look if they are angerberg 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.180
 his junior coach of the year 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.220
 yes you have just recently learned 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.119
 that the plant as a junior trainer 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 has been chosen 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.460
 of course, it makes him a club leader 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.770
 very proud because it is always so wise 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.350
 This is what volunteer club does 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.079
 one says that is also seen and if 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.890
 that is seen and if only it 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.110
 is recognized and maybe only 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 for the honor of a trainer is where you 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.409
 says he really has been for 20 years 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.420
 herzblut in the long run already covers 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 me, of course, especially because this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.299
 not that we are doing this year and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 this our reward as the husband sees 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.479
 by anna wittmer the junior trainer 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.649
 of the year 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.509
 Of course, this is only possible if you 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.280
 somehow these common interests 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.570
 otherwise you would actually have it 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.549
 not so bad professionally much on the way 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.860
 you go to the club all the time 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.190
 So that was a relationship where you 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 For years, that would be because of us 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.060
 Together they bring the whole thing 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.530
 training but in winter for example 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.360
 different trainings even if that 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.660
 together and it's fun and before the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.489
 common interests and that fits 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.319
 all heard and what is the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.200
 junior trainer of the year 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.180
 training in the foreground ready to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.370
 it's just often that move 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.470
 The environment often just plays the game so much 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.470
 more with that and just the kids then 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.040
 really the joy of moving a lot 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.380
 fun 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.310
 which is really easy to pick apart 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.260
 and just really show where they are 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.049
 can learn what they can do 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.959
 that's just what i just love 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.120
 scary good discipline is important 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.930
 also in sports so I just think 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.290
 that he explains certain respect 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.390
 and with fun but also with respect to me 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.840
 has to be a bit of a balance 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.580
 hold 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.010
 It must be a bit too fit now 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.920
 must harmonize the whole if it is one 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.760
 offer a national came to 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.459
 take over 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.260
 would you be ready that will not do 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.590
 actually working with me 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.829
 Children are already very much there 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.079
 is simple you are in the village quite whole 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.299
 Anescht integrated it is with me 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.890
 already over generation so now 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.390
 meanwhile , the children of 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.590
 my first cross-country kids already 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.829
 again for training 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.840
 and then this is something like the victory you 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.819
 I need you to do it right because I am 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.920
 do not give my child anywhere where it is 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.900
 you do not have to be deaf or yourself either 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.609
 But you do not have to give it like that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.829
 see the children of the training group of 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.190
 anna wittmer her junior trainer 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.190
 of the year
