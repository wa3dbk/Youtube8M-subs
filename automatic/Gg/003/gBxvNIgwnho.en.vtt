make dumb decisions at times but
sometimes<00:02:27.470> it's<00:02:27.650> okay<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:29.360> when<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.810> does

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
sometimes it's okay but when that does

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.290 
sometimes it's okay but when that does
happen<00:02:30.340> again<00:02:31.340> don't<00:02:31.819> feel<00:02:32.030> bad<00:02:32.269> about

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
happen again don't feel bad about

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.270 
happen again don't feel bad about
bailing<00:02:32.840> out<00:02:33.140> I've<00:02:33.409> been<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:33.830> group<00:02:34.069> rides

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
bailing out I've been on group rides

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.300 
bailing out I've been on group rides
before<00:02:34.519> where<00:02:34.670> I've<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:34.819> freaking<00:02:35.330> left

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
before where I've just freaking left

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.430 
before where I've just freaking left
because<00:02:37.310> everyone<00:02:37.730> was<00:02:37.909> being<00:02:38.120> an<00:02:38.540> asshat<00:02:39.049> in

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
because everyone was being an asshat in

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.430 
because everyone was being an asshat in
the<00:02:39.799> group<00:02:39.980> ride

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
the group ride

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560 
the group ride
now<00:02:42.040> typically<00:02:42.490> what<00:02:42.700> happens<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.210> there's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
now typically what happens is there's

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.970 
now typically what happens is there's
different<00:02:43.990> groups<00:02:44.200> right<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.710> there's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
different groups right so there's

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.980 
different groups right so there's
beginners<00:02:45.520> intermediates<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:46.690> people

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
beginners intermediates and then people

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.260 
beginners intermediates and then people
that<00:02:47.230> ride<00:02:47.410> very<00:02:47.680> aggressively<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.060> that's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
that ride very aggressively and that's

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.880 
that ride very aggressively and that's
fine<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.690> usually<00:02:50.050> we'll<00:02:50.200> be<00:02:50.320> able<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.620> find

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
fine and usually we'll be able to find

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.940 
fine and usually we'll be able to find
out<00:02:51.040> who's<00:02:51.630> riding<00:02:52.630> skill<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.110> what<00:02:53.410> within

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
out who's riding skill is what within

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.830 
out who's riding skill is what within
the<00:02:54.070> first<00:02:54.280> 30<00:02:54.550> minutes<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.210> ride<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the first 30 minutes of the ride and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.210 
the first 30 minutes of the ride and
then<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.320> hang<00:02:56.500> out<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:56.980> pack

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
then you kind of hang out with that pack

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.160 
then you kind of hang out with that pack
whether<00:02:57.550> it's<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.270> know<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.990> back

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
whether it's in you know the the back

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.320 
whether it's in you know the the back

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
you get to figure out which group that

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.550 
you get to figure out which group that
you<00:03:13.060> fall<00:03:13.270> into<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.960> start<00:03:14.200> riding<00:03:14.350> with

them and you ride with the group that
you're<00:03:15.850> most<00:03:16.000> comfortable<00:03:16.210> with<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.840> I'm<00:03:17.410> not

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
you're most comfortable with so I'm not

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.560 
you're most comfortable with so I'm not
saying<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:17.890> by<00:03:18.100> class<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.210> actual

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
saying that by class of the actual

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.390 
saying that by class of the actual
engine<00:03:19.840> size<00:03:20.050> is<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.920> group<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.280> you're

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
engine size is the group that you're

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.610 
engine size is the group that you're
gonna<00:03:21.610> end<00:03:21.790> up<00:03:21.910> riding<00:03:22.120> with<00:03:22.420> usually<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.470> will

gonna end up riding with usually it will

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.870 
gonna end up riding with usually it will
be<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.920> majority<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.670> group<00:03:24.940> but

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
be the majority of that group but

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.700
