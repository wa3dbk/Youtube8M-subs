00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.230
 he will not have 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.290

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.100
 of cross who week by week short that the canton will have clips at the height 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.790
 why I explain myself 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.570

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.680
 bugatti well that's not a concern of the world are constructive 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.190
 the problem is that I put the most beautiful clips that I have in my box 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.830
 lead and I look at all the images of the arroyo beastly young man of all 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.770
 images knowing that sometimes people are done you break little ass really 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.330

 I put the most beautiful 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.530
 the problem is that if I have no I will not play your place it is patillo 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.360
 the whole team who is and who if we were going to take in maths and play your 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.630
 place so c to you for francophone committee% to 6 wanted to appear on 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.599
 the team of the day if he admits to move a little bit his thumbs 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.319
 move the valette a bit and make something pretty 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.560
 for its part conceded times where the team are very beautiful and I hear 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.359
 the critics I say shit in France we are in France 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.049
 the Francophone community is really pgm because honestly 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.499
 the teams that are criticized 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.419
 have to stop anyway honestly be a little serious and loot 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.159
 it's always nice to see a little guide when we come back from the taff or 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:34.849
 school 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.769
 so stopped since to criticize forgiveness 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.869
 thirty is 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.599
 like that in your footsteps with like it's not worth it and when you 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 say anything because that's what some critics 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.149
 I see human life 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:52.009
 they published in the video phew they are not even bothered to 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.439
 describe and give the link of their chain 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.429
 and even times the article is really 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.059
 so do not live up to it so please 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.229
 be a little honest with everyone 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:04.739
 do not say anything 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.749
 after acceptance and clips of the ouf but you must be mistaken for addressed 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.059
 e-mail because I never see 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.999
 so be aware that now pay attention 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.999
 e I am the game well we want to please you 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.560
 but we can not increase then 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.519
 but we can not find the team that does not exist 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.669
 so here at least I hope that today you're the one 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.219
