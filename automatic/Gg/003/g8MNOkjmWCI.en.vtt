00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
with something where you could take that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
with something where you could take that
generated<00:01:11.580> energy<00:01:11.790> somewhere<00:01:12.210> else<00:01:12.450> i'll

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
generated energy somewhere else i'll

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
generated energy somewhere else i'll
whip<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.229> good<00:01:13.320> thing<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.820> after
