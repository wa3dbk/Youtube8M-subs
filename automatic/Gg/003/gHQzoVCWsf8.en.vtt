00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 yes hello and servus today is about that 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 sorry summer theme of the smelly 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.550
 Air conditioning and I'll show you the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.830
 Disinfection at a 90 3 he bmw the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
 behind me is my very first video 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.150
 yes was the climate disinfection at my 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 46 at first a little wooden 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.730
 and from the bottom technical view 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.320
 not so the hit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.270
 That's why I'll show you two today 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 different methods like yours 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 disinfection can do and indeed 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.849
 it is in this case so that in the climate 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 operation itself so active 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 Air conditioning only three 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.730
 but smells after switching off the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 Air conditioning is a real lousy 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 moist and creamy foot odor 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 disseminated and so should before 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 Disinfection of the climate evaporator 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.800
 The temperature was dry 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.739
 the blower is at the highest level 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.020
 on the foot area and gives the strength 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.539
 the blower to maximum then still the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.219
 activate balance door and wait 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.800
 The then about ten minutes until the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.750
 has dried around at the 90 one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.539
 climate evaporator you have to come to the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.609
 220 yorks once here and once here 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.040
 solve and cover under the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.420
 Slimming glove box so after that you can 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.140
 her after how that solved that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 Unhook the entire cut out and the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.219
 covers 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.500
 to evaporate at the mouth to 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:19.610
 you have to come this temperature sensor 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 So here with the plug and the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.929
 Tear off the yellow-brown cable at the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.820
 best unplug the plug before 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.140
 sensor and then the sensor itself 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.039
 we just pull it out 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.229
 adjusted 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.030
 in the choice of disinfectant 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.530
 you'll probably wake up most of the time 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.679
 the liqui moly air conditioner cleaner 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.630
 in the case of which it is unfortunately in the case 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.270
 from 90 the problem that the head of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 nozzle the spray head is a little too thick 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 that means he can not be in you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.270
 to introduce the opening but there are also 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.679
 other means such as this one 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.250
 Foam cleaner then correct 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.229
 Beautifully spreads another head 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.489
 owning another hose to her 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.869
 but of course many other dose 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.409
 So I can do that in 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.970
 In this case, that I have this head now 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.750
 put on the line 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.000
 and then drive into the opening 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 Here you see the opening where now the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.780
 Temperature sensor was inside and you 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.370
 looks nice on the back here 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.989
 right side the structure of the climate 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.209
 damn what where all the bacteria 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.459
 sit inside the stink produce 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.859
 with the hose so with the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.720
 SprÃ¼hkopf father now in there and spray 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.549
 as large as possible so that you 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.220
 as much as possible caught by the evaporator 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.600
 the middle of it that's the best 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.730
 father with the hose a little bit clean 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.389
 and get up and down that they are 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.650
 as large as possible the whole thing caught 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.010
 so now that I act the medium 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.900
 leaves 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.880
 depending on the product, this can be about one 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.980
 Half an hour you can be on each 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.209
 if you do not already have that 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.579
 Changing the interior filter are 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.200
 have pollen filters in the case now 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.340
 here an activated carbon filter and off 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.079
 I can say of my own experience 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.209
 because that often asked what the difference 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.370
 between normal and activated carbon the it 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.340
 may be sold the incorporated coal 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.290
 Particles yes that now slight odors in 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 the air already through the filter 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.910
 that means you are filtered out 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.099
 just drive a bit in total 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.599
 pleasant to the 90 to 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.010
 interior filter would have to change 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.819
 First, the cover of the company 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.150
 to midnight - the screws once 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.510
 here and on the other side too 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.510
 remove 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.690
 now you can take off the carrier here 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.230
 and the interior filter from the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.160
 take out holder and change here 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.160
 to solve the clips 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:49.090
 you can exempt that and you can see 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.590
 here how beautiful how dirty that is 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.950
 So what has accumulated there 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.950
 and as compared 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.430
 the fresh looks so when inserting 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.859
 the interior coat of the cde the noses 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:17.040
 the cones first hang in the 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.040
 stables and then put in the filter 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.560
 clip that in here again 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.860
 put the carrier back on now 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.540
 moved again and you are in front 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.920
 finished so after that 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.330
 disinfectant could act 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.640
 of course, built everything together again 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.650
 that is the temperature sensor back in 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.450
 insert the opening and insert the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.850
 cover under the glove box again 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.920
 Install with the two gate pushed and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.420
 then you have the the vaporizer 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.930
 to dry again that means you do that 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.210
 same as in the beginning creates the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.610
 Ventilation on circulated air at annual temperature 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.910
 and the biggest blower the strongest 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.890
 fan stage yes of course there are 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.870
 other methods like you the whole 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.240
 you could do the disinfection 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.890
 for example, the well-known method 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.540
 with these little cans you in 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.150
 Put the footwell and then put it through 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.080
 the air is sucked 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.880
 I have to admit now I am now 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.530
 not the biggest fan of it 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.200
 sole use of these cans 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.850
 therefore with direct spraying of 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.890
 Evaporator of course better results 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.330
 but can achieve just 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.980
 for demonstration or for 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.890
 addition of the measure I show 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.030
 you as you do with the cans and 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.920
 Although the crucial point is at 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.990
 These cans that you have around 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.850
 Air intake finds your vehicle and 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.800
 It's not like the many 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.040
 instructions always on the passenger side 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.130
 but for example at 46 on the driver's side 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.540
 to test that 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.270
 So to find out, take your time 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.240
 best a single location of one 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.730
 handkerchief or similar and could 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.820
 then in the footwell see where the 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.220
 intake is at 90 o'clock 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.230
 this really is the passenger seat 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.750
 below and I'll show you now how to 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.490
 that can recognize us so what your animal 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.330
 Here where the air is sucked when I 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.259
 closer now 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.050
 go with the strip you see that 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:17.719
 this one stands in implementing 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:19.219
 vents are said so before 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.449
 he activates the speak if you start 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.280
 of course the engine because you're ten 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.710
 to circulate the whole thing for minutes 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.509
 lets switch to recirculation and to the 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.000
 windshield ventilation and goes to the 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.740
 strongest blower level after her 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.330
 of course you have the whole activated 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.379
 windows and doors and leave the whole 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.379
 to go through 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.330
 So after the dose has gone through 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.400
 it's best to open all the windows and 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.160
 doors so the whole ventilated because 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.990
 the quite correct sharply after the convincing 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.250
 smells and dries according to the climate 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.130
 Evaporation with the same procedure 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.319
 as in the beginning it is called air 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.630
 temperature and the strongest 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.250
 stage then should actually be ready 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.660
 and the casual smell of the 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.789
 Air conditioning disappeared 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.560
 as you could see is that ever 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.090
 after vehicle type of course no big 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.810
 witchcraft and you can do it yourself 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.430
 realize 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.470
 Of course you have to be at the 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.610
 take care of the air conditioning 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.199
 that one does not herd the bacteria 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.229
 somehow additionally burdened so 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.940
 that means ten minutes before the end 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.460
 the drive you should the air conditioning 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.440
 turn it off so that the climate 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.539
 vaporizer a little tons of load because 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.000
 otherwise in the humid environment of course 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.620
 The bacteria will grow much more if 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.479
 So you liked this video and
