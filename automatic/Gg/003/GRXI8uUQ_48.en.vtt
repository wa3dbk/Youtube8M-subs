floor what I'm pulling now is going to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.470 
floor what I'm pulling now is going to
be<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> autofill<00:00:11.340> which<00:00:11.790> drops<00:00:12.120> every

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
be the autofill which drops every

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.360 
be the autofill which drops every
morning<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.440> instance<00:00:13.740> where<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.980> early<00:00:14.190> more

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
morning for instance where it early more

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.089 
morning for instance where it early more
in<00:00:14.460> store<00:00:14.840> so<00:00:15.840> our<00:00:15.990> process<00:00:16.230> starts<00:00:16.560> at<00:00:16.890> 4:00

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
in store so our process starts at 4:00

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.329 
in store so our process starts at 4:00
a.m.<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.960> based<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> cells<00:00:20.099> from

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:20.339 
a.m. so based on the cells from

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.130 
a.m. so based on the cells from
yesterday<00:00:20.819> it's<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.869> trigger<00:00:22.019> your

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
yesterday it's going to trigger your

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.909 
yesterday it's going to trigger your
batches<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.919> pull<00:00:23.310> whatever<00:00:23.759> we<00:00:23.909> sold<00:00:24.919> the

batches to pull whatever we sold the

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.279 
batches to pull whatever we sold the
autofill<00:00:26.309> is<00:00:26.429> generally<00:00:26.849> about<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.479> 40%

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
autofill is generally about a 40%

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.319 
autofill is generally about a 40%
trigger<00:00:29.989> so<00:00:30.989> you'd<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.409> to<00:00:31.769> sell<00:00:31.979> 40%<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.030> an

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329

manual<00:01:03.780> calves<00:01:04.129> which<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.549> store<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.060> for

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
manual calves which at my store like for

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.560 
manual calves which at my store like for
the<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.899> closers<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.590> manual<00:01:07.979> calves

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the the closers to do manual calves

which<00:01:09.570> triggers<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.110> 30%<00:01:10.590> trigger<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> then

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
which triggers at 30% trigger so then

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
which triggers at 30% trigger so then
that<00:01:13.259> way<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.530> could<00:01:13.710> fill<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> floor<00:01:14.329> more<00:01:17.000> so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that way we could fill the floor more so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.569 
that way we could fill the floor more so

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
number and then beat 31 so for instance

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.910 
number and then beat 31 so for instance
this<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:09.490> B<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.810> you're<00:03:11.930> gonna<00:03:12.020> go<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.200> be<00:03:12.410> 31

this is a B so you're gonna go to be 31

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.400 
this is a B so you're gonna go to be 31
and<00:03:13.670> you're<00:03:13.790> gonna<00:03:13.880> scan<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.360> location<00:03:14.720> and

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
in the Waco and it's gonna double beep

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.710 
in the Waco and it's gonna double beep
whenever<00:03:20.990> it<00:03:21.110> wants<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.470> pull<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:22.660> okay<00:03:23.660> so

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
obviously there's only one type of item

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.600 
obviously there's only one type of item
in<00:03:25.820> there<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.020> gonna<00:03:27.110> say<00:03:27.410> however<00:03:28.310> many

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
in there and it's gonna say however many

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.370 
in there and it's gonna say however many
you<00:03:28.730> need<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> pull<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.300> sis<00:03:29.480> pull<00:03:29.690> five<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.320> I

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
you need to pull so sis pull five so I

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.430 
you need to pull so sis pull five so I
type<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.740> five<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.540> that's<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:33.020> for<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.290> meat

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
type in five and that's it for the meat

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.760 
type in five and that's it for the meat
so<00:03:33.910> that's<00:03:34.910> pretty<00:03:35.270> small<00:03:35.480> batch<00:03:35.720> another<00:03:36.650> one

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
so that's pretty small batch another one

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.510 
so that's pretty small batch another one
and<00:03:37.480> when<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.540> put<00:03:38.750> meat<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:40.070> got<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.280> keep<00:03:40.370> in

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
and when you put meat you got to keep in

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.130 
and when you put meat you got to keep in
mind<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.880> got<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.120> keep<00:03:41.240> raw<00:03:41.450> food<00:03:41.690> separated

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
mind you got to keep raw food separated

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.860 
mind you got to keep raw food separated
so<00:03:42.560> obviously<00:03:43.010> poultry<00:03:43.550> goes<00:03:43.910> at<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.120> barb<00:03:44.330> as

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
so obviously poultry goes at the barb as

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.840 
so obviously poultry goes at the barb as
it<00:03:45.020> cooks<00:03:45.200> at<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> higher<00:03:45.650> temperature<00:03:45.950> which

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
it cooks at a higher temperature which

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.840 
it cooks at a higher temperature which
is<00:03:46.940> 165<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:48.260> have<00:03:48.350> your<00:03:48.470> ground<00:03:48.680> beef<00:03:48.890> which

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
is 165 you have your ground beef which

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.900 
is 165 you have your ground beef which
cooks<00:03:50.120> at<00:03:50.330> less<00:03:50.930> than<00:03:50.960> horse<00:03:51.560> about<00:03:51.770> 145<00:03:52.430> and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
cooks at less than horse about 145 and

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.480 
cooks at less than horse about 145 and
then<00:03:53.630> your<00:03:53.780> steak<00:03:53.990> which<00:03:54.170> good<00:03:54.350> set<00:03:54.530> about<00:03:54.740> 135

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
then your steak which good set about 135

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.180 
then your steak which good set about 135
depending<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.240> how<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.770> then

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
top

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.670 
top
for<00:04:02.569> food<00:04:02.750> safety<00:04:02.930> reasons<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:06.410> now<00:04:06.560> I'm

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
for food safety reasons and so now I'm

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.930 
for food safety reasons and so now I'm
going<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:06.950> look<00:04:07.100> for<00:04:07.400> meat<00:04:07.910> cooler<00:04:08.590> which<00:04:09.590> is

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
going to look for meat cooler which is

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.500 
going to look for meat cooler which is
raw<00:04:10.940> meat<00:04:11.290> not<00:04:12.290> ready<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.650> cook<00:04:12.800> meat<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:14.360> it's

raw meat not ready to cook meat so it's

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.870 
raw meat not ready to cook meat so it's
gonna<00:04:14.630> say<00:04:14.870> go<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.200> zero<00:04:15.530> for<00:04:15.860> which<00:04:16.400> obviously

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
gonna say go to zero for which obviously

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.360 
gonna say go to zero for which obviously
the<00:04:16.970> raw<00:04:17.120> meat<00:04:17.269> gets<00:04:17.510> stored<00:04:18.139> over<00:04:18.440> here<00:04:18.709> there

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the raw meat gets stored over here there

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.710 
the raw meat gets stored over here there
is<00:04:19.400> no<00:04:19.639> weight<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:19.940> for<00:04:20.150> our<00:04:20.269> meat<00:04:20.419> because

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
is no weight this for our meat because

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.159 
is no weight this for our meat because
you'll<00:04:20.900> want<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.109> avoid<00:04:21.320> cross-contamination

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
you'll want to avoid cross-contamination

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.720 
you'll want to avoid cross-contamination
so<00:04:24.169> you<00:04:24.260> go<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.410> eat<00:04:24.620> ochio<00:04:25.070> fork<00:04:25.400> which<00:04:25.580> is

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
so you go to eat ochio fork which is

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.520 
so you go to eat ochio fork which is
over<00:04:25.940> here<00:04:27.850> scan<00:04:28.850> each<00:04:29.120> bar<00:04:30.080> code<00:04:30.320> right<00:04:30.500> here

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
over here scan each bar code right here

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.280 
over here scan each bar code right here
and<00:04:31.210> then<00:04:32.210> I'll<00:04:32.330> scan<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:32.780> one<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:33.850> one

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
and then I'll scan that one and that one

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.730 
and then I'll scan that one and that one
so<00:04:36.290> then<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.590> says<00:04:36.770> pull<00:04:37.070> four<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.240> want<00:04:41.510> to
