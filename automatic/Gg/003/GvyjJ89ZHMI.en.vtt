00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
primarily because there are a ton of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
primarily because there are a ton of
attachments<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.710> a

long<00:01:14.040> barrel<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:15.299> does<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:15.990> range<00:01:16.290> but

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
long barrel which does more range but

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.530 
long barrel which does more range but
you<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> aim<00:01:18.270> down<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you know you don't have to aim down the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
you know you don't have to aim down the
sights<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.049> hit<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.439> close<00:01:19.799> range<00:01:20.130> they're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
sights you hit them close range they're

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.179

dead<00:01:20.750> no<00:01:21.750> buts<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.070> can

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
dead no buts about it and then you can

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.249 
dead no buts about it and then you can
increase<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.670> range<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> nice<00:01:25.049> little

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
