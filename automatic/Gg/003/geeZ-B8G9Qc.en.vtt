00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.750
 dear spectators of woodwork tv beautiful 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.520
 that they are back again 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.920
 they have just seen it i have 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
 arbitrarily picking up some other lines 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.820
 this piece of corpse brought around today 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.510
 about traveling with them about the subject 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 to speak 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.630
 You do that in a classic way 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 takes an impression pencil 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.369
 Draw the line you bless 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 or would like to strain around then a beautiful 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.360
 to be able to make the connection 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 may be sinking that can be slit 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.200
 and be connected and that works 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 with a falling pencil already 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.730
 wonderful i want them today though 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.829
 show how it can be even better 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.980
 because a pencil really has 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.010
 disadvantages on the one hand that he roughly 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.960
 previous wooden like ash or oak 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.250
 I can leave the particles behind 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.840
 do not grind properly later 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.300
 get away and second he helps me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.290
 not in the orientation of a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 tooling i'll show you that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.130
 I mean if I have one of these here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.229
 wanted to take these lines and wanted 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.000
 along for example, vote at one 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.130
 tine connection then it works 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.659
 maybe good and I can now 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.890
 but you can fix it here the next time 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.909
 to be very good at the next 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 It can be very good that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.759
 I easily twisted or that one 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.380
 a bit off the line and in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.759
 a series of such moods as 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.610
 you have them with tines you go that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.049
 see you sooner or later and there is one 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 irregular and not so nice 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.820
 impression if they become one instead 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.680
 the knife already looks at the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.720
 thing quite different from such 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 incentive knife I have filed here once 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 and presented for her 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 I'll start on the right side 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.530
 we have a very wide rice 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 knives from the usa 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.130
 that's good for bigger work 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.899
 suitable is 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.549
 besides that, we have a very simple one 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.740
 Scalpel is available in every craft shop 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.020
 has a replaceable blade 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.159
 wonderful then a small one 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.740
 homemade a turned piece 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 equipped with a rest from a sting 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.730
 Saw blade which is very good, by the way 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 So a wonderful material about sheep 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.870
 sound and here we have 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 a very nice piece that is one 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.739
 Japanese incentive knife has the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.780
 huge advantage that it is only one-sided 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.510
 is sanded and accordingly good 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.340
 It can be very good here now at one 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.739
 ruler or here in this case at one 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.010
 angle concerns we use this now 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.810
 times instead of a pencil mark namely 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.030
 now this sunrise knife and drive 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.410
 This way only once 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.989
 and they may already have heard it 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.209
 this knife cuts through the top one 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.220
 layer of fibers downright and that 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.430
 is exactly the big advantage of incentive 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.230
 knives the uppermost fiber is clean 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.599
 cut that means here I already have 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.730
 a good quality and i have 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:02.609
 exactly one line and that comes to me now 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.930
 I can handle it very well 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.480
 now here my chisel 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.489
 put in and the doc is really in 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 this cut in so we included this 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.970
 cut better at the camera 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.829
 I still add a board 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.109
 then this is the shadow throw 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.120
 a little clearer so I can 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.959
 now come with my chisel and 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.720
 just me in this straight 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.569
 place a joint 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.380
 and now I can vote and so on 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.049
 and then I can do a wonderful job 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.569
 and I literally break into this fugue 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.950
 this also exactly in the escape of the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:46.109
 first vote can vote and 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:51.090
 so on and a few centimeters further 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:54.470
 it goes on the same way and so they can 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.180
 make connections with torn 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.129
 a lot of help lines 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.739
 Become more accurate than just with the help of one 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.169
 pencil when sawing works that 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.700
 By the way, just as well 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.980
 That's why I want to bring you the technology 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.699
 to work on rice knives very ans 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.560
 heart 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.079
 I wish them much success there and 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.379
 say to woodworks until next time 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.379
