00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Burnie: I always get really nervous based on who the guests are for this show.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.200
And you two make me especially nervous.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.900
This is Chris and Aaron, you guys know them from Social Disorder.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.240
Chris, I trust you more than I trust him, why don't you start us off?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.920
Chris: Alright, so a million dollars...

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.440
Burnie: A million dollars.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.000
Chris: You give birth, once a month, to a miniature version of yourself.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Burnie: Ok.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Chris: And it's like this little bitty baby of you.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.260
And then it goes through it's full life cycle in 2 days...

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.760
...and then it dies.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Aaron: In 10 hours or something he'd be old enough to drink.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Chris: Yeah.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.000
Aaron: And so you'd take him to the bar after mmm, half a day?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420
Give this guy a drink, he's dying in a day and a half.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.900
Chris: (Laughter) He's not going to last long.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.400
Burnie: Get him a drop of whiskey.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.100
Aaron: How long does this last for? Does it last...

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Chris: For the rest of your life.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
Aaron: The rest of your life?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.600
Chris: Yeah.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000
Burnie: In 4 years you'd have 48 of these. (Laughter)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Aaron: I know. (Laughter)

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Burnie: You would get a system going though, cause you know it's like January...

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.140
Aaron: Right.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.560
Burnie: ...and the one comes out and you're like "Ok, we only have 2 days. I need you to dig 12 holes."

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.700
All: (Laughter)

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
Burnie: That had...that had to work in a (unintelligible)

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.400
Aaron: Can you drop it off at like, the adoption center and like, not say anything and then they're like aww

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.520
and then they bring it in and they're like "What the Hell is going on?"

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.280
Burnie: (Laughter) I love the way you think adoption works now, like a, like a Charles Dickens novel.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.780
Aaron: You just drop it off on the doorstep.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.780
Burnie: (Laughter)

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.200
Aaron: Please take care of my gentle little Burnie.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.540
Burnie: It's like, "Well, we don't know if we can find a place for this kid."

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.460
It's like just wait a couple of days and see what happens.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.960
All: (Laughter)

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.900
Aaron: I think it's going to work out.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.480
Burnie: Gotta go, ok.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.800
Is it sad when they die?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.300
Chris: Well...

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.780
Burnie: Is it like dramatic? You're like (sad sound).

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.680
Chris: For them it certainly is.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140
Burnie: Do I have to make like a little bed? Like...

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.480
Chris: A little death bed.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.880
Aaron: They have little oxygen masks. You have to like, "Remember me." It's like yeah...

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.320
Burnie: Yeah, I'll remember you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.820
All: (Laughter)

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.280
Burnie: I'll remember you number 28.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.580
Aaron: Outside the window are 48, it's just...

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.180
Burnie: You taking that?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.200
Aaron: I can't, I can't take it. I can't, it's too much work. That's way too much work, the graves, the birthing, the potential drop off at the adoption.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.860
I'm out.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.460
Burnie: I'm taking it.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.940
All: (Laughter)

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.420
Burnie: And then you can turn the million into a lot more. Just like, with a little show with these guys.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.860
Yeah, I'm taking the money, sure.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.500
You get a million dollars, ok? But, for the rest of your life, whenever you see a kitchen sponge

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.920
you eat it. Immediately.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.080
Like you have an overwhelming compulsion to eat a sponge when you see it.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.500
Chris: Are they...tasty?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.400
Burnie: No, it tastes just like a sponge. Chris: It tastes like a sponge? Ok.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.380
Aaron: You can't grab the sugar and be like I just need a little...

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.500
do make the sponge go down.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.120
Chris: I like ketchup.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.520
Burnie: If you think that will help, sure. You might be like in the hallway at an office building,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.720
there's a sponge sitting on the side of a janitor's cart, there's not going to be any sugar around. (Laughter)

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.660
Aaron: Just covered in filthy mop water, just, just soaking and the juices coming down. Just...

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.540
I don't think I could, I live a pretty sponge heavy life.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.320
Chris: Like we were talking about putting stuff on it,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.340
like you could make a hamburger sponge.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.060
Like you, you get a bun, you get some lettuce, tomato, you put a sponge on it, and you just eat it and you're not even going to notice.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.200
Yeah, I would do that.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.940
Aaron: You'd do that? (Laughter)

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.420
Chris: I eat anything, eh.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.180
Burnie: Alright Aaron, first time on the show, what do you got?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.320
Aaron: Uhh, it's a pretty mild one.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.360
You get a million dollars, but, once a month for a year you have to go out on a nice date with

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.860
Hitler.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.300
All: (Laughter)

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.740
Burnie: Let me be perfectly clear.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.240
Aaron: Alright.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.460
Burnie: And I would say this to Hitler.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.040
Aaron: Right.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.260
Burnie: I would say, "Look, if we're going to do this, I'm making all the plans."

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.360
Aaron: "Like, why don't we go to Paris?"

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.500
Burnie: No, we're not. No.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.040
"We could go...camping."

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.000
All: (Laughter)

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.680
Burnie: It'd be like, no, I'm not going camping with Hitler.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.120
Aaron: But it would be great because after like 6 dates he'd be like

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.700
"Don't you trust me?"

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.660
And you give him that one date to try out and then it's just like the restaurant is burning,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.740
you know like, "What, I did this for you."

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.320
Chris: It's another thing too, where it's like, after like, the 3rd date he's like

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.340
"Well, it's you know, we've been dating a long time."

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.680
Aaron: You're talking about going steady?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.920
Chris: No it's like, you know, he wants to take it to the next level.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.460
Aaron: You're watching a movie with him

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.580
and he just kind of puts his hand on your knee and you're like "Uhhh."

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.620
Burnie: What is the next level with Hitler for you, what is that?

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.160
Chris: No, i'm just saying, does he have expectations?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.760
Burnie: Wha-, like what? That you're going to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.060
bang him or that you're going to invade Poland with him?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.940
Which one, what are you talking about?

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.140
Chris: I don't know, it depends, I don't know, I- I- I-, it depends on what he wanted.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.820
Burnie: What happens to Hitler, at the end of the year?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.320
Aaron: He dies.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.080
Burnie: He dies?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.640
Aaron: But he dies of, of heartbreak.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.500
Burnie: It's like the last 5 minutes of The Notebook.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.540
All: (Laughter)

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.080
Burnie: Be with Hitler.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.900
Aaron: He was just like, "I have...always...was...there...for you."

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.740
Burnie: Urgh, that would be the worst.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.480
It's like you had to hold Hitler's hand in bed lovingly.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.080
And the media is there and everything and you'd be the guy that was like "I spent a, my year with Hitler."

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.680
Chris: You could write a book though.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.180
Aaron: Mein date.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.120
All: (Laughter)

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.060
Chris: Mein date, yeah.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.240
Burnie: I'm gonna say no, I'm going to, I wouldn't do it.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.500
I wouldn't want to give Hitler the joy of my company.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.880
Chris: I don't want to hang out with Hitler, he's such a dick.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.160
Aaron: Nah, I wouldn't do it either.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.860
Burnie: Alright. Nobody's taking a million dollars to date Hitler?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.540
Hitler is the Achilles Heel, good to know.
