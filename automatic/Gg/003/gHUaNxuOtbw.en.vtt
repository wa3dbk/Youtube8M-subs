00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
now for the harmony part of that a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.470 
now for the harmony part of that a
single<00:01:44.620> string<00:01:44.830> run<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:46.090> little<00:01:46.210> lead

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
single string run that little lead

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.530 
single string run that little lead
growing<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.880> going<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.060> stir<00:01:49.210> them<00:01:49.330> up<00:01:49.390> in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
growing you're going to stir them up in

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.980 
growing you're going to stir them up in
a<00:01:49.630> fourth<00:01:50.530> string<00:01:50.830> third<00:01:51.250> fret<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:52.930> to

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
a fourth string third fret it's going to

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.770 
a fourth string third fret it's going to
be<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.140> same<00:01:53.320> pattern<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.360> way<00:01:55.510> up<00:01:55.660> you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
be the same pattern all the way up you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.480 
be the same pattern all the way up you
know<00:01:55.870> rhythm<00:01:56.200> wise<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.130> it's<00:01:57.250> going<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.430> go

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
know rhythm wise so it's going to go

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
know rhythm wise so it's going to go
third<00:01:57.820> up<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.180> fifth

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.699 

now<00:02:58.510> for<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.780> second<00:02:59.109> break<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.409> I'm<00:02:59.469> going

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
now for the second break that I'm going

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.880 
now for the second break that I'm going
into<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> atre<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.489> me<00:03:00.640> pretty<00:03:01.450> similar<00:03:01.890> gonna

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
into the atre to me pretty similar gonna

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.839 
into the atre to me pretty similar gonna
start<00:03:03.129> off<00:03:03.219> with<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.400> same<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.730> know

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
start off with the same you know

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.839 
start off with the same you know
chunking<00:03:04.269> pattern<00:03:04.689> on<00:03:04.870> everything<00:03:05.849> any

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
chunking pattern on everything any

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.610 
chunking pattern on everything any
differences<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:08.049> there's<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.439> to<00:03:08.500> be<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
differences is there's going to be a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.550 
differences is there's going to be a
little<00:03:08.859> tag<00:03:09.069> at<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.310> end<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:10.439> single<00:03:11.439> dead

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
little tag at the end of a single dead

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.610 
little tag at the end of a single dead
harmony<00:03:11.980> run<00:03:12.189> so<00:03:12.689> let<00:03:13.689> me<00:03:13.750> show<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.959> that
