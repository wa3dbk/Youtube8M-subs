 hello good to all kids as you know 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.550
 Gta 5 came online and good in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 There were quite a few problems with the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.500
 servers and that and almost nobody could play 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.849
 yesterday but hey I was playing for a while 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.470
 and he's pretty handsome 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.180
 right now he usually uploads a video of how 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
 It's my apartment and a couple of little things 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 what can be done and later 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.269
 start to climb live more handsome and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 playing with friends and that when 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.679
 let's know more or less how everything will go 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 that and good I'll show you my apartment that 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.700
 is this vale 125 thousand turkeys this floor of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.600
 that there are many to choose from I think it is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.160
 of the cheapest will be 8 out of 80,000 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.200
 87,000 out there and well I'm going to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.820
 teach has a six-seater garage 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.410
 he's pretty handsome 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.310
 Let's see 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.310
 in the royal 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.420
 to see this is the entrance really is 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.420
 pretty good to be worth 125 thousand 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.509
 payments had to be fine here I have the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.570
 bed here the closet and then here is 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.590
 the shower and here you can shower if 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.680
 you want and take off your sweat or blood 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.600
 is what I said a while scrum 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.549
 As you can see, it's being sung, I do not know if that 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.640
 would have some kind of skill or 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.799
 something like that and well I will pass this already 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 good to see if it reaches the maximum 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.200
 well there are many different things that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.840
 there is in the online mode that there is not in it 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.049
 story mode like for example buy 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.759
 apartments and all this now I'm going to 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.979
 teach another couple of things that the player 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.340
 can do anywhere in a 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.799
 small menu that I have here was kept 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.689
 clicked the select button here you can see 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.399
 if you want to invite people to 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.270
 fast gps apartment to an ATM to the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.890
 Uncle uncle in car workshop whatever 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.549
 a logo the inventory here you can give 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.190
 money of the last blow for example 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.900
 you hit one and the other hit you 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.030
 helped you choose the pasta that you 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.819
 you give right now because I do not have anything the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.709
 money over and good as you can see I can 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.450
 Remove the cap or if I want to put my 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 I have to look, I put on my headphones 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.030
 for example I already want this not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.439
 after the shielding you can also 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.910
 choose if you want to carry it 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.910
 put or not 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.270
 you can smoke cigarettes you can eat 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.840
 candies 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.150
 or drink that cocacola to raise the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.730
 life and all that and it's pretty good 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.310
 this you can do anywhere and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.200
 good also if you keep pressing the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 button to make them action for more 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.430
 time and upload more videos will depend if 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.170
 you notice now when you smoke is going 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.900
 lowering the life of health what is 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 quite interesting smoking kills yes that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.570
 We have not got much and well 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.630
 the rest of the floor now to see I think that 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.790
 not everything else that will teach me and good 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.790
 Here you can choose the action you want 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.310
 do when you are walking you can 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.650
 change when you want here also the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.000
 face 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.960
 as I say it's pretty good and pretty 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.490
 full is playing with friends is 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.320
 pretty much more entertaining than the 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.360
 gta 4 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.150
 well here for choosing to kill me too 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.580
 that is going to see 500 thousand 500 dollars if 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.830
 do you have 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.170
 access to vehicle and this good as there 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.040
 I know completely that it's good I'll see the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.489
 rest of the apartment now 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.670
 here you can see a glass of whiskey or 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.590
 a few got drunk when 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.739
 be with your colleagues or whatever 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.620
 after giving a hard blow then 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.170
 come here relax a little 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.770
 there I think that beer also gives me the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.020
 I can drink I do not know 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.210
 has generated to come back again they see it 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.760
 drunk not to say 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.760
 You can also choose the radio, I think 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 the study trying the other day 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.120
 have left whiskey for a while we are going to 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.120
 show them the little 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.930
 ok with this I'm going to go a little bit 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.930
 drunk I think 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.130
 and the radio I think you could change 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.720
 as I said to see if you want to move 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.569
 seriously one moves badly before 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.899
 go drunk 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.899
 ok you can listen to the radio you can 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:46.969
 change station and all that is 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:50.029
 pretty good because he was not there either 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.919
 the story mode and good to see if the 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:55.639
 drunk is that you want to move now 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.459
 bad but I do not know if there was something else I think 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.469
 that not apart from TV and on TV 

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:03.800
 there are some channels that are pretty 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:06.619
 interesting also how I was good 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.569
 good saying when I pulled the series it 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:11.539
 you know talking about gta 5 before 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.209
 come out then if you are on your floor 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.889
 from the TV you can see people at the 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.319
 who are being pursued by the police or 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.729
 who is stealing anything 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.809
 well you can see what the 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.789
 people can not also see the cameras 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.149
 of security now I'm going to put the camera 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.430
 of the main door is quite 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:35.240
 fun and that's because I still do not 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.339
 I control this much of meeting people 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.979
 to the apartment and that because my friends 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:43.960
 they still do not have a house as you can see there is the 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:49.000
 garage then I'll show you 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.470
 and good as you can see here I can see what 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.470
 they are doing the rest I can also 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.340
 put this filter as if they were the 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.229
 news is pretty handsome all this and 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.580
 good as I told you gta online has 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.020
 A lot of things 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.879
 what 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.180
 of which we still do not know anything so 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:09.460
 you can already see things coming up and well ya 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.159
 I will upload more interesting games and 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.270
 your story to teach you the 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.770
 apartment that I have and everything that is 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.889
 can do 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.449
 and kids, I think I've already taught you 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.449
 I'm going to the garage now 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.820
 well I have come to die for a cigar 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.770
 seriously 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.550
 once it was super made dust and 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.770
 I thought I had the drinking action to 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.750
 I could come directly to the garage but 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:43.340
 is to teach is the difficult but outside 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.960
 Let's see 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.480
 as you see there are always a lot of people 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.660
 some games although you can also 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.810
 choose if there are not many people 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.580
 to the same thing but you can also choose if 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.210
 you want to play with people or not so not 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.220
 there is a problem 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.509
 well you can extend the map to century 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.950
 because it 's pretty good for 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:07.070
 long chases and that 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.130
 and well here you have it, I think I have 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.820
 a motorbike a bike the normal car that 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.400
 I have from the beginning 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:18.580
 it's pretty good and pretty big 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.110
 this garage there I have a laptop with the 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.660
 that could connect annette mind and equal 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.850
 that with the mobile but good 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.550
 here you have the bike that is hanging from 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:31.560

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.560
