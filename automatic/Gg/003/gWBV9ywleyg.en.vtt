00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
line as opposed to just doing a harsh

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.909 
line as opposed to just doing a harsh
line<00:05:06.220> right<00:05:06.820> there<00:05:07.030> on<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.240> lower<00:05:07.419> lash<00:05:07.690> line

line right there on the lower lash line
but<00:05:08.919> still<00:05:09.340> kind<00:05:09.640> of<00:05:09.760> bringing<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:10.240> some<00:05:10.510> depth

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
but still kind of bringing in some depth

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.960 
but still kind of bringing in some depth
by<00:05:11.110> using<00:05:11.140> a<00:05:11.620> deep<00:05:11.860> rich<00:05:12.160> black<00:05:12.580> right<00:05:12.940> there
