00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 the exposure of real ones 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.080
 exhibition from cc oo p 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.400
 there same interview that took place in the 19th century 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.859
 i 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.610
 I arrived as 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.580
 how we lived as the driving axis 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.310
 7 physically 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.370
 percent s is the realistic movement that occurred the decease before but 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.770
 completely in art by the way there was its epicenter in the French club 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.880
 i with figures like curbelo 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.730
 carol durán 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.889
 i was present 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.120
 in cataluña 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.880
 p 1 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.510
 some consequences really the seer as it connects that with the movements 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.550
 with the munch museum the museum always wants to make exhibitions that 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.350
 they issue 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 or that they put some aspects of relevance into account, said that it is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.810
 different about 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.649
 per cent exceeded its own collections to the collection of Catalan magazines 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:28.470
 what we have 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.390
 in the museum is very important in itinere therefore 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.210
 is 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.370
 undoubtedly it is an exhibition 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.680
 want to deepen 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 this milestone start again cd 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.380
 of new visions new looks on a part of this the collections I've 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.030
 been new readings that's what I really think that energize the museums 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.700
 and that make the public 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.000
 percent 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 can in bearn go back to the museum to see 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 nor how the permanent collections are contextualizing that exhibition 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.520
 I believe that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.650
 has a morbid interest because 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800
 In someway 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 and this one 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.529
 to a tour 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.059
 im 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:15.109
 Intimate interesting from the point of view of the stock of art history 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.099
 from the point of view of the studies or the figure of merkel but on how 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.769
 percent reverberates more than the movies now we made gomez like 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.639
 as in the event that it fails as they impacted shaft in these off 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.120
 Catalan activists who also told that he promised martí alsina had gone to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.509
 Paris 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:37.410
 the French pedalismo that had that hole really 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.960
 n very important n the news percent but 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.030
 in the exhibition does not end in that connection between the Quindianos realism 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.470
 French 19 and citi and percent realists and made Catalans but that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.890
 if in a look they told me 'unrealistic' say originate towards the p 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.719
 towards the Spanish golden century 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.549
 doubly 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.210
 as with figures like 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.469
 of the actress pere ribera 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.199
 oo pujol 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:12.319
 murillo after entering a very important work of the mythical world of 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.489
 nation to the dance london 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.340
 i 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.789
 just 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 the cut what we could 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.439
 the last 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.829
 min 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.699
 the last realistic 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.699
 the last realistic 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.329
 what is antoni tápies 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.210
 and that undoubtedly 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.239
 ee 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.529
 establishes 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.719
 a point and end in a 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.199
 a in a 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.549
 a new vision of tuna 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.439
 but undoubtedly not exempt was performed
