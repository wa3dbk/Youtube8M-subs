00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 while two others are the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.920
 hairstyles for long hair and for 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
 my natural hair is much more 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.710
 attached to my extension to the cries of the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
 habits usable in clear and a long 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.119
 French to create an effect of villains 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.119
 spontaneous 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.640
 I will start the first hairstyle 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.140
 with a little African braid and so 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.210
 I take three small locks of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.340
 hair and I start placing the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.800
 exterio stuff for heaven of the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.170
 wick of the middle and then I add a 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.290
 little loose hair on each side at 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.690
 the middle wick I cross I add 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 I cross and I added but in fact 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.500
 this step is optional and you 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.090
 could selected all the hair 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.880
 that they are above your 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.250
 Frank and go straight to the stage 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.350
 following and if I stop added 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.420
 loose hair from left side and I 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.820
 change my right side strategy too 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.280
 and so I bring back the right lock to 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.860
 middle I picked a new line 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.570
 lock of hair is jelly added to the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.940
 middle wick but here I want to train 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.160
 a little loop and then I bring back the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.140
 left wick in the middle and still a 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.479
 once I bring the right lock to 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.820
 middle selecting a new file 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.890
 hair strand I add it to the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.560
 magic of the middle of ways to form a 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.030
 loop and so on until you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.630
 arrive at the desired length from 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.000
 your stress 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 this hairstyle is ideal for 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 mid-length hair 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 Oh 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 I 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.980
 I have to go point from your 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.540
 braids with a little elastic then 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.490
 decide how you want the task and 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.140
 you could set your 13 to 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.120
 the back of your head with a few 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.980
 flat strips or can be create a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.770
 very symmetrical on the other side of your 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.030
 head is hs and braids together to 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.950
 the back of your head 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.950
 that's what I'm going to do today 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.930
 these are the results 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.210
 for the second time I'm going 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.670
 select a lock of hair and 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.930
 creates a normal three-arm braid if 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.120
 you have time you can try 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.100
 this hairstyle with a braid despite 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.020
 sores like that the results will 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.580
 to be even prettier but today 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.710
 I will show you the version with 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.960
 two normal braids and so I braid 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.940
 wiggle hair and then I attach 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.850
 the hair that stays in a tail of 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.230
 horse 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.740
 I will separate them into two parts 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.630
 equal 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.760
 I brought back his locks behind 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.030
 mistress at the fasteners with a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.030
 elastic 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.410
 then I promise I need them 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.040
 bring back behind my ponytail 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.870
 I also attach them now 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.170
 I will repeat these operations until 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.170
 tips 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.930
 and as usual to give shape 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.580
 desired to your hair you can 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.890
 delicately pulled on the sides of 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.890
 your braids that's what I'm doing here 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:34.430
 and here is my 13 separate for the 3rd 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.740
 hairstyle i'm going to put my hair all 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.030
 a high ponytail to give some 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.110
 volume and extra length 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.210
 in mashhad 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.190
 I reached my extensions a clip 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.419
 according to the technique that I already have 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.699
 shown in one of my videos 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.270
 previous ones and so I invite you to the 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.949
 discover 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.419
 I start by separating my cock from 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.250
 horse in two equal parts 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.979
 then i know by charles ii that's 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.259
 party we give again and I have 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.910
 created a twisted braid young roll 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.520
 each bit on it even so the same 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.020
 sense towards my face at the same time I 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.199
 twists is a shame in the sense 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.199
 opposite 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.850
 I attach the tips with a small 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.860
 elastic I do the same thing with the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.990
 second set of hair to get 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.420
 2 13 twisted and now if you go 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.820
 take these 2 13 and if you go them 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.070
 twists and towards your face you go 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.230
 to get a twisted truce agra de bras 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.400
 the result is very interesting and very 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.840
 unique 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.860
 this hairstyle is perfect for those 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.480
 with very thick hair and very slow 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.350
 in addition you can turn this 13 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.970
 in a bun 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.520
 you just have to roll this press 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.680
 around his base is attached the whole thing 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.360

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.880
 I will show you in a little bun 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.400

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.140

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.560

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.780

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.490
 of its length then I take the 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.200

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.940
 lausanne rolls around my bun 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.070

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.570
 the dots as of my second braids I 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.000
 hide the tip on the buns 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.560
