00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
smartphone here almost phablet like why

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.460 
smartphone here almost phablet like why
is<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.789> affordable<00:00:24.359> well<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:25.019> is

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is it affordable well because is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.080 
is it affordable well because is
resolution<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.880> wide<00:00:27.480> VGA<00:00:28.019> 480<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:29.160> 800<00:00:29.429> pixels

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
resolution is wide VGA 480 by 800 pixels

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.530 
resolution is wide VGA 480 by 800 pixels
so<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> imagine<00:00:31.730> with<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> 5<00:00:33.300> inch

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so as you can imagine with the 5 inch

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.680 
so as you can imagine with the 5 inch
size<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> display<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.550> pixel<00:00:35.940> density<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
size of the display the pixel density is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
size of the display the pixel density is
not<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.500> high<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.040> definitely<00:00:38.610> shows

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
not really high and it definitely shows

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
not really high and it definitely shows
it's<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.629> terrible<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.430> definitely

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it's not terrible but it's definitely

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.979 
it's not terrible but it's definitely
not<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.719> those<00:00:43.170> HD<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.809> Full<00:00:45.809> HD

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
not up there with those HD and Full HD

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
not up there with those HD and Full HD
displays<00:00:47.210> today<00:00:48.770> in<00:00:49.770> addition<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
displays today in addition it has a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
displays today in addition it has a
dual-core<00:00:50.930> processor<00:00:51.930> clocked<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.469> 1.2

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.939 
dual-core processor clocked at 1.2
gigahertz<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> fastest<00:00:55.350> device

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
gigahertz so it's not the fastest device

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.520 
gigahertz so it's not the fastest device
out<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.699> well<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.570> also<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.609> only<00:00:59.609> only

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
out there as well it also has only only

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.160 
out there as well it also has only only
512<00:01:01.530> megabytes<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.309> RAM<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.989> see

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
512 megabytes of RAM as you can see

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
512 megabytes of RAM as you can see
there<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.580> some<00:01:05.580> slight<00:01:06.270> lag<00:01:06.630> visible<00:01:07.140> here

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
there is some slight lag visible here

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.340 
there is some slight lag visible here
and<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:09.090> course<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.659> could<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.110> due<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and there of course this could be due to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
and there of course this could be due to
the<00:01:10.740> fact<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> pre-production

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the fact that this is a pre-production

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.810 
the fact that this is a pre-production
model<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.229> still<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> final<00:01:14.220> unit<00:01:14.400> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
model it's still not the final unit but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
model it's still not the final unit but
we<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:16.189> have<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> sense<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> Alcatel

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
we do have a sense that the Alcatel

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.060 
we do have a sense that the Alcatel
OneTouch<00:01:20.909> scribe<00:01:21.479> easy<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.619> among

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
OneTouch scribe easy will not be among

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.789 
OneTouch scribe easy will not be among

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
course it is on the bigger side it's not

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.560 
course it is on the bigger side it's not

extremely thick though not

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.610 
extremely thick though not
so<00:01:46.490> thin<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.860> we<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.120> like<00:01:51.120> this

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
so thin and we actually like this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.720 
so thin and we actually like this
interesting<00:01:52.620> frame<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.400> display

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
interesting frame around the display

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.990 
interesting frame around the display
here<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:56.010> not<00:01:56.250> flush<00:01:56.580> with<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
here because it it's not flush with the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
front it kind of stands out and makes

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.020 
front it kind of stands out and makes

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
holding the device feel a very different
