duo processor laptop actually a really

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.910 
duo processor laptop actually a really
nice<00:00:33.030> laptop<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.930> reinforce<00:00:34.500> everything

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
nice laptop they reinforce everything

nice laptop they reinforce everything
nice<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.489> hardened<00:00:35.850> aluminum<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:37.170> problem

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
nice with hardened aluminum the problem

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.170 
nice with hardened aluminum the problem
is<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.910> also<00:00:39.090> has<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> video<00:00:39.840> issue<00:00:40.200> where<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
is it also has a video issue where the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.060 
is it also has a video issue where the
actual<00:00:42.180> chip<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> BGA<00:00:43.200> chip<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.860> comes

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
actual chip it's a BGA chip and it comes

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.819 
actual chip it's a BGA chip and it comes
off<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.670> board<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.539> heat<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
off the board with heat so this is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
off the board with heat so this is
another<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.579> contender<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
another one that's a contender for that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.350 
another one that's a contender for that
reflow<00:00:49.350> technique<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.550> actually<00:00:50.910> fixing

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
reflow technique we're actually fixing

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
reflow technique we're actually fixing
these<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> shop<00:00:52.260> also<00:00:52.640> under<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
these here at the shop also under that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.010 
these here at the shop also under that
flat<00:00:54.120> break<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.539> 125<00:00:55.289> flat<00:00:55.590> rate<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.870> wish<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
flat break the 125 flat rate I wish I

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
flat break the 125 flat rate I wish I
could<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.260> shown<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> process<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
could have shown you the process but I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520 
could have shown you the process but I
was<00:00:59.760> kind<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> tinkerer<00:01:00.449> tinkering<00:01:01.410> around

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
was kind of tinkerer tinkering around

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.680 
was kind of tinkerer tinkering around
all<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> working

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
all this and got it working

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.289 
all this and got it working
we<00:01:04.379> also<00:01:04.530> comprehend<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.060> put

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
we also comprehend this one we put

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.200 
we also comprehend this one we put
upgraded<00:01:07.290> thermal<00:01:07.680> compound<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.939> works

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
upgraded thermal compound and that works

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.399 
upgraded thermal compound and that works
great

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
great

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
great
nice<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.310> laptop<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.570> bit

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
nice little laptop and with a little bit

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
nice little laptop and with a little bit
of<00:01:12.770> care<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.130> bring<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> back<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> life

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
of care you can bring it back to life

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.359 
of care you can bring it back to life
again<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:16.350> something<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.250> at

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
again that's something we do here at

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.210 
again that's something we do here at
reboot<00:01:17.759> IT<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.110> next<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:19.860> get

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
reboot IT and the next one that I do get

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
reboot IT and the next one that I do get
in<00:01:20.400> I'll<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:21.150> ahead<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> I'll<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.720> through<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
in I'll go ahead and I'll go through the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
in I'll go ahead and I'll go through the
the<00:01:22.890> fix<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.520> guys<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:24.360> goes

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the fix so you guys can see what goes

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
the fix so you guys can see what goes
into<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.680> almost<00:01:26.009> exactly<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
into that but almost exactly like that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.560 
into that but almost exactly like that
DV<00:01:27.330> 9000<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.520> video<00:01:29.520> chip<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.360> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
DV 9000 the video chip on that you just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
DV 9000 the video chip on that you just
got<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> heat<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.229> instead<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> doing<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
got to heat it up instead of doing the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.819 
got to heat it up instead of doing the
torch<00:01:32.820> fix<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.630> an<00:01:33.750> infrared<00:01:34.140> machine<00:01:34.619> now

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
torch fix I have an infrared machine now

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
torch fix I have an infrared machine now
and<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.100> every<00:01:35.520> flow<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.960> chip

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and I every flow it with that the chip

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
and I every flow it with that the chip
is<00:01:37.350> too<00:01:37.530> far<00:01:37.860> gone<00:01:38.100> I'll<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:39.060> pull<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
is too far gone I'll actually pull the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.010 
is too far gone I'll actually pull the
chip<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.140> reball<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.299> put<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> new<00:01:42.390> chip<00:01:42.810> on

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
chip off reball it and put a new chip on

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
chip off reball it and put a new chip on
there<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.710> definitely<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.729> long-term

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
there and that's definitely a long-term

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.710 
there and that's definitely a long-term
fix

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
