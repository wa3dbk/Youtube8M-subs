00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.769
 good evening good morning or good afternoon 12 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.659
 highlight the increase in unemployment 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:13.579
 percent on the other hand because we can not achieve what we 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.919
 we want 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.789
 and many times it's because we focus on what we should focus on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970
 there is a theory 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.259
 who run these capitalist system 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.669
 what we all pursue 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.410
 we are so focused 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.970
 They should have 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.440
 we 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.360
 i work a lot 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.290
 We believe that we must work very hard 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 i the char 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 because the meeting 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.520
 generate 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.190
 more money to be able to have more things not 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.670
 and I say that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.880
 welfare in that order we do 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.490
 in order to have 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.160
 believing that he had more things is going to make us better people quito is in this 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.470
 neighborhood do 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.630
 in order to have 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 for do 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.240
 as if I were a girl 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 that's why Chávez has been opposed so much we work sometimes 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.799
 12 hours a day 14 hours a day 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.929
 thinking that if we have a better house if we have the best car if our 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.850
 children has the best school 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.550
 if we can have more things we will be better people 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.760
 urged to return to Venezuela capitalist system 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.439
 we are always chasing a dream 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.650
 monetary 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 the way that we propose 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.870
 that is the right thing 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.230
 it would be little different instead of 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
 to have believing that they can do 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.130
 we propose something little different we believe that first you have to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.240
 be 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.740
 and then do 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.240
 Ascer peace 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.070
 and whoever wants to be a consequence 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.139
 what happens here 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.889
 if we fight kind of do more to have more we will always be 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.439
 in this 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.540
 in this wheel is not that I imagine it wants to be approved without hauling in 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.570
 where are you doing part is doing to have lists 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.729
 it's like a cancer 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:28.249
 that their baby girl is destroyed and that the canaleja very very very very strong 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.249
 channel performance in a room in the same place 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.779
 has ever felt like the cause of his magazine that for more than 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.099
 he approaches and he likes you if you fight and work 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.159
 never again the exit from the same place 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.159
 Spain also studies what to do to have 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.279
 what's going on 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.450
 when you place 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.929
 focus on doing to have 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.889
 the Castellón team 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.319
 in growth as a person entered growth 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.159
 spiritually or emotionally growing 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:02.829
 growth of 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.959
 the abilities of their abilities and jobs in being 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.939
 if it is better to be human 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:10.889
 if you want 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.249
 greater knowledge 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.809
 of what you should do if you have more financial knowledge than that is something 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.219
 that they have not taught us at school 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.259
 they have not taught us 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
 many mathematics of taking square roots 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.399
 but then really we do not get stein pointed out to have a knowledge 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.069
 financial 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.299
 then why can not we have more money because we do not know how 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.819
 because we do not need it 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.629
 it was like human beings 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.620
 then when you focus on being the best person 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.469
 Internet 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.829
 more knowledge in growing all 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.769
 grow as a human being 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.099
 you will know what you have to do 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.089
 and if you know what you have to do 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.280
 this level 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.309
 it's going to be a consequence 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:07.549
 but the important thing is to grow as a human being grows in this one starts 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.549
 the rest is the consequence of 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.530
 James word on if you have more knowledge and adequate knowledge 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.159
 for what you want then 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.250
 the consequences derived 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.050
 I did not have anyone 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.059
 that's 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.469
 the above based on these pages 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.809
 we will be talking more on another occasion
