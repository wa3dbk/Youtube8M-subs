00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.979
 again to the X 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.590
 again to the X is not going to jump to 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.079
 the gta screen we give start 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.890

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.580
 what to do before the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.950
 first cloud do it pretty fast 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.210
 the first one will come out but equal to 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 the third or the fourth is a trick 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.310
 pretty hard to do good then 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.750
 after giving the circle when in 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.510
 where the credit card will take us 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.520
 to the campaign 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.830
 and we will give when we are 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.230
 I have loaded the character completely 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.399
 We give the start playstation store xx 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.700
 now alert in the alert we give to the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.489
 X 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 we are giving all the time to the X 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.470
 when we are in on the card 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.480
 credit 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.670
 we give to the circle 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.349
 then it will not jump again to the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.030
 campaign but as if we were in the 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.750
 multiplayer that is we can do the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 which of the multiplayer in the campaign and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.620
 I believe that if the first thing before 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.379
 You could have done the trick has called 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.730
 arrived if you could see yourself more but 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.680
 good can be done in the middle of the trick 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.390
 also good and we see that it is taking 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.819
 yesterday there's going I'm calling arrivals 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.600
 And I'll give you ask me activity 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.600
 will send an activity 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.209
 well now the only thing we're going to have 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.100
 what to do is get some stars 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.110
 234 keep in mind that the more 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.050
 stars have more points of 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.660
 experiences are going to give since each each 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.130
 that is what you do in this trick in this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.650
 part of the police 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.850
 you can only do the trick 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 trick only you can do it when 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.620
 are the stars flashing me here 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.190
 I in this train in this video I do 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.410
 wrong 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.760
 I explain now I do it too 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.050
 when they are when I was not surrounding 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.550
 you have to do it only when the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.810
 star is blinking 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.970
 because if they are not going to give us the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.520
 experience are basically going to take us away 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.720
 the money of the bank and help oslo in the 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.800
 plan at hand but they will give us the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.510
 experience that I just level up 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.910
 with the mission of gerald you give him xx or 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.840
 is to accept the mission accept it from lester 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.400
 that gives you that you pay 500 dollars for 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.750
 because it freed you from the police and from rada 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 x 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.800
 if it turns you back again what it is 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.240
 what happens sometimes that if you do not 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.720
 with gerald's mission mission 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.630
 that you just ended up sending gerad 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.100
 it's going to come out that you're downloading the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.800
 mission and you will not be able to do it 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.630
 trick 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.850
 that's why I always recommend doing it with 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.080
 him with gerald's mission well 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.630
 here would be the trick if you want to what 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.190
 re-explain for those who do not 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.660
 you have understood 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.660
 come on we are on the internet 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.330
 on the internet we give the start 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.610
 we go to playstation store to playstation 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.600
 store in the playstation store 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.180
 we give it xx or the step would be this 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.080
 internet start we go to the right 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.240
 of all xx is going to jump to the menu of 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:34.590
 people are going to jump into the gta we give 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:38.450
 start right x 'star right x up 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.130
 xx and you would have done it then it would be 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.770
 the credit card circles will carry 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.230
 the campaign then in the campaign 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.570
 dais start playstation store or jump to 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.020
 through a credit card and you give 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.020
 back to the X 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.020
