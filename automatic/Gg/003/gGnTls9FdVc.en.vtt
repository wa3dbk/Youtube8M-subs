00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
then obviously messy at the top there as

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.099 
then obviously messy at the top there as
well<00:03:17.790> but<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.359> just<00:03:18.569> take<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.750> look<00:03:18.900> at<00:03:19.019> this

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
well but if you just take a look at this

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.759 
well but if you just take a look at this
defense<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.799> statin<00:03:20.340> defense<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:21.769> crazy
