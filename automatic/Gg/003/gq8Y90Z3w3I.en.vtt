00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
on one side and then move around of the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.190 
on one side and then move around of the
other<00:01:16.430> because<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:16.909> darker<00:01:17.600> when<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.840> first

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
other because it's darker when you first

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.550 
other because it's darker when you first
start<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.860> that<00:01:19.270> way<00:01:20.270> if<00:01:20.689> I<00:01:20.930> always<00:01:21.290> start<00:01:21.500> on

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
start and that way if I always start on

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.289 
start and that way if I always start on
the<00:01:21.650> left<00:01:21.799> side<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.430> side<00:01:22.640> will<00:01:22.790> be<00:01:22.820> darker

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
the left side that side will be darker

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.910 
the left side that side will be darker
and<00:01:23.450> kind<00:01:23.689> of<00:01:23.750> give<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:23.960> illusion<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.619> the

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
and kind of give the illusion that the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.249 
and kind of give the illusion that the
light<00:01:25.369> from<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.210> pumpkins<00:01:26.689> is<00:01:26.810> coming<00:01:27.140> from

light from the pumpkins is coming from

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.420 
light from the pumpkins is coming from
the<00:01:27.350> right<00:01:27.590> side<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:29.390> I'm<00:01:29.600> gonna<00:01:30.250> do<00:01:31.250> this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
the right side so now I'm gonna do this

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.149 
the right side so now I'm gonna do this
little<00:01:31.670> guy<00:01:32.829> and<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:35.360> with<00:01:35.689> all<00:01:36.619> water

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
little guy and as with all water

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.270 
little guy and as with all water
coloring<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:38.240> know<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:39.259> just<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.740> looks

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
coloring you know it just it looks

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.429 
coloring you know it just it looks
better<00:01:40.549> if<00:01:40.850> it's<00:01:41.030> not<00:01:41.439> exactly<00:01:42.439> perfect<00:01:44.439> so

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
better if it's not exactly perfect so

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.469 
better if it's not exactly perfect so
don't<00:01:45.710> stress<00:01:46.130> out<00:01:46.310> about<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.240> is

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
don't stress out about it and it is

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.539 
don't stress out about it and it is
something<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.380> do<00:01:48.920> get<00:01:49.100> better<00:01:49.250> with

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
something that you do get better with

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.609 
something that you do get better with
practice<00:01:50.710> here<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.860> goes<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:53.360> think<00:01:53.960> we'll

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
practice here it goes and I think we'll

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.899 
practice here it goes and I think we'll
take<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.670> little<00:01:56.060> of<00:01:58.899> this<00:02:00.460> let's<00:02:01.460> try<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.759> little

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
take a little of this let's try a little

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:11.210 
take a little of this let's try a little
really<00:02:02.420> rust<00:02:02.719> on<00:02:02.990> one<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.259> these<00:02:03.320> guys
