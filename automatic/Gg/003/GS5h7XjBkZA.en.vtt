again the ability for section to throw
on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.680> run<00:03:14.710> is<00:03:15.400> what<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.180> think<00:03:16.330> separates

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
on the run is what I think separates

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.490 
on the run is what I think separates
them<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:17.950> plus<00:03:18.510> takes<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.690> hammerhead

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
them it's a plus takes to hammerhead

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.190 
them it's a plus takes to hammerhead
it<00:03:20.890> shows<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.460> Twinkletoes<00:03:22.060> for<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> endzone
