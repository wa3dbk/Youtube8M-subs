would<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.360> very<00:01:42.540> difficult<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> very

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
would be very difficult and very

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
would be very difficult and very
different<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.799> me<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.820> way<00:01:45.420> easier

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
different for me but it was way easier

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
different for me but it was way easier
than<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> thought<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.770> when<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> came

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
than what I thought because when I came

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
than what I thought because when I came
down<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.850> thought<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> would

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
down I actually thought that I would

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770 
down I actually thought that I would
have<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> survive<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.970> ready-to-eat<00:01:50.970> food<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have to survive on ready-to-eat food and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
have to survive on ready-to-eat food and
I'm<00:01:51.899> gonna<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.470> meal<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> day<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.070> lots

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'm gonna have one meal a day and lots

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
I'm gonna have one meal a day and lots
of<00:01:53.700> things<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.290> everything

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
of things like that but then everything

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
of things like that but then everything
just<00:01:55.860> looked<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.460> easy<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.939> probably

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
just looked so easy it's probably

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.569 
just looked so easy it's probably
because<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.049> flatmates<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.310> always

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
because my flatmates and I always

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.740 
because my flatmates and I always
thought<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.180> probably<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
thought you know you are probably and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.240 
thought you know you are probably and
