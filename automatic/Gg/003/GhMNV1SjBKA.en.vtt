00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and opes are those my keyboard and I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.310 
and opes are those my keyboard and I
always<00:00:51.090> felt<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.510> dark<00:00:51.809> cords<00:00:52.140> better

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
always felt like dark cords better

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
always felt like dark cords better
option<00:00:52.620> yeah<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> trap<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.000> does<00:00:54.270> have

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
option yeah it's a trap so it does have

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.790 
option yeah it's a trap so it does have
its<00:00:54.539> advantages<00:00:54.660> over<00:00:55.079> smells<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> thing

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
its advantages over smells but the thing

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.670 
its advantages over smells but the thing
is<00:00:55.829> spell<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.520> don't<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.780> banish<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
is spell I don't know to banish it it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.020 
is spell I don't know to banish it it's
it's<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.160> better<00:00:59.399> effect<00:00:59.850> and<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> think

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it's the lot better effect and I think

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
it's the lot better effect and I think
it's<00:01:00.239> underrated<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.320> even

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's underrated and I think it's even

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
it's underrated and I think it's even
like<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.680> nice<00:01:01.859> little<00:01:01.980> tech<00:01:02.250> card<00:01:02.489> expecially

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
for some decks I do understand that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.969 
for some decks I do understand that
targets<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.000> its<00:01:06.090> flaws<00:01:06.320> but<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> deck

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
between like a breakthrough skill and a

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.949 
between like a breakthrough skill and a
fiendish<00:03:33.550> chain<00:03:33.580> but<00:03:33.910> it's<00:03:34.060> good<00:03:34.300> because<00:03:34.690> I'm

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
fiendish chain but it's good because I'm

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.440 
fiendish chain but it's good because I'm
not<00:03:34.990> saying<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.410> replaces<00:03:35.740> veiler<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.240> mean

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
not saying it replaces veiler but I mean

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.760 
not saying it replaces veiler but I mean
ok<00:03:37.720> here<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.050> was<00:03:38.140> read<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.290> effect<00:03:38.560> when<00:03:38.740> I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
ok here it was read the effect when I

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.110 
ok here it was read the effect when I
faced<00:03:38.950> up<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.190> tag<00:03:39.370> position<00:03:39.760> monster<00:03:40.030> your

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
effect except during the damage step it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.580 
effect except during the damage step it
gate<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.480> effect<00:03:43.810> if<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.020> do<00:03:44.170> change<00:03:44.410> that

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
gate the effect if you do change that

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.590 
gate the effect if you do change that
monster<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.950> face-up<00:03:45.190> defense<00:03:45.640> position<00:03:46.090> this

monster to face-up defense position this

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.300 
monster to face-up defense position this
is<00:03:46.780> good<00:03:46.959> because<00:03:47.080> how<00:03:47.380> many<00:03:47.440> P<00:03:47.680> how<00:03:47.950> many<00:03:48.130> deck

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
is good because how many P how many deck

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.760 
is good because how many P how many deck
people<00:03:48.640> do<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.790> know<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.090> play<00:03:49.240> a<00:03:49.270> deck<00:03:49.770> was

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
people do you know that play a deck was

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.710 
people do you know that play a deck was
i<00:03:50.890> threatening<00:03:51.190> effect<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.790> usually<00:03:52.450> this

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
i threatening effect and usually this

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.480 
i threatening effect and usually this
card<00:03:53.080> would<00:03:53.200> probably<00:03:53.440> apply<00:03:53.560> two<00:03:53.680> synchros

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
card would probably apply two synchros

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.790 
card would probably apply two synchros
or<00:03:54.640> an<00:03:54.700> XYZ<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.420> only<00:03:56.080> special<00:03:56.500> summon<00:03:56.709> at

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
or an XYZ is the only special summon at

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.290 
or an XYZ is the only special summon at
face-up<00:03:57.100> in<00:03:57.490> Attack<00:03:57.760> Position

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
face-up in Attack Position

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.060 
face-up in Attack Position
so<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> went<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.990> Gaeta<00:03:59.170> input<00:03:59.560> defense<00:03:59.920> so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
so it went to Gaeta input defense so

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.320 
so it went to Gaeta input defense so
they<00:04:00.100> can't<00:04:00.370> do<00:04:00.459> any<00:04:00.580> damage<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.000> turn<00:04:01.150> and

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
they can't do any damage that turn and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.210 
they can't do any damage that turn and
you<00:04:01.390> can<00:04:01.510> deal<00:04:01.660> with<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.900> next<00:04:02.170> turn<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.709> if<00:04:03.130> it

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
you can deal with it next turn and if it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.860 
you can deal with it next turn and if it
was<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> black<00:04:03.730> rose<00:04:04.090> unless<00:04:04.690> they

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
was like a black rose unless they

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.030 
was like a black rose unless they
special<00:04:05.170> someone<00:04:05.320> at<00:04:05.440> defense<00:04:05.739> you<00:04:06.010> can

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
special someone at defense you can

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.860 
special someone at defense you can
negate<00:04:06.520> its<00:04:06.730> effect<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.239> then<00:04:07.630> put<00:04:07.780> in

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
negate its effect and then put in

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.360 
negate its effect and then put in
defense<00:04:08.080> position<00:04:08.530> take<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:08.830> out<00:04:08.950> next<00:04:09.130> turn

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
defense position take it out next turn

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.520 
defense position take it out next turn
it's<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.090> good<00:04:10.270> card<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:10.840> people<00:04:11.350> would

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
it's a it's a good card and people would

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.780 
it's a it's a good card and people would
probably<00:04:11.709> say<00:04:11.920> well<00:04:12.370> what's<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.640> difference

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
probably say well what's the difference

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.949 
probably say well what's the difference
between<00:04:13.060> break<00:04:13.420> their<00:04:13.600> schoo<00:04:13.780> yeah

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
between break their schoo yeah

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.120 
between break their schoo yeah
breakthrough<00:04:14.350> skill<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.620> can<00:04:14.739> use<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:14.980> twice

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
breakthrough skill you can use it twice

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.789 
breakthrough skill you can use it twice
that<00:04:15.520> is<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.670> pro<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.390> but<00:04:17.350> i<00:04:17.530> think<00:04:17.710> people

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
but I think people got wind of it cuz

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.330 
but I think people got wind of it cuz
when<00:04:29.260> they<00:04:29.350> got<00:04:29.470> their<00:04:29.710> ultra<00:04:30.070> they're<00:04:30.190> like

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
when they got their ultra they're like

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.400
