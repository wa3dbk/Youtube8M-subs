lady<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.820> smile<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.390> us<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
lady a smile for us so you see the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
lady a smile for us so you see the
sinking<00:00:38.280> five<00:00:38.520> photos<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.020> going

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
sinking five photos and then it's going

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
sinking five photos and then it's going
to<00:00:40.200> analyze<00:00:40.500> now<00:00:40.829> she<00:00:40.890> wasn't<00:00:41.370> smiling<00:00:41.640> she

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to analyze now she wasn't smiling she

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.960 
to analyze now she wasn't smiling she
wasn't<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.840> looking<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.260> us

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970

she<00:00:45.970> doesn't<00:00:46.210> look<00:00:46.270> interested<00:00:46.870> at<00:00:46.990> all<00:00:47.080> but

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
she doesn't look interested at all but

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.860 
she doesn't look interested at all but
the<00:00:48.190> idea<00:00:48.460> was<00:00:48.520> it<00:00:49.000> would<00:00:49.120> have<00:00:49.210> analyzed<00:00:49.660> the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
the idea was it would have analyzed the

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.110 
the idea was it would have analyzed the
face<00:00:50.080> look<00:00:50.470> for<00:00:50.680> blinks<00:00:51.070> if<00:00:51.370> we<00:00:51.550> got<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.760> smile

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
face look for blinks if we got a smile

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.850 
face look for blinks if we got a smile
would<00:00:52.360> have<00:00:52.450> moved<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.810> smile<00:00:53.110> on<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.740> the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
would have moved the smile on to the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.740 
would have moved the smile on to the
image<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.850> instead<00:00:55.090> of<00:00:55.150> taking<00:00:55.480> multiple

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
image so instead of taking multiple

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.410 
image so instead of taking multiple
images<00:00:56.170> multiple<00:00:57.070> images<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.700> choosing<00:00:58.300> the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
images multiple images and choosing the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.110 
images multiple images and choosing the
right<00:00:58.630> one<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.500> actually<00:00:59.740> takes<00:01:00.400> multiple

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
right one it actually takes multiple

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.570 
right one it actually takes multiple
images<00:01:01.750> does<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.680> intelligence<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.340> see

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
images does the intelligence to see

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.340
