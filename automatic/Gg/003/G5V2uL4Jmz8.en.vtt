00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
for the character that we know from

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.570 
for the character that we know from
rebels<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.570> um<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.379> actually<00:00:16.710> thought<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
rebels so um I actually thought that the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
rebels so um I actually thought that the
cliffhanger<00:00:18.210> at<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.720> beginning<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
cliffhanger at the beginning of this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.250 
cliffhanger at the beginning of this
comic<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.250> kind<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.580> expected<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.270> comic

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
comic was kind of expected this comic

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410 
comic was kind of expected this comic
con<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> felt<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.100> little<00:00:23.220> bit<00:00:23.400> redundant<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.090> felt

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
con I felt a little bit redundant I felt

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.599 
con I felt a little bit redundant I felt
the<00:00:25.019> aspects<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> story<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> like

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the aspects of the story of like

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
the aspects of the story of like
basically<00:00:27.619> caleb<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.740> evolving<00:00:29.220> into<00:00:29.460> Canaan

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
basically caleb is evolving into Canaan

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
basically caleb is evolving into Canaan
because<00:00:30.630> now<00:00:30.840> he<00:00:30.900> has<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> strip<00:00:31.349> away<00:00:31.470> his<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because now he has to strip away his you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310 
because now he has to strip away his you
know<00:00:32.040> his<00:00:32.160> Jedi<00:00:33.120> ways<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> think<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:34.020> kind

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
know his Jedi ways and I think we kind

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020 
know his Jedi ways and I think we kind
of<00:00:34.380> already<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
of already got that in some of the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
of already got that in some of the
previous<00:00:36.180> comics<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.380> has<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
previous comics we get that he has to

change that he has to be no longer a
Jedi<00:00:40.440> he<00:00:40.500> has<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
Jedi he has to be like this kind of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
has to fend for himself I think we got

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
has to fend for himself I think we got
that<00:00:45.329> already<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.899> thought<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.230> were<00:00:46.320> going

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that already and I thought we were going

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
that already and I thought we were going
to<00:00:46.710> move<00:00:46.950> forward<00:00:47.309> at<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> point<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.660> thought

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to move forward at this point I thought

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
to move forward at this point I thought
we<00:00:48.870> were<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.440> more<00:00:49.649> story<00:00:50.489> lines

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
we were to get some more story lines

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
we were to get some more story lines
which<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> sense<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> are

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
which kind of in a sense that we are

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
which kind of in a sense that we are
getting<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.480> feel<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:54.989> as

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
getting but I don't feel like it was as

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
getting but I don't feel like it was as
um<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:56.910> happening<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.300> fast<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.650 
um I think it's happening as fast as I
would<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.850> being<00:01:00.090> said<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
even the writing itself is is really

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.789 
even the writing itself is is really
good<00:01:38.040> there's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> perfect<00:01:38.820> marriage<00:01:39.090> between

is it something that he should be doing

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
is it something that he should be doing
because<00:02:22.530> she<00:02:22.799> told<00:02:22.950> him<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.400> run<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:23.909> all<00:02:24.299> that

but I think that was an interesting

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.059 
but I think that was an interesting
question<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:26.579> him<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.299> bring<00:02:27.510> up<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:28.069> for

kind of peaked I would say it's kind of

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.469 
kind of peaked I would say it's kind of
stagnant<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:02.159> as<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.699> slight<00:04:03.060> against<00:04:03.359> the

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
stagnant not as a slight against the

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.149 
stagnant not as a slight against the

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
comic but there hasn't though there

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.520 
comic but there hasn't though there
wasn't<00:04:05.310> anything<00:04:05.609> in<00:04:05.819> here<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.060> really

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
wasn't anything in here that really

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.559
