00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
 Hello everyone, today we create 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.360
 colored garlands made with solids 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 paper geometries 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.830
 for this project you need 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.759
 colored cards a ruler one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.730
 pencil an eraser of the scissors and the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.559
 now we draw our usual 6 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.559
 cards we start from the pyramid 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.230
 then france we made the pyramid 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.420
 now what do you say if we make a cube 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.660
 formed by six squares like the one of the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.830
 photo frame you remember from the draw 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.830
 come on ok 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.369
 now that we have designed the sales of 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.369
 the Italian 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.020
 now we glue the fouls we have 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.689
 made on marta 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.620
 to paste them frank we must first a 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.960
 bending where the lines are is true 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.020
 fold them following the pencil marks 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.659
 towards the inland 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 once you have folded them put 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.600
 glue for paper on the bed and then 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.600
 close them 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.600
 ok let's squeeze a little bit where they are 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.159
 he read them so that they were crushed 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.159
 well against the card 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.770
 franci but we were great and fights 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.469
 how many solids we have created now 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.159
 we slip into the wreath we help each other 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.159
 with a needle 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.710
 no 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.750
 where we appeal the wreath now that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.750
 ended up here in the diving chair 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.480
 ok it's really good on the real chair 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.810
 so every morning when we come to do 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.250
 breakfast we remember the solids from 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 greet our friends 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.980
