00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
sleep with hypnosis and that works out

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.739 
sleep with hypnosis and that works out
in<00:01:40.889> my<00:01:40.950> favor<00:01:41.100> perfectly<00:01:41.729> even<00:01:42.539> though<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
in my favor perfectly even though that

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.139 
in my favor perfectly even though that
was<00:01:42.840> sort<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> risky<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.859> just<00:01:44.149> would

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
was sort of risky because I just would

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.080 
was sort of risky because I just would
might<00:01:45.359> have<00:01:45.509> missed<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:47.369> worked<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.030> my

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
might have missed it worked out in my

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.889 
might have missed it worked out in my
favor<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> end<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.929> um<00:01:50.090> I'm<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.299> encore

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.669 
him into the Giga Drain now that he's
sleeping<00:01:53.969> so<00:01:54.479> I'll<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.780> able<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.959> switch<00:01:55.469> into

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
sleeping so I'll be able to switch into

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.999 
sleeping so I'll be able to switch into
my<00:01:55.950> tornadus<00:01:56.429> easier<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.409> able<00:01:58.499> to<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.829> a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840 
kill something off with the hurricane
without<00:02:01.109> any<00:02:01.229> issues<00:02:01.499> so<00:02:01.740> he<00:02:02.249> could<00:02:02.459> switch<00:02:02.700> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
without any issues so he could switch in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.489 
without any issues so he could switch in
his<00:02:02.999> moment<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.569> obviously<00:02:03.899> doesn't<00:02:04.259> want<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.109 
his moment but obviously doesn't want to
run<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> risk<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:05.159> hurricane<00:02:05.639> hitting<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
run the risk of hurricane hitting and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.899 
run the risk of hurricane hitting and
losing<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.079> weather<00:02:07.229> war<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.099> instead<00:02:08.789> he

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
losing the weather war so instead he

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.309 
losing the weather war so instead he
goes<00:02:09.090> into<00:02:09.239> his<00:02:09.330> ferrothorn<00:02:09.780> basically

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
goes into his ferrothorn basically

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.960 
goes into his ferrothorn basically
stacks<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.769> and<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.159> enjoy<00:02:11.400> specs<00:02:11.760> this

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
stacks it and because enjoy specs this

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.410 
stacks it and because enjoy specs this
will<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.269> solid<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> KO

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
will be a solid to a KO

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.140 
will be a solid to a KO
in<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.599> fair<00:02:13.750> thorne<00:02:13.990> which<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.260> great<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
in the fair thorne which is great and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.220 
in the fair thorne which is great and
next<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.990> believe<00:02:17.410> he<00:02:17.739> does<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.550> into<00:02:18.900> his<00:02:19.900> a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
next I believe he does go into his a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.020 
next I believe he does go into his a
boma<00:02:20.560> snow<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.340> order<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.849> hale
