below<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.640> expectation<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:03.080> a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
below so the expectation is that as a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.320 
below so the expectation is that as a
group<00:03:03.440> they<00:03:03.680> will<00:03:04.010> work<00:03:04.190> as<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.460> consultant<00:03:04.700> in

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
a consultancy fashion the information

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.300 
a consultancy fashion the information
they<00:03:07.940> get<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.300> very<00:03:08.600> brief<00:03:08.960> ABC<00:03:09.740> packaging

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
they get is very brief ABC packaging

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.430 
they get is very brief ABC packaging
produces<00:03:10.910> packing<00:03:11.270> materials<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.080> then

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
produces packing materials and then

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.200 
produces packing materials and then
assault<00:03:12.830> through<00:03:13.130> retail<00:03:13.550> outlets<00:03:14.030> and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
basically then it goes on to say that

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.430 
basically then it goes on to say that
they're<00:03:16.100> undergoing<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.790> change<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:18.260> this

plan<00:03:52.520> they<00:03:52.850> make<00:03:53.090> regular<00:03:53.540> meetings<00:03:53.930> with<00:03:54.050> me

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
plan they make regular meetings with me

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.530 
plan they make regular meetings with me
appointments<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.340> 20<00:03:55.640> minutes<00:03:55.820> work<00:03:56.240> it<00:03:56.420> as<00:03:56.510> a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
appointments of 20 minutes work it as a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.750 
appointments of 20 minutes work it as a
formal<00:03:57.020> meeting<00:03:57.050> between<00:03:57.740> consultants<00:03:58.460> and

manager and they will ask me questions

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.680 
manager and they will ask me questions
and<00:04:01.130> basically<00:04:01.520> i'll<00:04:01.760> make<00:04:01.940> up<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.300> answers

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
and basically i'll make up the answers

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.330 
and basically i'll make up the answers
so<00:04:02.900> they're<00:04:03.230> consistent<00:04:03.830> with<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> theme

analysis of the of that particular

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.620 
analysis of the of that particular
solution<00:04:18.170> they<00:04:18.829> then<00:04:19.070> having<00:04:19.700> come<00:04:19.970> up<00:04:20.120> with<00:04:20.390> a

solution they then having come up with a

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.530 
solution they then having come up with a
set<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.310> principles<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:23.060> set<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.270> options

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.170 
set of principles and a set of options
they<00:04:24.440> then<00:04:24.680> determine<00:04:25.460> their<00:04:25.790> set<00:04:26.060> of

they then determine their set of

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.880 
they then determine their set of
recommendations<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:27.230> again<00:04:27.410> this<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.710> all

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:05.259 
that they talked about in terms of

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.399 
that they talked about in terms of
implementation<00:07:05.680> were<00:07:06.490> much<00:07:06.729> more<00:07:06.969> about

implementation were much more about

implementation were much more about
organizational<00:07:08.409> infrastructure<00:07:08.710> the

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
in that it would be very difficult for

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.629 
in that it would be very difficult for

for<00:07:22.870> wiki's<00:07:23.199> and<00:07:23.409> they<00:07:24.069> would<00:07:24.250> implement

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
for wiki's and they would implement

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.240 
for wiki's and they would implement

the problems of group dynamics you still

have to keep on top of them and in this
