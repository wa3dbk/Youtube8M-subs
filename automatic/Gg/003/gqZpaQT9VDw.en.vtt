want to say that once you got the base

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.120 
want to say that once you got the base
of<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:16.910> item<00:00:17.270> elevator<00:00:17.539> setup<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.590> items<00:00:18.949> can

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
of the item elevator setup the items can

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.249 
of the item elevator setup the items can
also<00:00:19.280> move<00:00:19.699> through<00:00:20.180> solid<00:00:20.750> block<00:00:20.929> another

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
also move through solid block another

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.019 
also move through solid block another
thing<00:00:21.560> I<00:00:21.710> need<00:00:21.949> to<00:00:22.070> mention<00:00:22.220> is<00:00:22.640> that<00:00:22.849> this

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
thing I need to mention is that this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.269 
thing I need to mention is that this
elevator<00:00:23.539> is<00:00:23.630> based<00:00:24.080> upon<00:00:24.289> a<00:00:24.470> bug<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.070> that

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
elevator is based upon a bug and that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.939 
elevator is based upon a bug and that
means<00:00:25.550> that<00:00:25.820> in<00:00:26.000> certain<00:00:26.810> circumstances<00:00:27.230> it

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
means that in certain circumstances it

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.860 
means that in certain circumstances it
won't<00:00:28.220> always<00:00:28.519> work<00:00:28.730> 100%<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:31.360> this<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.570> what

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
won't always work 100% and this is what

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.170 
won't always work 100% and this is what
the<00:00:33.080> item<00:00:33.410> elevator<00:00:33.620> looks<00:00:34.130> like<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:34.880> as<00:00:35.030> you

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
the item elevator looks like so as you

water<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.880> then<00:00:38.210> they<00:00:38.360> make<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.630> turn<00:00:38.990> and<00:00:39.170> go

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
water and then they make a turn and go

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.700
