00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.119
 look at 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.150
 upakovochku who tell me that although it 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.060
 many guess what it is maternal 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:33.650
 plan let's look at this 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:39.070
 wonderful organ here we have 22 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.070
 nanometer supported radeon graphics 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:49.190
 intel b75 chipset 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:50.530
 here it is indicated in the title here is something 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.870
 incomprehensible 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.610
 compatible with windows myself and by the way here 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.039
 It is written that he supports crossfire 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.149
 but now we will see for ourselves by the way 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.530
 windows 8 also supports and visible 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.280
 also supports the graphics engine in 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.509
 just means here we have a picture about 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.729
 overclocking 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.729
 that is, it is suitable for overclocking 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.399
 here we have a lot of marketing 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.399
 bullshit 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.990
 I do not know how to describe it in general, it is new 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.310
 the good 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.929
 there must be a Russian somewhere 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.229
 Russian 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:44.509
 support for intel core ahim processors and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.209
 5th 3rd premium we isolate and not 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:57.069
 only sandy bridge 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:59.390
 but also ivy beach slot pisya express 30 16 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.789
 high speed memory support 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.500
 ddr3 standard 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.920
 but this is basically standard controllers 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.769
 hd audio and ethernet 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.290
 waste paper rule 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:45.840
 why kolo tour work 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.349

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.739

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.599
 trail of a fact because all sata 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.019

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.569
 adapters 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.569

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.430
 pysyay express crossfire supports 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.430
 ddr3 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:39.390

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:59.080
 gigabit whatever this side we 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.350
 we have audio outputs 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.480
 but if you are professional 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:11.200
 sound engineer let's say you should still 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:16.840
 buy audio card is not suitable for 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.650
