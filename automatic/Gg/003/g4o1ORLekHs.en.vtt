00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.189
 the works we woke up from 8 and today it goes 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.300
 make help with what they saw 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.920
 first used a fitch band of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.699
 corpse because of children 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:25.789
 the first contact of either ball 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.789
 goes doubling the number well perfectly 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:35.710
 the second step that opens and closes the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.710
 mincult fold 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.170
 no high even 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 now it's different it's going to double to 10 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:07.630
 always as guidance to me that you 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.729
 did at first bring closed plane 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.689
 now a lot of attention 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:19.659
 you have the option of using a ruler to 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.920
 make a square here two and a half by 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 26 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 I'll use the ue261 cut rule 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.040
 it is not mandatory to use the rule that I am 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.040
 I'm using here to get easier 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:06.250
 exchange if you have made the perfect 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.250
 airplane will fly very well now you know 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:27.340
 shopping with qe2 as in the beginning 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:27.340
 plane is also going to see you deleted the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.570
 in the said redoubling both at the same time 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 for you have not I do not remember in that way 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.670
 measure in the end still worked 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:03:03.310
 that the nozzle inside the line 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:03:07.180
 opposite the opposite fold and there that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.180
 we started here at the tip 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.409
 then that's it 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.520
 said
