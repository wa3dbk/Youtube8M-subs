hi this is Kevin ball viki.com in this
video<00:00:17.310> what<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> want<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.790> look<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.330> a

video what I want to look at is a

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.910 
video what I want to look at is a
technique<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.050> retouching<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:19.800> going

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
technique for retouching I'm not going

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.620 
technique for retouching I'm not going
to<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.070> looking<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.369> retouching<00:00:20.910> per<00:00:21.060> se<00:00:21.300> just

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
to be looking at retouching per se just

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
to be looking at retouching per se just
a<00:00:21.810> particular<00:00:22.380> technique<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.730> use

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
a particular technique that you can use

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.950 
a particular technique that you can use
when<00:00:24.270> retouching<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
when retouching and this is the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
when retouching and this is the
frequency<00:00:27.960> separation<00:00:28.170> technique<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.490> what

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
frequency separation technique so what

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.770 
frequency separation technique so what
I'm<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.180> first<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.460> to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
I'm going to do first of all is to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.689 
I'm going to do first of all is to
transform<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.900> image<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.949> it's<00:00:35.340> currently

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
transform the image from it's currently

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.430 
transform the image from it's currently
an<00:00:35.790> 8-bit<00:00:36.239> image<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.930> transform<00:00:37.290> it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
an 8-bit image I'm going to transform it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.510 
an 8-bit image I'm going to transform it
to<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.710> 16-bit<00:00:38.370> image<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:39.630> is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.930> best<00:00:40.520> mode

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to a 16-bit image which is the best mode

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.930 
to a 16-bit image which is the best mode
just<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> work<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> can

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just do this kind of work in now you can

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.569 
just do this kind of work in now you can
work<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.719> 8-bit<00:00:46.170> mode<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.070> separate<00:00:47.430> video

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
work in 8-bit mode in a separate video

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.860 
work in 8-bit mode in a separate video
I'm<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> settings<00:00:48.780> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
I'm going to have the settings that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
I'm going to have the settings that
you're<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:50.129> work<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.700> 8-bit

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you're going to need to work in 8-bit

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.049 
you're going to need to work in 8-bit
mode<00:00:51.450> right<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.100> thing<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.610> once<00:00:53.910> we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
mode right so the first thing is once we

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.600 
mode right so the first thing is once we
are<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.270> 16-bit<00:00:54.870> mode<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.739> need<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.129> create

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
are in 16-bit mode we need to create

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
are in 16-bit mode we need to create
three<00:00:57.239> copies<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:58.110> our<00:00:58.440> original<00:00:58.860> image<00:00:59.070> I'm

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
three copies of our original image I'm

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.779 
three copies of our original image I'm
going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:01.170> ctrl<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.920> command<00:01:01.949> J<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
going to use ctrl or command J on the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.029 
going to use ctrl or command J on the
keyboard<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.270> create<00:01:03.539> these<00:01:03.690> copies<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
keyboard to create these copies the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.760 
keyboard to create these copies the
first<00:01:05.789> copy<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.869> middle<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
first copy in the middle one in the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
first copy in the middle one in the
middle<00:01:08.009> I'm<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> call<00:01:09.260> low-frequency

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
middle I'm going to call low-frequency

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
middle I'm going to call low-frequency
and<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:13.250> top<00:01:14.250> layer<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> call<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and the top layer I'm going to call a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
and the top layer I'm going to call a
high<00:01:16.200> frequency<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:18.470> what<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
high frequency and what I want to do is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
high frequency and what I want to do is
to<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> low<00:01:20.759> frequency<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to go to the low frequency there with a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.950 
to go to the low frequency there with a
switch<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> high<00:01:23.189> frequency<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> on

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
switch of the high frequency one and on

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.510 
switch of the high frequency one and on
the<00:01:25.110> low<00:01:25.380> frequency<00:01:25.890> layer<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the low frequency layer I'm going to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.140 
the low frequency layer I'm going to
choose<00:01:26.759> filter<00:01:27.689> blur<00:01:28.640> Gaussian<00:01:29.640> blur

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
choose filter blur Gaussian blur

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.319 
choose filter blur Gaussian blur
now<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.860> blur<00:01:32.130> setting<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.150> for

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
now the blur setting that you use for

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.109 
now the blur setting that you use for
your<00:01:33.479> image<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.079> depend<00:01:34.530> entirely<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.759> your

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
your image will depend entirely on your

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
your image will depend entirely on your
image<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.530> image<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
image so in this image I'm going to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.179 
image so in this image I'm going to
choose<00:01:38.490> ten<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> reason<00:01:39.900> why<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
choose ten and the reason why is if I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
choose ten and the reason why is if I
switch<00:01:41.400> off<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> preview<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.590> few

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
switch off the preview we can see a few

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.429 
switch off the preview we can see a few
blemishes<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.549> face<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.930> those

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
blemishes on the face and all those

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.889 
blemishes on the face and all those
blemishes<00:01:47.040> disappear<00:01:47.729> once<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> ten

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
blemishes disappear once we get to ten

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.460 
blemishes disappear once we get to ten
pixels<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:51.299> reason<00:01:51.659> that's<00:01:51.840> important

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
pixels and the reason that's important

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.139 
pixels and the reason that's important
will<00:01:52.560> become<00:01:52.860> obvious<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.430> later<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> I'm

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
will become obvious a bit later on I'm

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.499 
will become obvious a bit later on I'm
gonna<00:01:55.079> hit<00:01:55.380> OK<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> turn

of all we're going to choose the layer
as<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.450> low<00:02:12.780> frequency<00:02:13.440> layer<00:02:13.970> we're<00:02:14.970> going

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
as the low frequency layer we're going

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.790 
as the low frequency layer we're going
to<00:02:15.180> go<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> blending<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.290> we're<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.739> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
to go to blending and we're going to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.710 
to go to blending and we're going to
choose

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
choose

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.370 
choose
add<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:19.400> scale<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.300> going<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.660> be<00:02:20.780> two<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
add the scale is going to be two and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.180 
add the scale is going to be two and
we're<00:02:22.220> going<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.430> choose<00:02:22.580> invert<00:02:24.190> everything

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
we're going to choose invert everything

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.840 
we're going to choose invert everything
else<00:02:25.370> preserve<00:02:26.380> transparency<00:02:27.380> mask<00:02:28.070> has<00:02:28.700> to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
else preserve transparency mask has to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.540 
else preserve transparency mask has to
be<00:02:28.940> sweet<00:02:29.240> kept<00:02:29.810> off<00:02:30.130> offset<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.250> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.460> be

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
be sweet kept off offset is going to be

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.700 
be sweet kept off offset is going to be
kept<00:02:31.730> at<00:02:31.850> zero<00:02:32.150> opacity<00:02:32.750> at<00:02:32.840> 100%

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
kept at zero opacity at 100%

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.370 
kept at zero opacity at 100%
so<00:02:34.220> basically<00:02:34.610> we<00:02:35.240> choose<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.660> low<00:02:35.840> frequency

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
so basically we choose the low frequency

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.850 
so basically we choose the low frequency
there

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
there

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.970 
there
blending<00:02:37.850> mode<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.270> ad<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.200> scale<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.710> two

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
blending mode of ad and a scale of two

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.800 
blending mode of ad and a scale of two
you<00:02:40.640> will<00:02:40.760> need<00:02:40.910> different<00:02:41.090> settings<00:02:41.630> if

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
you will need different settings if

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690 
you will need different settings if
you're<00:02:41.960> working<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.350> 8-bit<00:02:42.560> mode<00:02:42.950> I'm<00:02:43.550> going

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
you're working in 8-bit mode I'm going

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.510 
you're working in 8-bit mode I'm going
to<00:02:43.790> hit<00:02:44.000> OK<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.650> we've<00:02:45.800> got<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.130> kind

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
to hit OK and what we've got is a kind

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.610 
to hit OK and what we've got is a kind
of<00:02:46.640> layer<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.090> looks<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.450> high<00:02:48.260> pass

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
of layer that looks like a high pass

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.160 
of layer that looks like a high pass
filter<00:02:49.130> layer<00:02:49.540> instead<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.690> putting<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.020> on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
filter layer instead of putting this on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.870 
filter layer instead of putting this on
overlay<00:02:51.650> as<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.040> would<00:02:52.250> with<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.460> high<00:02:52.670> pass

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
overlay as we would with a high pass

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.730 
overlay as we would with a high pass
filter<00:02:53.390> we're<00:02:53.660> gonna<00:02:53.810> put<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.260> linear

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
filter we're gonna put it on linear

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.280 
filter we're gonna put it on linear
light<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.430> what<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.390> should<00:02:56.720> do<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.140> give

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
light and what that should do is to give

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.590 
light and what that should do is to give
us<00:02:57.410> an<00:02:57.560> an<00:02:57.740> image<00:02:58.580> made<00:02:59.000> up<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.450> high

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
us an an image made up of the high

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.050 
us an an image made up of the high
frequency<00:03:00.170> layer<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.770> low<00:03:01.430> frequency

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
frequency layer and the low frequency

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.330 
frequency layer and the low frequency
layer<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.870> looks<00:03:03.170> remarkably<00:03:03.530> similar<00:03:04.130> to

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
layer that looks remarkably similar to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.800 
layer that looks remarkably similar to
our<00:03:04.820> original<00:03:05.180> image<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.050> in<00:03:06.830> fact<00:03:07.130> if<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.810> turn

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
our original image and in fact if I turn

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.260 
our original image and in fact if I turn
them<00:03:08.990> all<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.830> then<00:03:10.130> just<00:03:10.430> turn<00:03:10.820> on<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
them all on and then just turn on the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.440 
them all on and then just turn on the
original<00:03:11.780> by<00:03:11.990> alt<00:03:12.470> or<00:03:13.010> option<00:03:13.520> clicking<00:03:14.270> on

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
original by alt or option clicking on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.020 
original by alt or option clicking on
the<00:03:14.630> eye<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.320> original<00:03:15.830> you'll<00:03:16.580> see<00:03:16.820> that

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
the eye for the original you'll see that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.120 
the eye for the original you'll see that
there<00:03:17.240> is<00:03:17.270> practically<00:03:18.170> no<00:03:18.290> difference<00:03:18.500> so

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
there is practically no difference so

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.690 
there is practically no difference so
we've<00:03:19.310> got<00:03:19.570> two<00:03:20.570> copies<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.380> same<00:03:21.530> image

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
we've got two copies of the same image

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.060 
we've got two copies of the same image
one<00:03:22.700> consisting<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.270> one<00:03:23.480> layer<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.070> another

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
one consisting of one layer and another

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.130 
one consisting of one layer and another
copy<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.060> image<00:03:26.209> consisting<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.959> two

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
copy of the image consisting of two

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.860 
copy of the image consisting of two
layers<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.550> trick<00:03:28.850> here<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.600> work

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
layers and the trick here is to work

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.530 
layers and the trick here is to work
mainly<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.070> high<00:03:31.220> frequency<00:03:31.760> layer<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
mainly on the high frequency layer so

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.840 
mainly on the high frequency layer so
let's<00:03:32.750> get<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.610> first<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.730> all

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
let's get going with that first of all

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.790 
let's get going with that first of all
I'm<00:03:34.970> going<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.209> choose<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:36.020> healing<00:03:36.680> brush

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
I'm going to choose the healing brush

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.130 
I'm going to choose the healing brush
tool<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.489> wherever<00:03:38.270> I've<00:03:38.510> got<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> blemish

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
tool and wherever I've got a blemish

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.260 
tool and wherever I've got a blemish
working<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.160> high<00:03:40.340> frequency<00:03:40.850> layer<00:03:41.060> I'm

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
working on the high frequency layer I'm

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.740 
working on the high frequency layer I'm
going<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.900> choose<00:03:42.170> current<00:03:42.800> layer<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
going to choose current layer for the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.380 
going to choose current layer for the
sample<00:03:45.410> I'm<00:03:46.010> going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.280> work<00:03:46.400> Non<00:03:46.670> Aligned<00:03:47.030> but

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
sample I'm going to work Non Aligned but

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.520 
sample I'm going to work Non Aligned but
you<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.600> work<00:03:47.750> with<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.930> line<00:03:48.080> if<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.380> want

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
you can work with the line if you want

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.270 
you can work with the line if you want
and<00:03:48.920> on<00:03:49.310> normal<00:03:50.060> mode<00:03:50.500> with<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.650> source<00:03:52.040> as

and on normal mode with the source as

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.300 
and on normal mode with the source as
sampled<00:03:53.209> now<00:03:53.989> first<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.590> all<00:03:54.769> I'm<00:03:54.980> going<00:03:55.250> to

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
sampled now first of all I'm going to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.860 
sampled now first of all I'm going to
sample<00:03:55.580> I'm<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.060> going<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.239> reduce<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.630> size

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
sample I'm just going to reduce the size

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.050 
sample I'm just going to reduce the size
of<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.110> brush<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.709> I'm<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.610> sample<00:03:58.850> an

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
of the brush and I'm going to sample an

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.570 
of the brush and I'm going to sample an
area<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.600> basically<00:04:00.110> cover<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:02.410> blemish<00:04:03.580> so

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
area and basically cover the blemish so

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.850 
area and basically cover the blemish so
this<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.060> basically<00:04:05.420> painting<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.140> what<00:04:06.769> you

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
this is basically painting and what you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.460

of getting around that now as you can
see<00:04:42.200> we've<00:04:42.350> made<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.560> lot<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.890> progress<00:04:43.220> we

see we've made a lot of progress we

see we've made a lot of progress we

could make further progress if I wanted

could make further progress if I wanted
to<00:04:46.660> what<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:47.690> want<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.990> demonstrate<00:04:48.080> however<00:04:48.830> is

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
to what I want to demonstrate however is

to what I want to demonstrate however is
the<00:04:49.520> power<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.210> technique<00:04:50.660> if<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.020> wanted

the power of this technique if I wanted

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.500 
the power of this technique if I wanted
for<00:04:51.440> instance<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.980> smooth<00:04:52.430> out<00:04:52.610> all<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.060> the

you go with this kind of work now before
I<00:05:23.810> go<00:05:24.350> I<00:05:24.380> wanted<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.950> show<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.130> one<00:05:25.490> other

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
I go I wanted to show you one other

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.180 
I go I wanted to show you one other
thing<00:05:25.730> I've<00:05:26.300> redone<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.140> entire<00:05:27.410> thing<00:05:27.740> in

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
thing I've redone the entire thing in

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.700 
thing I've redone the entire thing in
two<00:05:28.760> different<00:05:28.940> ways<00:05:29.270> I've<00:05:29.540> written<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.290> using

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
two different ways I've written it using

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.860 
two different ways I've written it using
Gaussian<00:05:31.250> blur<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.640> also<00:05:32.300> using<00:05:32.600> surface

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
Gaussian blur and also using surface

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.350 
Gaussian blur and also using surface
blur<00:05:33.370> generally<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.460> get<00:05:34.610> very<00:05:34.790> good<00:05:34.940> results

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
blur generally you get very good results

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.760 
blur generally you get very good results
as<00:05:35.420> you<00:05:35.450> can<00:05:35.660> see<00:05:35.870> there<00:05:36.140> using<00:05:36.620> either

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
as you can see there using either

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.070 
as you can see there using either
technique<00:05:37.250> however<00:05:37.910> there<00:05:38.270> was<00:05:38.360> one<00:05:38.660> tiny

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
technique however there was one tiny

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.960 
technique however there was one tiny
advantage<00:05:39.650> for<00:05:39.860> surface<00:05:40.160> blur<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.730> wanted

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
advantage for surface blur and I wanted

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.790 
advantage for surface blur and I wanted
to<00:05:41.090> demonstrate<00:05:41.570> that<00:05:41.750> with<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.470> surface

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
to demonstrate that with the surface

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.180 
to demonstrate that with the surface
blur<00:05:43.010> if<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.370> go<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.640> an<00:05:44.150> edge<00:05:44.750> here<00:05:45.230> and<00:05:45.470> if<00:05:46.070> I

blur if I go to an edge here and if I

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
Gaussian blur when we get close to the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.780 
Gaussian blur when we get close to the
edge<00:05:58.970> if<00:05:59.780> I<00:05:59.990> sample<00:06:00.530> there<00:06:01.100> for<00:06:01.310> instance<00:06:01.640> and

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
edge if I sample there for instance and

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.120 
edge if I sample there for instance and
then<00:06:01.850> think<00:06:02.240> there<00:06:02.480> we<00:06:02.960> can<00:06:03.260> lose<00:06:03.530> edges<00:06:03.980> and

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
then think there we can lose edges and

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.250 
then think there we can lose edges and
this<00:06:04.220> is<00:06:04.370> because<00:06:04.700> Gaussian<00:06:05.690> blur<00:06:05.870> doesn't

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
this is because Gaussian blur doesn't

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.840 
this is because Gaussian blur doesn't
respect<00:06:06.530> edges<00:06:06.980> in<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.220> way<00:06:07.310> that<00:06:07.490> surface

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
respect edges in the way that surface

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.910 
respect edges in the way that surface
blur<00:06:08.030> does<00:06:08.300> so<00:06:08.660> that's<00:06:08.960> one<00:06:09.200> thing<00:06:09.410> to<00:06:09.620> take

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
blur does so that's one thing to take

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.020 
blur does so that's one thing to take
into<00:06:10.160> consideration<00:06:10.190> when<00:06:11.000> you're

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
into consideration when you're

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.330 
into consideration when you're
considering<00:06:11.420> how<00:06:11.570> to<00:06:11.630> go<00:06:11.750> about<00:06:11.930> this<00:06:12.140> now<00:06:12.530> if

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
considering how to go about this now if

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.430 
considering how to go about this now if
you're<00:06:13.520> working<00:06:13.700> 16-bit<00:06:14.420> mode<00:06:14.630> as<00:06:14.870> I<00:06:14.990> am<00:06:15.200> and

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
you're working 16-bit mode as I am and

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.870 
you're working 16-bit mode as I am and
you<00:06:15.650> want<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:15.890> go<00:06:16.010> back<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.310> working<00:06:16.490> in<00:06:16.670> 8-bit

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
you want to go back to working in 8-bit

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.120 
you want to go back to working in 8-bit
mode<00:06:17.240> it's<00:06:17.990> important<00:06:18.380> that<00:06:18.410> you<00:06:18.560> flatten<00:06:18.860> the

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
mode it's important that you flatten the

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.400 
mode it's important that you flatten the
image<00:06:19.160> before<00:06:19.640> going<00:06:19.970> back<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.360> work<00:06:20.720> in<00:06:20.870> 8-bit

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
image before going back to work in 8-bit

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.280 
image before going back to work in 8-bit
mode<00:06:21.800> so<00:06:22.280> what<00:06:22.460> you<00:06:22.550> might<00:06:22.760> do<00:06:23.030> is<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.930> go<00:06:24.230> to

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
mode so what you might do is to go to

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.090 
mode so what you might do is to go to
image<00:06:25.330> duplicate<00:06:26.440> create<00:06:27.440> another<00:06:27.650> copy<00:06:27.950> of

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
image duplicate create another copy of

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.600 
image duplicate create another copy of
Thea<00:06:28.400> image<00:06:28.790> then<00:06:29.540> to<00:06:29.750> layer<00:06:30.200> flatten<00:06:31.190> image

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
Thea image then to layer flatten image

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.910 
Thea image then to layer flatten image
and<00:06:32.120> once<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:32.900> image<00:06:33.170> is<00:06:33.230> flat<00:06:33.500> and<00:06:33.740> then<00:06:33.890> you

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
and once the image is flat and then you

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.160 
and once the image is flat and then you
can<00:06:34.190> change<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.610> mode<00:06:34.640> and<00:06:35.030> what<00:06:35.630> that<00:06:35.870> does

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
can change the mode and what that does

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.500 
can change the mode and what that does
is<00:06:36.500> that<00:06:36.530> all<00:06:36.920> the<00:06:37.280> goodness<00:06:37.550> or<00:06:37.910> the<00:06:38.060> benefits

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
is that all the goodness or the benefits

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.530 
is that all the goodness or the benefits
of<00:06:38.600> using<00:06:38.860> 16-bit<00:06:39.860> mode<00:06:40.160> are<00:06:40.430> then<00:06:41.060> imprinted

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
of using 16-bit mode are then imprinted

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.750 
of using 16-bit mode are then imprinted
into<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:42.110> pixels<00:06:42.560> when<00:06:43.010> you<00:06:43.130> go<00:06:43.250> back<00:06:43.460> down<00:06:43.700> to

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
into the pixels when you go back down to

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.980 
into the pixels when you go back down to
8-bit<00:06:44.360> mode

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
8-bit mode

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.999 
8-bit mode
so<00:06:45.289> that's<00:06:45.919> I<00:06:46.400> hope<00:06:46.819> been<00:06:47.240> very<00:06:47.509> helpful<00:06:48.009> thank
