set an example for my younger sisters so
at<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.810> moment<00:03:17.870> when<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:18.380> said<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.950> wasn't

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
at that moment when I said that I wasn't

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.890 
at that moment when I said that I wasn't
a<00:03:19.459> hundred<00:03:19.580> percent<00:03:19.760> sure<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.540> was<00:03:20.690> going

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
a hundred percent sure that I was going

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
guess to stay natural and to try to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.100 
guess to stay natural and to try to
embrace<00:03:26.780> her<00:03:26.930> natural<00:03:27.260> hair<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.209> as<00:03:29.209> time<00:03:29.900> went

embrace her natural hair so as time went

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.440 
embrace her natural hair so as time went
on<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.620> actually<00:03:31.040> started<00:03:31.519> off<00:03:31.700> as<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> stretch

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
for me I was a hundred percent sure that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.430 
for me I was a hundred percent sure that
I<00:03:34.190> was<00:03:34.340> going<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.790> actually<00:03:35.000> transition<00:03:35.690> but
