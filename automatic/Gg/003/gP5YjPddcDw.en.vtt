00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello, today I want to show how 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.360
 you can hang a hammock but with one 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 provided if we say so on one 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.520
 straight grow two trees like this and here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:29.330
 then we need to do to us 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.330
 usually need a rope so that's 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.510
 Is household rope household? 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.510
 you call the right one 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:46.829
 let's say how many meters 10 to us and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.920
 will need later and we will need more 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.940
 the same rope but let's say it is connected and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.940
 in the ring subway-2 and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 we will need another carbine any 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.590
 do you like here such that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.229
 screwed up 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.840
 on the spring which is pressed without 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.210
 the difference in this more like us 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.500
 retirement is all we need us in 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:26.860
 duplicate that tree 2 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:30.100
 so where do we start so the rope 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 which we have 10 meters to less 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.630
 carl so winding and around the tree 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.630
 fold it twice 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:49.649
 then take the pen us bound in a ring and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.649
 add it up 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:02:00.569
 1 2 2 times in half to get 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.479
 hand ring but out of four dude 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.300
 now we only need to wrap 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:13.900
 it's all a matter of stretching wood around 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:16.440
 it was firmly fixed we take 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.440
 upholstery 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.360
 we put height but does not know depends 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.360
 How far away are the trees 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.269
 we shift the piece that is connected in 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.390
 ring 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.390
 believed her 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.590
 we wind 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.590
 so we fix it 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:52.150
 bake just keeps everyone and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.150
 wrapping this 1 tree 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.270
 so it turned out such a loop to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 which we hang in front of him further 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.660
 we think 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.660
 Now 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.980
 wrapping our players around the tree 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.830
 dress carbine 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.830
 do the same process on the second weight 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:24.370
 after we fixed on both 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:27.330
 trees carbine hang them to us 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.330
 it only remains 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.979
 hang a hammock on them and relax on it 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.720
 that's all 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.720
 all until we meet again bye
