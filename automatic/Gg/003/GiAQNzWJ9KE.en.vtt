00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.359
 ah 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.560
 all right 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.209
 yes 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.059
 the granite of corn an evaporated milk 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 and this salt and pepper and what I see is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.030
 that those are complete I love it because 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 brings onion garlic oregano parsley all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.530
 everything brings you here and it 's the truth that you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 dan are very very rich to everything what 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.790
 that cooks and how good is this salt 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.710
 but not much league add environmental 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.769
 that what is now in me 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.010
 name I'm going to light the little ones for a 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.000
 I'm going to put a little bit of oil 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.570
 so that they will not have me 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.780
 things 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.260
 little bit more and then I'm going to take my can 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 of lots 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.120
 to see so much that I'm going to remove it as 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.580
 requested that you have 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.820
 then I'm going to open it 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.820
 and I'm going to put it under my 6 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.579
 of many species 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.579
 is the water has water 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 also a tree 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.590
 I'm going to put it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.810
 you can not improve 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.119
 a little 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.330
 because they see that all this is at low fire 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.890
 and you could add that they want 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.200
 Onion I 'm not going to add that the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.180
 flavor of the onion is also sweet and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160
 if we add to this the greens that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.709
 they are sweet and the onion that can not be 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.709
 for being a bit super sweet rather 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.710
 what we are going to do is metallic now 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.780
 let's grab our little balls come out 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.260
 blender I already have what a cup is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.080
 fetal caring more or less and in my I already 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.240
 I have as well as a small amount and 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.680
 This is going to use for the cream 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.560
 the time that we liquefy it also such 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.460
 like those granites of the hotel or good 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.320
 you know what I say is condensed milk 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.120
 the evaporated already know that there is 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.240
 clean well the two cans so that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.990
 do not fit like a brush 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.990
 and has gone through there 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.020
 although I will move on to do is place my 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.020
 cream of milk 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.680
 good 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.190
 and what I'm going to do, I 'm going to move on 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.500
 liquefy how hot are the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.420
 editor I'm going to put a rag and I do not 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.930
 liquefied so you do not go to vote 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.370
 I'm going to liquefy the mixture when I tell them 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.580
 that you do not have to cover up what I 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.470
 I mean it is not like the little thing 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.810
 what's up here so that we do not 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.900
 go as you want to vote then I'll 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.940
 What I do is leave it like that and cover it with 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.910
 a washcloth or something like that is not something left 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.550
 more or less like that or very good and it's 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.140
 liquefied then we will move on to make 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.340
 now it's happening to our do now 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.340
 our pan 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.350
 do what 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.350
 revelations of learning it and 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.160
 and we will not warn what is the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.090
 our 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.410
 ah 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.449
 I use is in spoon for me to 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.260
 prepare it because this way when moving 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.500
 the allows me to go adding is allows you 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.250
 go stirring perfectly from 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.250
 inside is fine 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.490
 the litter more 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.340
 it's a bunch of here 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.320
 let's give back that's what gave him 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.569
 this spoon that allows me to mix it 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.729
 completely 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.279
 and it lets me perfectly mix what 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.279
 it's the bed, we're all going to leave it to action 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.200
 I 'm not hanging it or anything because 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.970
 I want it to have that consistency of 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.970
 then of the three suns 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.080
 cook to start missing 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.059
 ah 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.430
 let's just take a little splash of 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.050
 milk 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.050
 so lightly a little 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.650
 we want it to be 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.490
 liberal and treatment as we will see 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.490
 a little lesson 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.090
 was born as a national half cup 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.590
 of milk more or less now we are going to 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.870
 add the sauces 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.580
 I am going to add this that is the person 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.580
 complete and I'm just going to do the following 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.100
 that will be something like that a bit and with this 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.540
 comes very whole what I'm going to do is 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.540
 I'm going to grind it 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.590
 and now I'm going back 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.790
 and we're going to let them continue the time 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:41.370
 it's a soup more than half 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.770
 because the cream 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.140
 Here we are going to leave them to remove it 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.460
 a little of the fire because no 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.460
 let's cook
