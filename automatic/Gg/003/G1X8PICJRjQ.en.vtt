00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.009
 sport and the development of sport in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.140
 Morocco is one of the vectors of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.329
 general development of the country as well 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 socially than on the plane 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.450
 economic it's one of justin's wagons 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.579
 of the social economic train and we see it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 it suffices that I leave it as an example 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 they quote the Moroccan national team 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.930
 wins so that it boosts a little 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.930
 the economy or kandahar and lada holland 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 chabab will admit it tagada tagada la soul 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.409
 or sport it's a philosophy of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.240
 life 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.240
 it's an extraordinary social phenomenon 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.600
 it's something that can make you 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.130
 forget even the biggest hassle the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.390
 Moroccan games and the first 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.050
 contributor of sport development 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.670
 in Morocco 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.080
 our core business and our role 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.850
 it's really the support and the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.620
 promotion of sport development 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.000
 you have to know that all of our 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.590
 profits are donated to a fund 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.670
 national which is really aimed at 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.040
 encourage all federations 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.450
 and which aims to encourage the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.030
 practice of sport in general 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.690
 but also internally we have a 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.220
 budget sponsorship or not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.320
 we support and encourage 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.940
 organized sports events in Morocco in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.140
 scale on the international cd but 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.090
 also smaller actions more 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.430
 located there is a large majority of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.750
 young muslim youth countries that are 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.090
 waiting for a lot of things and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.130
 the element that brings together the two I think 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 it's sport that allows opening 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.080
 and that's why we took care of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.820
 this youth population since 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.410
 when he begins to play football you 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.360
 forget everything and I am convinced that 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.110
 some will become true talents 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.820
 but at least the vast majority we 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.210
 know they are continuing their studies 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.520
 who are at school through basketball 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.350
 it is transmitted values ​​conveyed 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.180
 by the sport especially the challenge 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.190
 the spirit of solidarity with one 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.170
 reaches our results our 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.570
 objectives which are the development of the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 potential of the child through sport 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.590
 we have a very action program 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.390
 ambitious and to do that he's us 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.820

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.350
