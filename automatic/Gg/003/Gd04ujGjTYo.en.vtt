left now the unit that we're gonna be

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.110 
left now the unit that we're gonna be
looking<00:00:32.410> at<00:00:32.650> today<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.430> one<00:00:33.610> that's<00:00:33.880> meant

for<00:00:34.210> air<00:00:34.510> cooling<00:00:34.750> at<00:00:35.079> least<00:00:35.230> it<00:00:35.379> comes<00:00:35.620> air

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
for air cooling at least it comes air

for air cooling at least it comes air
cooled<00:00:36.460> what<00:00:36.969> I<00:00:37.000> mean<00:00:37.210> is<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.420> doesn't<00:00:37.539> come

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
cooled what I mean is it doesn't come

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.209 
cooled what I mean is it doesn't come
with<00:00:37.809> water<00:00:37.960> cooling<00:00:38.170> inside<00:00:38.649> there's<00:00:39.100> gonna

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
with water cooling inside there's gonna

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.459 
with water cooling inside there's gonna
be<00:00:39.370> two<00:00:39.550> units<00:00:39.699> this<00:00:40.359> one<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.780> can<00:00:41.050> water

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
be two units this one you can water

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.689 
be two units this one you can water
cools<00:00:41.769> we'll<00:00:41.980> show<00:00:42.129> you<00:00:42.160> when<00:00:42.340> we<00:00:42.399> get<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> it

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
cools we'll show you when we get to it

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.819 
cools we'll show you when we get to it

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
week or two actually comes with all the
water<00:00:50.440> cooling<00:00:50.710> stuff<00:00:50.980> already

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
water cooling stuff already

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.910 
water cooling stuff already
pre-installed<00:00:51.929> so<00:00:52.929> with<00:00:53.079> that<00:00:53.230> said<00:00:53.500> let's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
pre-installed so with that said let's

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.099 
pre-installed so with that said let's
jump<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.399> let's<00:00:54.730> see<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.269> had<00:00:55.660> Ron<00:00:55.929> and

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
jump in and let's see this had Ron and

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.200 
jump in and let's see this had Ron and
see<00:00:56.230> if<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:56.410> gives<00:00:56.559> us<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.829> hard-on<00:00:57.609> alright

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
see if it gives us a hard-on alright

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.389 
see if it gives us a hard-on alright
folks<00:00:58.420> there's<00:00:58.780> really<00:00:59.019> not<00:00:59.440> much<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.039> brown

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399

folks there's really not much this brown
box<00:01:00.789> packaging<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.600> mean<00:01:01.749> just<00:01:01.929> has<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.230> EVGA

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
box packaging I mean just has the EVGA

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.829 
box packaging I mean just has the EVGA
logo<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.309> name<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:04.089> only<00:01:04.360> important<00:01:04.809> thing

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
logo the name the only important thing

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.390 
logo the name the only important thing
on<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.199> at<00:01:05.290> all<00:01:05.410> would<00:01:05.800> probably<00:01:06.100> be<00:01:06.220> this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
on it at all would probably be this

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.520 
on it at all would probably be this
right<00:01:06.670> here<00:01:06.970> which<00:01:07.420> actually<00:01:07.659> describes<00:01:08.259> you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
right here which actually describes you

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.350 
right here which actually describes you
know<00:01:08.619> in<00:01:08.770> nomenclature<00:01:09.009> what<00:01:09.579> it<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:09.820> but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
know in nomenclature what it is but

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.730 
know in nomenclature what it is but
beyond<00:01:10.659> that<00:01:10.840> there's<00:01:11.049> not<00:01:11.200> much<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> box

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
beyond that there's not much to the box

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.200 
beyond that there's not much to the box
I'm<00:01:11.890> not<00:01:12.009> gonna<00:01:12.100> waste<00:01:12.280> time<00:01:12.369> I'm<00:01:12.790> gonna<00:01:12.939> flip

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
I'm not gonna waste time I'm gonna flip

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.690 
I'm not gonna waste time I'm gonna flip
my<00:01:13.240> little<00:01:13.570> knife<00:01:13.720> out<00:01:13.930> there<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.680> just<00:01:15.579> go

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
my little knife out there and just go

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.920 
my little knife out there and just go
ahead<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.000> start<00:01:16.119> taking<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.540> puppy<00:01:16.900> out

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
ahead and start taking this puppy out

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.889 
ahead and start taking this puppy out
make<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.920> nice<00:01:18.070> clean<00:01:18.250> slice<00:01:18.670> down<00:01:18.880> there<00:01:19.180> make

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
make a nice clean slice down there make

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.950 
make a nice clean slice down there make
another<00:01:20.170> slice<00:01:20.470> right<00:01:20.860> about<00:01:21.250> here<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.899> that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
another slice right about here and that

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.200 
another slice right about here and that
should<00:01:23.350> probably<00:01:23.649> do<00:01:24.070> pop<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.820> open<00:01:24.909> right

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
should probably do pop it open right

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.510 
should probably do pop it open right
there<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.930> little<00:01:26.470> bit<00:01:26.649> more<00:01:26.799> popping<00:01:27.159> sounds

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
there a little bit more popping sounds

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.840 
there a little bit more popping sounds
there<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.780> inside<00:01:29.170> we<00:01:29.500> see<00:01:29.979> we've<00:01:30.130> got<00:01:30.280> boxes

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
there so inside we see we've got boxes

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.179 
there so inside we see we've got boxes
within<00:01:31.060> boxes<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:31.990> there's<00:01:32.229> multiple<00:01:32.619> boxes

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
within boxes so there's multiple boxes

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.310 
within boxes so there's multiple boxes
so<00:01:33.850> let's<00:01:33.969> go<00:01:34.149> ahead<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.540> start<00:01:34.750> taking<00:01:35.140> stuff

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
so let's go ahead and start taking stuff

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.219 
so let's go ahead and start taking stuff
out<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> top<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:37.509> ahead<00:01:37.659> just<00:01:37.899> pull<00:01:38.110> this

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
out of the top go ahead just pull this

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.709 
out of the top go ahead just pull this
stuff<00:01:38.469> out<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:39.430> they'll<00:01:40.060> check<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.479> at<00:01:40.630> the
