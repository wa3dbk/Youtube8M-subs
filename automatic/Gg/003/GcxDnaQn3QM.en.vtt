hey everyone this is Prashant I sure
came<00:00:03.659> up<00:00:03.840> with<00:00:04.170> an<00:00:04.529> interesting<00:00:04.859> feature

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
came up with an interesting feature

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.170 
came up with an interesting feature
called

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
called

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.669 
called
swipe<00:00:06.960> right<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.620> swipe<00:00:08.069> left<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:09.170> I<00:00:10.170> find

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
swipe right and swipe left and I find

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.310 
swipe right and swipe left and I find
that<00:00:10.800> very<00:00:10.950> interesting<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.179> built<00:00:13.110> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
that very interesting so I built a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
that very interesting so I built a
sample<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.070> let<00:00:14.099> me<00:00:14.370> show<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> how<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.960> know

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
sample and let me show you how you know

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.120 
sample and let me show you how you know
one<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> uses<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:17.310> off<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.300> feature<00:00:19.130> for

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
one of the uses for off that feature for

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.330 
one of the uses for off that feature for
example<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.750> list<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.380> people

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
example if you have a list of people

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.890 
example if you have a list of people
that<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> display<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> list<00:00:24.720> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that you have to display or a list of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.540 
that you have to display or a list of
photographs<00:00:25.380> or<00:00:25.680> images<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.369> to

photographs or images that you have to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.710 
photographs or images that you have to
display<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.550> simply<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> swipe<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
display you can simply you know swipe it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.650 
display you can simply you know swipe it
to<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.439> left<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.980> swipe<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to the left or swipe it to the right and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
to the left or swipe it to the right and
using<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> cursor<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> an

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
using the cursor here because this is an

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
using the cursor here because this is an
on-screen<00:00:36.420> prototype<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.860> reality<00:00:38.070> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
on-screen prototype but in reality you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.310 
on-screen prototype but in reality you
would<00:00:38.550> probably<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.120> using<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.780> finger<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
would probably be using your finger to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.729 
would probably be using your finger to
do<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.649> left<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.500> you'll<00:00:43.500> notice

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
do this left or right and you'll notice

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.119 
do this left or right and you'll notice
that<00:00:43.890> there<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> small<00:00:45.180> dots<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.379> so

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that there is the small dots here so

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.580 
that there is the small dots here so
when<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.370> move<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> left<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.170> middle

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
when you move it to the left the middle

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.889 
when you move it to the left the middle
dot<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.219> highlighted<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.879> again<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
dot will be highlighted and again and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.540 
dot will be highlighted and again and
and<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.800> show<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> how<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> did

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and so on so let me show you how I did

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.830 
and so on so let me show you how I did
this<00:00:56.670> integer<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.739> juror<00:00:59.039> RP<00:00:59.840> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this integer so this is a juror RP the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
this integer so this is a juror RP the
application<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.760> I'm<00:01:02.760> making<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
application and I'm making the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
application and I'm making the
assumption<00:01:03.570> no<00:01:03.780> assumption<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.830> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
assumption no assumption that you know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.520 
assumption no assumption that you know
the<00:01:05.100> basics<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> did<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.369> created

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the basics so what I did was I created

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
the basics so what I did was I created
created<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.680> panel<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.780> created<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
created a panel and you know created a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039 
created a panel and you know created a
rectangle<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.490> turn<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
rectangle and then turn that into a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
rectangle and then turn that into a
dynamic<00:01:16.500> panel<00:01:16.680> by<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.340> right-clicking

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
dynamic panel by you know right-clicking

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
dynamic panel by you know right-clicking
on<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> saying<00:01:19.850> convert<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.330> dynamic

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
on it and saying convert to dynamic

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
on it and saying convert to dynamic
panel<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.330> then<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.200> added<00:01:26.479> three<00:01:27.479> layers

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
panel and then I I added three layers

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.700 
panel and then I I added three layers
because<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:29.150> 3-3<00:01:30.150> frames<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.049> what

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
because there are 3-3 frames here what

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
because there are 3-3 frames here what
you<00:01:31.799> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.520> need<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> add<00:01:32.909> three

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
you need to do is you need to add three

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.440 
you need to do is you need to add three
layers<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.290> said<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.340> state<00:01:36.150> once

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
layers so I said you know state once

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539 
layers so I said you know state once
actually<00:01:36.810> three<00:01:37.110> states<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.799> state<00:01:38.009> 1<00:01:38.220> state<00:01:38.250> 2

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
actually three states so state 1 state 2

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.770 
actually three states so state 1 state 2
state<00:01:38.729> 3<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.479> on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
state 3 and so on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010 
state 3 and so on
and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> dots<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.119> created<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and then for the dots I created a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710 
and then for the dots I created a
separate<00:01:43.790> here<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> created<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.329> separate

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
separate here I created a separate

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.399 
separate here I created a separate
dynamic<00:01:46.470> panel<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.570> also<00:01:48.570> created<00:01:49.229> three

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
dynamic panel and also created three

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.380 
dynamic panel and also created three
states<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.040> state<00:01:50.250> 1<00:01:50.490> state<00:01:50.520> 2<00:01:50.880> state<00:01:51.090> 3

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
states you know state 1 state 2 state 3

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.429 
states you know state 1 state 2 state 3
and<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.240> state<00:01:54.240> 1<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.509> first<00:01:54.960> dot<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and so on and state 1 the first dot is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.800 
and so on and state 1 the first dot is
highlighted<00:01:55.890> state<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.210> second<00:01:57.540> dot<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
highlighted state to the second dot is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
highlighted state to the second dot is
highlighted<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> state<00:01:58.619> 3<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.219> third<00:01:59.430> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
highlighted the state 3 the third is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
highlighted the state 3 the third is
highlighted<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:03.890> what<00:02:04.890> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
highlighted and so on and then what I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.809 
highlighted and so on and then what I
did<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:06.560> choose<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.829> particular<00:02:08.340> dynamic

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
did was choose this particular dynamic

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.309 
did was choose this particular dynamic
panel<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> right<00:02:10.319> side<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
panel and on the right side and

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.679 
panel and on the right side and

know<00:02:16.810> choose<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.109> case<00:02:17.469> and<00:02:17.799> say<00:02:18.430> set<00:02:19.139> this

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
know choose a case and say set this

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.259 
know choose a case and say set this
particular<00:02:20.739> state<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.400> next<00:02:21.819> loop<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
particular state to next loop and in a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.270 
particular state to next loop and in a
safety<00:02:25.889> set<00:02:26.889> the<00:02:27.659> time<00:02:28.659> that<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.230> want<00:02:29.439> to<00:02:29.739> you

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
safety set the time that you want to you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.209 
safety set the time that you want to you
want<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:31.019> slide<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.500> that's<00:02:32.739> that's<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.189> I

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
want to slide so that's that's what I

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.970 
want to slide so that's that's what I
did<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:34.120> at<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.200> same<00:02:35.230> time<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:35.769> also

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
did and then at the same time and also

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.360 
did and then at the same time and also
set<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.700> dots<00:02:36.969> also<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.079> next<00:02:38.319> loop<00:02:38.469> so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
set that dots also to the next loop so

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.119 
set that dots also to the next loop so
maybe<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:39.939> can<00:02:40.329> show<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.629> how<00:02:40.930> how<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.409> did<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.829> so

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
maybe I can show you how how I did it so

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.050 
maybe I can show you how how I did it so
in<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.549> particular<00:02:42.760> case<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:44.049> go<00:02:44.290> here<00:02:44.560> and

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
then you know set state set panel state

00:02:50.799 --> 00:03:00.050 
then you know set state set panel state
to<00:02:53.909> you<00:02:54.909> choose<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.419> and<00:02:57.269> come<00:02:58.269> here

to you choose that and come here
you<00:03:01.060> know<00:03:01.180> maybe<00:03:01.359> choose<00:03:01.629> choose<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.199> one

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
you know maybe choose choose this one

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.959 
you know maybe choose choose this one
and<00:03:03.810> go<00:03:04.810> here<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.290> say<00:03:05.560> set<00:03:06.010> select<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.730> state

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
and go here and say set select the state

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.309 
and go here and say set select the state
to<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.540> next<00:03:07.689> state<00:03:07.840> here<00:03:09.689> choose<00:03:10.689> choose<00:03:11.169> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
say the next state and then animate in

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.509 
say the next state and then animate in
say<00:03:18.790> slide<00:03:19.209> right<00:03:19.709> 400<00:03:20.709> milliseconds<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.459> you

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
say slide right 400 milliseconds and you

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.089 
say slide right 400 milliseconds and you
made<00:03:21.729> out<00:03:21.970> slide<00:03:22.569> right<00:03:22.919> 500<00:03:23.919> milliseconds

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
made out slide right 500 milliseconds

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.729 
made out slide right 500 milliseconds
you<00:03:24.430> know<00:03:24.549> that's<00:03:24.729> what<00:03:24.879> I<00:03:24.909> did<00:03:25.500> I'm<00:03:26.500> going<00:03:26.680> to

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
you know that's what I did I'm going to

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.849 
you know that's what I did I'm going to
cancel<00:03:26.949> this<00:03:27.189> right<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:29.560> know<00:03:29.590> once

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
cancel this right now so you know once

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.490 
cancel this right now so you know once
you<00:03:30.009> do<00:03:30.129> that<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.629> behavior<00:03:31.870> you

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
you do that this is the behavior you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.319 
you do that this is the behavior you
will<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.889> when<00:03:33.699> you<00:03:35.009> slide<00:03:36.009> left<00:03:36.370> this

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
will get when you slide left this

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.670 
will get when you slide left this
particular<00:03:38.129> panel<00:03:39.129> will<00:03:40.079> will<00:03:41.079> slide<00:03:41.379> right

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
particular panel will will slide right

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.759 
particular panel will will slide right
slide<00:03:41.949> right<00:03:42.639> and<00:03:43.030> when<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.139> this<00:03:44.290> particular

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
slide right and when and this particular

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.039 
slide right and when and this particular
thing<00:03:45.069> also<00:03:45.310> will<00:03:45.639> slide<00:03:45.909> right<00:03:45.939> which<00:03:46.810> means

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
thing also will slide right which means

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.780 
thing also will slide right which means
you<00:03:47.349> will<00:03:47.470> get<00:03:47.650> this<00:03:47.799> particular<00:03:47.979> window<00:03:48.519> and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
you will get this particular window and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.020 
you will get this particular window and
when<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.659> slide<00:03:49.900> left<00:03:50.199> this<00:03:50.709> one<00:03:50.979> will<00:03:51.340> slide

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
when you slide left this one will slide

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.999 
when you slide left this one will slide
right<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:53.769> on<00:03:53.889> so<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:56.290> find<00:03:56.919> this

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
right and and so on so I find this
