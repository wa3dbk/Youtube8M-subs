00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.320 
was even copyrighted and the only clue
to<00:02:08.709> his<00:02:08.920> existence<00:02:09.610> was<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.030> fact<00:02:10.240> that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
to his existence was the fact that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.390 
to his existence was the fact that
Mewtwo's<00:02:10.840> name<00:02:11.110> makes<00:02:11.470> him<00:02:11.650> sound<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
Mewtwo's name makes him sound like the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.090 
Mewtwo's name makes him sound like the
second<00:02:12.820> in<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.970> series<00:02:13.260> talk<00:02:14.260> about<00:02:14.530> Chekhov's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
gun right there I mean maybe he really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.920 
gun right there I mean maybe he really
is<00:02:17.470> an<00:02:17.890> ancestor<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.730> Pokemon<00:02:19.180> world<00:02:19.480> oh

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
is an ancestor of the Pokemon world oh

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.670 
is an ancestor of the Pokemon world oh
wait<00:02:20.740> that's<00:02:21.130> right<00:02:21.310> that's<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:23.200> DNA

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
wait that's right that's right use DNA

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.470 
wait that's right that's right use DNA
links<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> every<00:02:24.310> Pokemon<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.850> existence

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
links to every Pokemon in existence

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.150 
links to every Pokemon in existence
that's<00:02:25.990> why<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.320> live<00:02:26.500> anywhere<00:02:26.890> and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
that's why you can live anywhere and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.340 
that's why you can live anywhere and
learn<00:02:27.250> any<00:02:27.520> move<00:02:27.880> all<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:28.959> do<00:02:29.230> you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
learn any move all right but do you

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.230 
learn any move all right but do you
really<00:02:29.920> buy<00:02:30.130> into<00:02:30.310> all<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.700> stuff<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.120> mean

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
really buy into all that stuff I mean

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.270 
really buy into all that stuff I mean
there's<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.959> many<00:02:32.170> conflicting<00:02:32.620> stories

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
there's so many conflicting stories

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.670 
there's so many conflicting stories
about<00:02:33.310> where<00:02:33.820> Pokemon<00:02:34.390> come<00:02:34.630> from<00:02:34.930> seemingly

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
about where Pokemon come from seemingly

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.710 
about where Pokemon come from seemingly
conflicting<00:02:36.010> stories<00:02:36.700> old<00:02:36.910> satchel<00:02:37.180> old<00:02:37.480> pal

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
conflicting stories old satchel old pal

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.199 
conflicting stories old satchel old pal
right<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:38.739> our<00:02:38.950> job<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.790> put<00:02:39.910> them<00:02:40.090> all

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
right and it's our job to put them all

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.949 
right and it's our job to put them all
together

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
together

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.160 
together
oh<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.610> time<00:02:42.880> for<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.269> Pokemon

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
oh is it is it time for the Pokemon

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.860 
oh is it is it time for the Pokemon
creation<00:02:44.769> myth<00:02:46.860> yeah<00:02:47.890> etc<00:02:48.820> there<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.780> go

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
creation myth yeah etc there we go

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.360 
creation myth yeah etc there we go
wasn't<00:02:50.140> sure<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.350> was<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.590> board<00:02:50.800> for<00:02:50.950> sake

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.370 

so<00:02:54.370> musikdesign<00:02:54.910> does<00:02:55.300> look<00:02:55.630> pretty<00:02:55.780> cat-like

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
so musikdesign does look pretty cat-like

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.290 
so musikdesign does look pretty cat-like
but<00:02:56.860> I'd<00:02:56.950> say<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.250> looks<00:02:57.310> even<00:02:57.580> more<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:58.120> it's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
but I'd say it looks even more like it's

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.480 
but I'd say it looks even more like it's
based<00:02:58.540> off<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.810> developing<00:02:59.410> embryo<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.340> is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
based off a developing embryo this is

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.130 
based off a developing embryo this is
likely<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.060> fact<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.390> many<00:03:01.720> mammal

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
likely to the fact that many mammal

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.230 
likely to the fact that many mammal
embryo<00:03:02.470> start<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.070> quite<00:03:03.370> similar<00:03:03.850> looking

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
embryo start off quite similar looking

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.090 
embryo start off quite similar looking
until<00:03:04.780> they<00:03:04.900> develop<00:03:05.080> features<00:03:05.650> unique<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
until they develop features unique to

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.400 
until they develop features unique to
their<00:03:06.430> distinct<00:03:07.030> species<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:08.200> also

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
their distinct species it's also

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.930 
their distinct species it's also
probably<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:09.040> reference<00:03:09.460> to<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.670> largely

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
probably a reference to the largely

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.000 
probably a reference to the largely
discredited<00:03:10.270> recapitulation<00:03:11.260> theory<00:03:11.710> which

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
discredited recapitulation theory which

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.410 
discredited recapitulation theory which
basically<00:03:12.370> states<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.030> an<00:03:13.150> animal

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
basically states that as an animal

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.940 
basically states that as an animal
develops<00:03:13.810> from<00:03:13.870> embryo<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.350> adulthood

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
develops from embryo to adulthood

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.620 
develops from embryo to adulthood
it<00:03:15.100> shows<00:03:15.400> resemblance<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.060> other<00:03:16.210> creatures

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
it shows resemblance to other creatures

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.720 
it shows resemblance to other creatures
in<00:03:16.660> its<00:03:16.900> evolutionary<00:03:17.440> line<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.040> yeah<00:03:18.460> it's

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
in its evolutionary line and yeah it's

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.460 
in its evolutionary line and yeah it's
not<00:03:18.850> scientifically<00:03:19.510> accurate<00:03:19.840> but<00:03:20.350> maybe

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
not scientifically accurate but maybe

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.050 
not scientifically accurate but maybe
this<00:03:20.650> genetic<00:03:21.040> foreshadowing<00:03:21.700> tells<00:03:21.910> us

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
this genetic foreshadowing tells us

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.190 
this genetic foreshadowing tells us
something<00:03:22.240> about<00:03:22.360> Mews<00:03:22.690> placed<00:03:22.990> in<00:03:23.140> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
something about Mews placed in the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.410 
something about Mews placed in the
origin<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.710> Pokemon<00:03:24.310> alright<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:24.940> last<00:03:25.150> week

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
origin of Pokemon alright so last week

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.510 
origin of Pokemon alright so last week
you<00:03:25.450> guys<00:03:25.690> decided<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.500> pokemons<00:03:27.100> arrival

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
you guys decided that pokemons arrival

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.790 
you guys decided that pokemons arrival
was<00:03:27.670> intentional<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.780> they<00:03:29.290> exist<00:03:29.650> to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
was intentional and that they exist to

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.790 
was intentional and that they exist to
help<00:03:30.100> humans<00:03:30.520> along<00:03:30.850> towards<00:03:31.240> utopia<00:03:31.780> but<00:03:32.410> who

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
help humans along towards utopia but who

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.710 
help humans along towards utopia but who
sent<00:03:33.100> them<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.430> what's<00:03:33.610> their<00:03:33.820> biological

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
sent them and what's their biological

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.390 
sent them and what's their biological
origin<00:03:35.230> well<00:03:35.709> if<00:03:35.980> you've<00:03:36.130> been<00:03:36.250> following

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
origin well if you've been following

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.860 
origin well if you've been following
along<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.030> know<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.300> Arceus<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
along you know that Arceus is a

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.390 
along you know that Arceus is a
shape-shifting<00:03:38.500> space<00:03:38.800> mutant<00:03:39.130> that's<00:03:39.160> said

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
shape-shifting space mutant that's said

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.100 
shape-shifting space mutant that's said
to<00:03:39.430> have<00:03:39.580> created<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.090> universe<00:03:40.300> if<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:40.959> is

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
to have created the universe if this is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.900 
to have created the universe if this is
true<00:03:41.290> maybe<00:03:41.620> he<00:03:41.770> created<00:03:42.130> all<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.310> Pokemon<00:03:42.700> -

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
true maybe he created all the Pokemon -
