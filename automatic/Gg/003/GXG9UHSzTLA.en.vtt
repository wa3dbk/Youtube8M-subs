does have the lowest damage but

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
does have the lowest damage but
personally<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
personally I don't think it is the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.460 
personally I don't think it is the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
weakest I can't really feel fully

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.469

difference<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> worst

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
difference I don't think it's the worst

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I think it's pretty good it does have

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.660 
I think it's pretty good it does have
the<00:01:39.479> highest<00:01:39.689> accuracy<00:01:40.140> though<00:01:40.470> guys<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the highest accuracy though guys and I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
the highest accuracy though guys and I
think<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.939> pays<00:01:42.180> off<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.869> guess<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:43.470> my

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
think I pays off a lot and guess what my

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.760 
think I pays off a lot and guess what my
attachments<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.399> grip<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> red<00:01:45.299> dot<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
attachments are grip and red dot so the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
attachments are grip and red dot so the
accuracy<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.310> already<00:01:47.579> ten<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> ten<00:01:48.210> guys

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
accuracy is already ten out of ten guys

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
accuracy is already ten out of ten guys
and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> decide<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> grip<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.250> think

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and then I decide to use a grip I think

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.550 
and then I decide to use a grip I think
grip<00:01:50.790> dismayed<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> even<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.899> much<00:01:51.960> better

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
grip dismayed it even that much better

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.749 
grip dismayed it even that much better
it<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.700> i<00:01:54.000> thought<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.570> pretty

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
it really really i thought was pretty

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.050 
it really really i thought was pretty
pretty<00:01:56.759> beast<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.329> grip<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:59.060> would

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
pretty beast you know grip it is i would

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
pretty beast you know grip it is i would
really<00:02:00.329> isn't<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.719> crucial<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:02.070> your<00:02:02.250> feet

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
really isn't that crucial if your feet

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
really isn't that crucial if your feet
if<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.689> weapon<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.740> does

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
if I on weapon like this because it does

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.039 
if I on weapon like this because it does
have<00:02:04.860> pretty<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.399> accuracy<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.899> was

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
have pretty good accuracy but then I was

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
have pretty good accuracy but then I was
like<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.500> ice<00:02:07.619> telling<00:02:07.860> myself<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.280> fuck

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
like you know ice telling myself or fuck

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.300 
like you know ice telling myself or fuck
it<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.840> any<00:02:09.989> other<00:02:10.140> touch-<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.950> could

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it I don't see any other touch- I could

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
it I don't see any other touch- I could
have<00:02:11.400> used<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:11.940> extended<00:02:12.510> mags<00:02:12.690> which<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
have used you know extended mags which I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.210 
have used you know extended mags which I
think<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.800> been<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
think would have been a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
think would have been a
cool<00:02:14.970> attachment<00:02:15.690> indeed<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.200> know<00:02:16.320> because

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
cool attachment indeed you know because

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.780 
cool attachment indeed you know because
I<00:02:16.560> wouldn't<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.920> reload<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.520> much

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I wouldn't have to reload as much

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.240 
I wouldn't have to reload as much
especially<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.930> mgs<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.770> does<00:02:19.950> take<00:02:20.220> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
especially on mgs because it does take a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.660 
especially on mgs because it does take a
lot<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.730> time<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.390> reload<00:02:22.160> but<00:02:23.160> yeah<00:02:23.310> anyways

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
lot of time to reload but yeah anyways

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.250 
lot of time to reload but yeah anyways
the<00:02:23.820> second<00:02:24.180> plasmon<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:25.020> i'm

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
the second plasmon as you can see i'm

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.590 
the second plasmon as you can see i'm
using<00:02:25.620> red<00:02:25.770> dot<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.520> red<00:02:26.730> dot<00:02:27.000> sight<00:02:27.330> guys

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
using red dot the red dot sight guys

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.880 
using red dot the red dot sight guys
yeah<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.170> i<00:02:28.290> said<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.590> my<00:02:28.620> previous

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
yeah like i said in my previous

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.250 
yeah like i said in my previous
commentary<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.570> I've<00:02:30.690> done<00:02:30.810> yesterday<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
commentary the one I've done yesterday I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.930 
commentary the one I've done yesterday I
said<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.770> um<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.280> you're<00:02:32.430> gonna<00:02:32.520> play<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.820> big

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
said that um if you're gonna play on big

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.910 
said that um if you're gonna play on big
maps<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.480> need<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.810> use<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.440> don't<00:02:34.560> need<00:02:34.740> to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
maps you need to use we don't need to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
maps you need to use we don't need to
but<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.360> recommend<00:02:36.480> using<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
but what I would recommend using is a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.860 
but what I would recommend using is a
red<00:02:37.350> dot<00:02:37.500> sight<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:39.240> know<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.510> second

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
red dot sight and you know a second

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
red dot sight and you know a second
attachment<00:02:40.080> could<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> grip<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.190> extended

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
attachment could be grip or extended

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.570 
attachment could be grip or extended
mags<00:02:42.420> or<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.620> even<00:02:43.710> use<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.430> don't

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
mags or you don't even use out you don't

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.950 
mags or you don't even use out you don't
even<00:02:44.670> need<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.000> use<00:02:45.120> two<00:02:45.240> attachments<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.780> can

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
even need to use two attachments you can

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.600 
even need to use two attachments you can
easy<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.200> different<00:02:46.530> proficiency<00:02:47.100> maybe<00:02:47.370> like

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
easy a different proficiency maybe like

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.090 
easy a different proficiency maybe like
kick<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.180> think<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.200> could<00:02:49.320> be<00:02:49.500> pretty<00:02:49.680> good<00:02:49.920> one

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
kick I think it could be pretty good one

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.240 
kick I think it could be pretty good one
like<00:02:50.790> kick<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.360> grip<00:02:51.630> those<00:02:52.110> would<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.800> those

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
like kick and grip those would be those

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.460 
like kick and grip those would be those
would<00:02:53.730> work<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.180> well<00:02:54.330> together<00:02:54.780> guys<00:02:55.140> but

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
would work really well together guys but

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.070 
would work really well together guys but
um<00:02:55.650> yeah<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.430> red<00:02:56.790> dot<00:02:56.940> sights<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.390> big<00:02:57.570> maps<00:02:57.810> I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
um yeah so red dot sights on big maps I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.530 
um yeah so red dot sights on big maps I
think<00:02:58.500> they're<00:02:58.680> important<00:02:59.100> because<00:02:59.540> mostly

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
think they're important because mostly

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.820 
think they're important because mostly
most<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.290> fights<00:03:01.470> are<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.770> be

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
most of your fights are going to be

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.990 
most of your fights are going to be
really<00:03:02.160> really<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.520> know<00:03:02.640> where<00:03:02.820> they're

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
really really you know where they're

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.280 
really really you know where they're
gonna<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.180> far<00:03:03.420> away<00:03:03.510> as<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.260> right

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
gonna be far away as you can see right

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.530 
gonna be far away as you can see right
