00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hi to all of you guys I'm nicola 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:20.550
 brescia and today we're going to unpack the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:23.279
 samsung c300 is double here it is here 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.099
 the samsung monitor 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.619
 let's choose what we should 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.619
 unpack the TV 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:49.400
 but we find its interior this 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.190
 TV consumption information 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.559
 a class b just sucks 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:01.540
 hulk nothing a 24 inch as you can 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:06.680
 note from the writing here consumption 28 watts 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:11.470
 it is these manuals that are useful 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.960
 extreme that I don't know how to do without 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.460
 without them there is as you can see a 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.090
 tilocca cloth that serves to that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.940
 appreciates this case at home should 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.270
 be a lie if not in a correct me 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.680
 if I'm wrong because I'm in a cab 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.810
 names if this could pose use it 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.690
 as monitor mount cable for 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:45.979
 the power supply is obviously the cable 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.080
 jack doubly how many proof they will be 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.000
 the Chinese also stole the batteries 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.860
 then if the remote control 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.430
 because string is never entered 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.430
 questions 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:12.190
 the base here the base feels a smell 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:17.840
 of this is the piece that serves as the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.239
 connection between television and base a 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.480
 those crazy how to see here there is a 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:29.180
 dowry that the team hole site here and times a 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.140
 their pigeon is fine on one side 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:40.209
 as you can see here is the socket 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:43.689
 scart the male audioiq will be connected 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:48.409
 if I'm wrong if you connect the portals 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:52.010
 missed you can also connect the garment 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:55.489
 aux to that felt even though I believe the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 cav hd and I also transmit hatred if not 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.439
 I'm wrong about the rider also transmits 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.419
 was there so here is a simple la 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:08.900
 simple entry for the audio jack 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:14.150
 in case you use a scart socket 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.060
 obviously or 3 contests for see 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.049
 how much can be magnetic 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.750
 this this monitor 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.310
 it would almost come to me by applying the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.549
 magical and those that you put on 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.680
 on the leading displays they animated this 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.199
 film of situations but fire is a 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.629
 little fans and s 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:43.970
 mark and let's connect to the current 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.460
 this television to bring some 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.940
 the excise tax as 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:57.640
 this is how this TV is going 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 to be full hd 24 inches for that 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:08.560
 that I paid it true and 150 euros space 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:13.690
 right here he finished the TV 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:17.410
 nothing is on rai 1 hd and hd has not 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.020
 nothing is ok then there are the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:28.200
 written different entered pardon the light 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:30.760
 nothing I find a TV anyway 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.800
 organized however I believe to the point of 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.960
 graphic view 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:43.930
 also because then with dry even a 40 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.900
 inch from the samsung pro hd is a 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:51.340
 version a bit because it is, however, I noticed 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.660
 that the difference at the same distance 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:05:00.040
 however I find this is better for 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.940
 a use I make of it with respect to use 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.170
 outgoing kitchen that can cover 40 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.750
 inch so I think I hope there is 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.590
 liked this this video I have 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.140
 made of presentation and maybe there 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.590
 everyone had a good day 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.590
 How many
