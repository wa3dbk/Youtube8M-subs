00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
call it test currency so this isn't the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
call it test currency so this isn't the
actual<00:00:25.590> price<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.310> i<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.789> pets<00:00:27.060> like

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

this does verify it and then I don't
know<00:02:22.440> thing<00:02:22.680> goes<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> bags<00:02:23.310> i<00:02:23.700> assume

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
know thing goes to the bags i assume

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.970 
know thing goes to the bags i assume
goes<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.360> mailbox<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.320> password<00:02:25.740> is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
goes to mailbox and the password is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.910 
goes to mailbox and the password is
invalid<00:02:26.640> i<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.090> i<00:02:27.240> didn't<00:02:27.600> long<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> should

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
invalid i but i didn't long so it should

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.670 
invalid i but i didn't long so it should
go<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.210> they<00:02:30.360> go<00:02:30.590> transaction<00:02:31.590> in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
go to the right they go transaction in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.920 
go to the right they go transaction in
progress<00:02:31.710> check<00:02:32.220> back<00:02:32.430> later<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.480> let's<00:02:33.660> see

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
progress check back later so let's see

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
progress check back later so let's see
how<00:02:33.960> long<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.470> takes<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:34.920> my<00:02:34.980> item<00:02:35.370> there

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
how long it takes to get my item there

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.100 
how long it takes to get my item there
it<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:35.880> your<00:02:36.150> item<00:02:36.390> product<00:02:36.930> has<00:02:37.080> been

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it is your item product has been

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.980 
it is your item product has been
delivered<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.180> should<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.510> near<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
delivered so it should be near the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.950 
delivered so it should be near the
millers<00:02:40.320> mailbox<00:02:41.010> no<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> aisle

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
millers mailbox no actually so the aisle

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.240 
millers mailbox no actually so the aisle
actually<00:02:43.290> gets<00:02:43.440> delivered<00:02:43.680> straight<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> your

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
actually gets delivered straight to your

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.310 
actually gets delivered straight to your
bag<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.820> i<00:02:44.880> guess<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.150> provides<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.600> full-time

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
bag so i guess it provides a full-time

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.480 
bag so i guess it provides a full-time
mailbox<00:02:46.710> will<00:02:46.890> choose<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.370> how<00:02:47.430> much

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
used it and it changes into something

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.380 
used it and it changes into something

did<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.790> see<00:03:23.940> how<00:03:24.000> much<00:03:24.150> experience<00:03:24.239> Wii<00:03:24.660> game

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
did it see how much experience Wii game

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.860 
did it see how much experience Wii game
so<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.350> made<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:26.070> pretty<00:03:26.340> good<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.880> i'm

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so I made it it's pretty good so i'm

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.710 
so I made it it's pretty good so i'm
gonna<00:03:28.170> guess<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.620> price<00:03:28.860> i'm<00:03:29.220> gonna<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.720> two

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
gonna guess the price i'm gonna be two

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.199 
gonna guess the price i'm gonna be two
bucks<00:03:31.050> maybe<00:03:31.440> i<00:03:31.860> would<00:03:32.519> soon<00:03:32.820> i<00:03:32.940> mean<00:03:33.090> i<00:03:33.120> think

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
bucks maybe i would soon i mean i think

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
bucks maybe i would soon i mean i think
that<00:03:33.390> would<00:03:33.570> be<00:03:33.660> reasonable<00:03:34.110> because<00:03:34.380> i<00:03:34.620> don't

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
that would be reasonable because i don't

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.560 
that would be reasonable because i don't
know<00:03:35.100> how<00:03:35.310> long<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.760> thing<00:03:35.970> lasts<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
know how long this thing lasts and

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.199 
know how long this thing lasts and
actually<00:03:37.380> i<00:03:37.620> supply<00:03:37.920> testified<00:03:38.550> if<00:03:38.790> i<00:03:38.970> die<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
actually i supply testified if i die and

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.660 
actually i supply testified if i die and
then<00:03:39.570> see<00:03:39.750> what<00:03:39.840> happens<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:40.890> far<00:03:41.160> as<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.430> so

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
then see what happens as far as that so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.940 
then see what happens as far as that so
let's<00:03:41.850> see<00:03:41.940> what

level three so let me check lets us that

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.119 
level three so let me check lets us that
if<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.400> die<00:03:59.459> do<00:03:59.939> I<00:04:00.000> lose<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.450> buff<00:04:01.040> alright<00:04:02.040> so

if I die do I lose the buff alright so
right<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.280> I'm<00:04:02.430> gonna<00:04:02.549> die<00:04:02.730> see<00:04:03.000> if<00:04:03.060> we<00:04:03.150> lose

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
right now I'm gonna die see if we lose

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.569 
right now I'm gonna die see if we lose
it<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:04.409> do<00:04:04.560> not<00:04:04.680> lose<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.040> buff<00:04:05.189> so<00:04:05.430> that

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
it and we do not lose the buff so that

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.459 
it and we do not lose the buff so that
that's<00:04:05.879> good<00:04:06.150> at<00:04:06.239> least<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:06.780> we<00:04:07.049> keep<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.319> hunt

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
that's good at least so we keep a hunt

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.720 
that's good at least so we keep a hunt
experience<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.069> would<00:04:08.310> definitely<00:04:08.340> suggest

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
experience so I would definitely suggest

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.750 
experience so I would definitely suggest
looking<00:04:09.689> up<00:04:09.959> some<00:04:10.170> leveling<00:04:10.530> guides<00:04:10.829> for<00:04:11.579> this
