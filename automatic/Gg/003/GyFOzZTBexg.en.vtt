Hi guys!
Before we begin, what is bunny jumping?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.520
Bunny jump or bhop is a combination of keyboard
strokes and mouse movements used to move faster,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.369
avoid attacks and in some cases to make less
noise.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.039
The sad news is that it's not as effective
as it was in Source (CS:Source) and 1.6 (CS

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.210
1.6).
And the last thing I wanna/want to bring up:

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.340
It's a lot harder to bhop on 64 tick servers
when you compare with 128 tick because it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
less consistent and the jumps are less accurate.
The first rule of bunny jumping is that you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.829
need to bind the jump to something spammable
for when you land e.g. the mouse wheel.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.280
Some people like to scroll up to jump and
some like to scroll down.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.960
This is a personal preference.
To bind scroll up, type this, and for scroll

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.080
down, type this.
You can now jump with scroll.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.240
Try jumping forward with scroll and as soon
as you land make sure to scroll so you instantly

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.920
jump when landing.
Right after your first jump, stop pressing

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.210
forward and let yourself bhop.
This is the very basics of bhop.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.180
Now, type cl_showpos 1.
This will bring up some information in the

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.920
corner and we're gonna focus on velocity.
The velocity is normally on 250 when running.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.060
To effectively bhop, your velocity has to
be between 250 and 300.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.520
You can go faster than 300, but your speed
will be decreased automatically.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.009
So how do we get between 250 and 300?
This is where you need to use the air acceleration

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.049
to your advantage.
How do you do that?

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.740
You do it through strafe movements in the
air.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.049
When moving left in the air with your mouse,
you need to press the A key.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.649
When moving right in the air, you need to
press the D key.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.520
Otherwise, it looks like this.
Here's an example of how you strafe jump left

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.989
in slowmo (slow motion).
Now, look again, but this time look at the

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.029
velocity.
It's over 250.

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:25.109
When you feel comfortable with strafe jumps,
it's time to start practicing bhops.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.219
This time we're gonna strafe out and back
in again, but why?

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:36.689
In order to get speed when bhopping, you need
to move left and right while following a single

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.909
line.
The yellow line shows you which way you wanna/want

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:46.549
to go and the red line shows you how you want
to move in the air to get more speed.

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.959
So here's an example of me bhopping.
I'm trying my best to keep minimum air strafes

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.879
to balance my speed and win extra velocity.
Remember to scroll up or down when landing.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.489
Make sure to practice on places where there's
higher or lower ground, because these little

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.969
height differences will increase your speed
in most cases.

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:15.389
In my opinion a good course for practicing
bhopping is to start from here and to bhop

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.329
all the way to short.
You're allowed to take any route you want

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:28.010
as long as you are using different heights
and still controlling your bhops and speed.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.239
So to summarize all this:
Think about your stafes in the air.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.010
Think about getting the velocity between 250
and 300 for best results.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.019
Remember to follow a single line for more
speed.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:48.049
And remember, also, that it's a lot harder
on 64 tick servers, so e.g. competitive matchmaking.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.180
Keep practicing your strafes and jumps.
And soon you will be able to bunny jump like

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.199
a pro.
Thanks for watching!

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.620
Have an awesome day guys!
