00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
really that good but for the standards

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
really that good but for the standards
that<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> Europa<00:01:49.170> League<00:01:49.290> very

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that we have in Europa League very

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.219 
that we have in Europa League very
decent<00:01:50.159> team<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.049> here

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
decent team but we do get out of here

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740 
decent team but we do get out of here
with<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> draw<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.299> wasn't<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
with a draw and you know it wasn't a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
with a draw and you know it wasn't a
very<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:55.350> hard<00:01:55.680> game<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.159> us<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.430> could<00:01:56.610> have

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
very very hard game for us we could have

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
very very hard game for us we could have
scored<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.990> were<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.350> missed

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
scored but there were all missed

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.280 
scored but there were all missed
opportunities<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.840> Cristiano<00:02:00.840> jr.<00:02:01.170> could

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
opportunities and Cristiano jr. could

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.859 
opportunities and Cristiano jr. could
have<00:02:01.409> done<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.040> game<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.509> still

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
have done a lot this game but we still

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.040 
have done a lot this game but we still
have<00:02:04.619> yet<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> score<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.460> goal<00:02:05.700> or

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
have yet to score a goal or

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.840 
have yet to score a goal or
even<00:02:06.350> getting<00:02:06.590> assists<00:02:06.980> and<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.430> know<00:02:07.580> this

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
even getting assists and you know this

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.570 
even getting assists and you know this
is<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> very<00:02:08.360> very<00:02:08.720> hard<00:02:09.020> league<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.580> hopefully

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
is a very very hard league and hopefully

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.450 
is a very very hard league and hopefully
we<00:02:10.760> qualify<00:02:11.300> for<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.570> Europa<00:02:11.990> League<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.460> we

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
we qualify for the Europa League and we

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.750 
we qualify for the Europa League and we
do<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> 6.5<00:02:14.870> match<00:02:15.290> rating<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.640> know

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
do get a 6.5 match rating and you know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.700 
do get a 6.5 match rating and you know
that's<00:02:17.000> not<00:02:17.150> really<00:02:17.660> that's<00:02:18.050> not<00:02:18.230> really<00:02:18.500> good

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
that's not really that's not really good

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.920 
that's not really that's not really good
for<00:02:18.740> Cristiano<00:02:19.310> jr.<00:02:19.730> but<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.690> know<00:02:20.780> it's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
for Cristiano jr. but you know it's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.870 
for Cristiano jr. but you know it's
better<00:02:21.200> than<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.440> other<00:02:21.650> performances<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.550> had

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
better than the other performances I had

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.750 
better than the other performances I had
in<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.540> previous<00:02:24.050> games<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.070> our<00:02:25.280> next<00:02:25.430> game

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
in the previous games but our next game

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.330 
in the previous games but our next game
is<00:02:25.940> vs<00:02:26.300> académica<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.380> there<00:02:27.740> another<00:02:27.980> team

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
is vs académica and there another team

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.070 
is vs académica and there another team
in<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.880> portuguese<00:02:29.390> league<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.840> we're<00:02:29.960> going

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
in the portuguese league and we're going

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.500 
in the portuguese league and we're going
to<00:02:30.110> be<00:02:30.200> facing<00:02:30.440> them<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.670> were<00:02:31.880> benched<00:02:32.360> we

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
to be facing them but we were benched we

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.180 
to be facing them but we were benched we
weren't<00:02:32.720> even<00:02:32.810> benched<00:02:33.350> we<00:02:33.560> were<00:02:33.740> on<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
weren't even benched we were on the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.950 
weren't even benched we were on the
reserves<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:35.570> because<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
reserves and I think it's because the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.910 
reserves and I think it's because the
manager<00:02:36.170> wants<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.710> put<00:02:36.890> us<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.250> vs<00:02:38.060> FC<00:02:38.990> Midland

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
manager wants to put us in vs FC Midland

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.640 
manager wants to put us in vs FC Midland
for<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> second<00:02:41.180> game<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.840> qualify<00:02:42.350> for<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
for the second game to qualify for the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.220 
for the second game to qualify for the
Europa<00:02:43.040> League<00:02:43.070> but<00:02:43.460> we<00:02:44.210> weren't<00:02:44.450> selected<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
Europa League but we weren't selected to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.950 
Europa League but we weren't selected to
play<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.770> we<00:02:46.580> had<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.910> rely<00:02:47.210> on<00:02:47.240> our<00:02:47.420> team<00:02:47.750> to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
play and we had to rely on our team to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.350 
play and we had to rely on our team to
get<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.410> win<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.250> Cristiano<00:02:49.700> jr.<00:02:50.180> we

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
get the win and with Cristiano jr. we

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.850 
get the win and with Cristiano jr. we
haven't<00:02:50.630> been<00:02:50.690> doing<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.960> well<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.620> team

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
haven't been doing that well in the team

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.070 
haven't been doing that well in the team
so<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.970> think<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.420> switch<00:02:53.690> would<00:02:53.840> have<00:02:53.990> been

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
so I think the switch would have been

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.220 
so I think the switch would have been
well<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.530> that's<00:02:55.460> exactly<00:02:55.760> what<00:02:56.240> happened<00:02:56.630> we

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
well and that's exactly what happened we

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.380 
well and that's exactly what happened we
won<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.590> game<00:02:57.620> three<00:02:58.160> nil<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.940> team

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
won the game three nil and the team

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.600 
won the game three nil and the team
played<00:02:59.750> very<00:03:00.140> well<00:03:00.470> three<00:03:00.890> goals<00:03:01.220> versus<00:03:01.580> a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
played very well three goals versus a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.240 
played very well three goals versus a
very<00:03:01.730> good<00:03:02.300> Portuguese<00:03:02.840> team<00:03:03.080> we<00:03:03.710> do<00:03:03.920> get<00:03:04.130> out

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
very good Portuguese team we do get out

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.040 
very good Portuguese team we do get out
of<00:03:04.340> there<00:03:04.520> with<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.880> win<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.300> we<00:03:05.660> get<00:03:05.840> three

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
of there with the win and we get three

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.410 
of there with the win and we get three
points<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.740> league<00:03:06.920> but<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.580> manager<00:03:07.850> did

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
points in the league but the manager did

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.170 
points in the league but the manager did
decide<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.140> put<00:03:09.650> us<00:03:09.800> back<00:03:10.010> in<00:03:10.070> into<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.000> game

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
decide to put us back in into the game

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.080 
decide to put us back in into the game

that thing's from but their name is very

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.229 
that thing's from but their name is very
hard<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.300> pronounce<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:18.260> Cristiano<00:03:18.950> jr.<00:03:19.459> you

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.790 
hard to pronounce but Cristiano jr. you
know<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.480> team<00:03:20.660> wasn't<00:03:20.840> really<00:03:21.170> relying<00:03:21.530> on

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800

this<00:03:31.040> game<00:03:31.280> was<00:03:31.430> much<00:03:31.670> better<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.239> he<00:03:32.930> did

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
this game was much better and he did

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.650 
this game was much better and he did
have<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.560> lot<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.860> chances<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.700> score<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.330> goal

have a lot of chances to score a goal

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.470 
have a lot of chances to score a goal
but<00:03:36.350> this<00:03:36.770> game<00:03:37.070> did<00:03:37.310> go<00:03:37.520> to<00:03:37.550> extra<00:03:38.000> time<00:03:38.180> and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
but this game did go to extra time and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.020 
but this game did go to extra time and
you<00:03:38.900> know<00:03:39.020> we<00:03:39.200> couldn't<00:03:39.470> really<00:03:40.040> settle<00:03:40.880> this

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
you know we couldn't really settle this

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.479 
you know we couldn't really settle this
in<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.750> full<00:03:41.959> 90<00:03:42.200> minutes<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:43.040> was<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> very

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
in the full 90 minutes it was a very

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.540 
in the full 90 minutes it was a very
hard<00:03:43.640> game<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:45.440> other<00:03:45.650> team<00:03:45.950> had<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.160> very

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
hard game and the other team had a very

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.270 
hard game and the other team had a very
very<00:03:46.880> good<00:03:47.209> astute<00:03:48.020> defense<00:03:48.620> their<00:03:49.070> defense

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
very good astute defense their defense

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.699 
very good astute defense their defense
was<00:03:49.580> very<00:03:50.030> good<00:03:50.390> they<00:03:50.600> were<00:03:50.660> always<00:03:50.989> organized

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
was very good they were always organized

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.440 
was very good they were always organized
and<00:03:51.980> there<00:03:52.340> wasn't<00:03:52.520> much<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.060> we<00:03:53.150> could<00:03:53.300> do

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
and there wasn't much that we could do

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.630 
and there wasn't much that we could do
we<00:03:53.900> did<00:03:54.080> have<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> lot<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.560> opportunities<00:03:55.190> but

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
we did have a lot of opportunities but

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.670 
we did have a lot of opportunities but
their<00:03:55.820> defense<00:03:56.180> was<00:03:56.330> doing<00:03:57.110> all<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.290> job

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
their defense was doing all the job

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.620 
their defense was doing all the job
their<00:03:57.890> goalie<00:03:58.100> didn't<00:03:58.520> make<00:03:58.730> any<00:03:58.940> saves<00:03:59.330> and

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
their goalie didn't make any saves and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.110 
their goalie didn't make any saves and
all<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.680> shots<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.100> Cristiano<00:04:01.550> jr.<00:04:01.970> was

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
all the shots that Cristiano jr. was

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.940 
all the shots that Cristiano jr. was
shooting<00:04:02.480> were<00:04:02.570> off<00:04:02.840> target<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.769> was<00:04:03.890> very

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
shooting were off target so it was very

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.699 
shooting were off target so it was very
bad<00:04:04.400> for<00:04:05.269> Cristiano<00:04:05.600> jr.<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.200> not<00:04:06.380> get<00:04:06.560> these

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
bad for Cristiano jr. to not get these

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.770 
bad for Cristiano jr. to not get these
shots<00:04:06.890> on<00:04:07.130> target<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:08.030> really<00:04:08.390> helps<00:04:08.660> him

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
shots on target that really helps him

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.110 
shots on target that really helps him
out<00:04:08.930> in<00:04:09.170> his<00:04:09.320> men<00:04:09.530> trading<00:04:09.980> but<00:04:10.489> when<00:04:10.850> we<00:04:10.970> have

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
out in his men trading but when we have

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.060 
out in his men trading but when we have
a<00:04:11.150> lot<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.510> chances<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.019> Cristiano<00:04:12.470> jr.<00:04:12.860> just

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
a lot of chances and Cristiano jr. just

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.370 
a lot of chances and Cristiano jr. just
keeps<00:04:13.340> showing<00:04:13.610> them<00:04:13.820> off<00:04:13.970> target<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.660> ruins

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
keeps showing them off target it ruins

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.529 
keeps showing them off target it ruins
