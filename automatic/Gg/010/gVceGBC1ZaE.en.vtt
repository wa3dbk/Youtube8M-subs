separately<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.770> link<00:00:20.160> it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
separately so that I can just link it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
know how to make a Hema curve now I'm

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
know how to make a Hema curve now I'm
trying<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> piece<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
trying to do it here on a piece of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.520 
trying to do it here on a piece of
cotton<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> suppose<00:00:34.350> you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
cotton in the way that I suppose you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.150 
cotton in the way that I suppose you
with<00:00:34.710> regard<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.370> traditional<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:37.040> lots<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
with regard as traditional it's lots of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.810 
with regard as traditional it's lots of
pins<00:00:38.690> very<00:00:39.690> fiddly<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.309> was<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pins very fiddly and if I was going to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.330 
pins very fiddly and if I was going to
be<00:00:41.910> doing<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.450> large<00:00:42.989> amount<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.770> curve<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
be doing a large amount of a curve I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
be doing a large amount of a curve I
think<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> would<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.239> bored<00:00:45.600> very

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
think I would get very bored very

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.520 
think I would get very bored very
quickly<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> yes

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
quickly so yes

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.090 
quickly so yes
gently<00:00:49.530> pins<00:00:50.510> irons<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.899> irons<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.829> friend

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
gently pins irons good irons your friend

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.850 
gently pins irons good irons your friend
and<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> come<00:00:55.350> back<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and then I'm going to come back to that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
and then I'm going to come back to that
okay<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> iron<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
okay I'm going to get the iron out of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:07.420 
okay I'm going to get the iron out of
the<00:00:58.140> way<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> couple<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.920> tricks

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.149 

one<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> them<00:01:09.200> I've<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.560> machine<00:01:10.680> set<00:01:11.100> up

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
one of them I've got my machine set up

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.609 
one of them I've got my machine set up
on<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> running<00:01:11.880> stitch<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:12.900> dark<00:01:13.170> Fred

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
on a running stitch with some dark Fred

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.940 
on a running stitch with some dark Fred
and<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.049> curve<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:18.710> thought<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> had

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and I have a curve here I thought I had

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
and I have a curve here I thought I had
more<00:01:20.189> curves<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.060> I've<00:01:21.810> already

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
more curves than that I've already

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.429 
more curves than that I've already
sliced<00:01:22.439> knocked<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> floor<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.439> what

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
sliced knocked it on the floor and what

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.149 
sliced knocked it on the floor and what
I<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.890> recommend<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> zigzag

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
I would recommend if you have a zigzag

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.730 
I would recommend if you have a zigzag
on<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.610> machine<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:31.079> run<00:01:31.229> around<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
on your machine is to run around the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:52.260 
on your machine is to run around the
edge<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> cloth

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.760 

carefully<00:01:53.270> not<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.659> pull<00:01:53.869> any<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.380> phrase

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
carefully not to pull any of the phrase

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.340 
carefully not to pull any of the phrase
and<00:01:55.450> then<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.780> would<00:01:57.700> allow<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.600> come<00:02:00.049> up

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and then I would allow it to come up

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.940 
and then I would allow it to come up
naturally<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.990> makes<00:02:03.229> sense<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.680> me

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
naturally so it makes sense to me

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.100 
naturally so it makes sense to me
because<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:04.759> got<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.000> natural<00:02:05.300> sort<00:02:05.930> of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
because then it's got a natural sort of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.580 
because then it's got a natural sort of
place<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.979> grip<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:08.149> we<00:02:08.209> all<00:02:08.420> know<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.840> silky

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
place to grip now we all know that silky

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.010 
place to grip now we all know that silky
stuff<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.220> hardest<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.880> sew<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.480> that's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
stuff is the hardest to sew and that's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.990 
stuff is the hardest to sew and that's
why<00:02:12.260> I've<00:02:12.440> chose<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.700> demonstration

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
why I've chose it for this demonstration

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.960 
why I've chose it for this demonstration
so<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.840> got<00:02:18.170> something<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.890> grip<00:02:19.640> onto

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
so it's it's got something to grip onto

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.180 
so it's it's got something to grip onto
now<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.519> then<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:22.820> literally<00:02:23.720> just<00:02:24.590> allow

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
now and then I can literally just allow

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.020 
now and then I can literally just allow
the<00:02:25.250> machine<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.970> take<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:27.400> here<00:02:28.400> inches<00:02:28.820> at<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
the machine to take it here inches at a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.670 
the machine to take it here inches at a
time<00:02:29.060> sorry<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.690> meant<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.959> go<00:02:30.050> back<00:02:30.200> onto<00:02:30.410> one

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
time sorry I meant to go back onto one

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.660 
time sorry I meant to go back onto one
instead<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:33.410> will<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.580> nice<00:02:34.970> curb

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
instead and then it will be a nice curb

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.830 
instead and then it will be a nice curb
okay<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.450> that's<00:02:38.630> one<00:02:38.959> way<00:02:40.150> if<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.540> nice

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
okay so that's one way if it is a nice

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.380 
okay so that's one way if it is a nice
lightweight<00:02:42.260> fabric<00:02:43.100> I'm<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:44.120> going<00:02:44.330> to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
lightweight fabric I'm just going to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.330 
lightweight fabric I'm just going to
borrow<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.750> back<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.500> take<00:02:45.709> out<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> few<00:02:46.100> pins

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
borrow this back and take out a few pins

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.890 
borrow this back and take out a few pins
then<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.940> always<00:02:50.209> use<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:51.110> looper<00:02:51.650> foot

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
it's not very long as input to change

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.280 
it's not very long as input to change
your<00:02:58.880> foot<00:02:59.090> there's<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.450> little<00:02:59.690> catch<00:02:59.959> at<00:03:00.260> the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
want it to be too bulky

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.660 
want it to be too bulky
I'd<00:04:30.260> be<00:04:30.380> too<00:04:30.560> big<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.920> go<00:04:31.040> through<00:04:31.280> anything

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
I'd be too big to go through anything

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.510 
I'd be too big to go through anything
like<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:33.170> let's<00:04:33.380> get<00:04:33.560> rid<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.160> foot

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
like that so let's get rid of that foot

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.020 
like that so let's get rid of that foot
and<00:04:34.760> then<00:04:35.540> let's<00:04:36.200> put<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.710> original<00:04:37.430> foot

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
and then let's put the original foot

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.920 
and then let's put the original foot
back<00:04:38.300> on<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:40.100> this<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:40.640> a<00:04:40.820> standard<00:04:41.150> comes

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
back on so this is just a standard comes

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.190 
back on so this is just a standard comes
with<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.290> machine<00:04:42.620> but<00:04:43.400> in<00:04:43.790> fact<00:04:44.510> my<00:04:44.840> looper

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
with the machine but in fact my looper

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.610 
with the machine but in fact my looper
foot<00:04:45.410> did<00:04:45.650> come<00:04:45.950> with<00:04:46.160> both<00:04:46.400> my<00:04:46.700> machines<00:04:47.620> okay

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
foot did come with both my machines okay

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.370 
foot did come with both my machines okay
so<00:04:49.100> what<00:04:49.250> I'm<00:04:49.370> going<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.580> do<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:50.110> I'm<00:04:51.110> going<00:04:51.169> to

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.970 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
use<00:04:51.440> lining<00:04:52.250> now<00:04:52.790> I'm<00:04:53.169> going<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.350> line<00:04:54.650> up<00:04:54.680> the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
use lining now I'm going to line up the

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.430 
use lining now I'm going to line up the
lining<00:04:55.610> with<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.880> kerb<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.600> then<00:04:56.960> I'm<00:04:57.200> going

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
lining with the kerb and then I'm going

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.640 
lining with the kerb and then I'm going
to<00:04:57.560> pull<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.310> lining<00:04:58.760> across<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.410> can

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
to pull the lining across so that I can

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.940 
to pull the lining across so that I can
then<00:05:00.890> get<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.880> nice<00:05:02.060> curve<00:05:02.510> now<00:05:03.290> depending<00:05:03.830> on
