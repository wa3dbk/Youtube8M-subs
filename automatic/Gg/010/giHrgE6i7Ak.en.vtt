00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.010
 how to make a doll dress for 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.410
 creation we need a fabric which 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 pulling thread and needle let's doll 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.090
 consists of two parts top and bottom 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.390
 which we will then stitch to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.660
 make up the fabric turned the circle 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.900
 dolls and pin here with pins 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.279
 thereafter everyone was pinned together 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
 we have this part of his sacristy 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 pins 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 he needs to cut like this with us 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.780
 This is a rectangle now 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.090
 we can on the doll with a cloth 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 needles and threads we will now sew 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.309
 our fabric stitches and then sew 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.559
 more dense and cameras these are what you with 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.230
 you now do the extra part we 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.750
 cut and why two Circuits more precisely this 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.570
 steel that's what I got I'm one of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.970
 jar and turned out nothing and in such 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.570
 same way we need to make a christmas tree for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 our paid skirt also dock 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 a needle will also take him stitches and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 we cut off the excess part of the credit part 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.740
 It took the form of the navel of Venus 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.070
 skirt we got it now we have these 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 all the tanks will transform the dress 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.020
 further we cut out three rectangles each 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.979
 of which should and more another is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.850
 the smallest 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.909
 this plum is the biggest which 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.909
 equal to the length of the neck of the barrel the following 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.799
 rectangles we just reduce by 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.790
 some centimeters and i 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.829
 just hindered for the hen logicians 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.049
 may be more than the largest 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.630
 rectangle will sew them here 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.750
 this way it looks like this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 the first layer looks like this the second layer 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 look 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 skirt ready to sew the parts together 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:14.310
 short skirt and this is your top boy 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.260
 now you can dry well and that's what I have 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.040
 it turned out like this 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.270
 6 paid she looks and lidia were web 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.459
 then on top I'm still under casale she 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.819
 It turned out a little bit here or otherwise she 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.550
 reached tactics and therefore do not need 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.550

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.590
