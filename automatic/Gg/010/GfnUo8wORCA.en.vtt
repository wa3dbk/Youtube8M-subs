00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 the ceará has a history that does not exist in the personnel you will discover now it has been 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.899
 The incredible writing that the club seeks 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.899
 in the second day 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.380
 a crazy crowd 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.169
 the ceará and 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.779
 vice-leader of series b 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.460
 forty thousand people in the castelão while for the alvinegro to the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.289
 victory 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.289
 rinaldo 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.950
 lifted 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 ansa 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.440
 the signed order 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.340
 four rounds to the end of the championship, the winner was the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.400
 deputy 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.260
 nothing pleasant, ceará has the face of being a leader 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 we are not so intricate spider web numbers impress 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.120
 since 93 the club does not dispute the first division of the Brazilian and yet 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.930
 that year 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.260
 is a series of them passed the ceará mind came to face the main 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 country clubs 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.890
 at that time all eighty-four clubs went through the series b 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.020
 consider it the ceará was the only one that stayed in the second 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.400
 after him the team that is the longest in the b series is the brasiliense 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.470
 I'm 16 years old. 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.260
 the ians agency 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.200
 and a lot of desire 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.410
 better not football at the moment the first dinner will be her grandfather's 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.500
 midfield held around 232 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.579
 7 The team that is about to rise to the first started poorly today 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.700
 it looked like it was going to give flavor 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.899
 the third division in the sixth round was the lantern 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 but the pc team gusmão reacted 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.510
 overtaking everyone 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.110
 in ten rounds later I was already in g4 I do not know well 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.450
 supporters now have a saved may be near the doubles title to the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 side with the dagobert 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.679
 the b-block 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.529
 I hope this measure would be
