and down and the results that you see

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.010 
and down and the results that you see
Marcus<00:01:29.530> getting<00:01:29.890> at<00:01:30.039> those<00:01:30.249> road<00:01:30.579> courses

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
Marcus getting at those road courses

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.539 
Marcus getting at those road courses
aren't<00:01:32.020> because<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.649> team<00:01:32.859> is<00:01:32.890> totally<00:01:33.460> on

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
aren't because the team is totally on

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.249 
aren't because the team is totally on
top<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.850> their<00:01:33.999> cards<00:01:34.390> because<00:01:34.539> Marcus<00:01:35.079> man

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
top of their cards because Marcus man

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.480 
top of their cards because Marcus man
handles<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.649> thing<00:01:35.829> around<00:01:36.009> there<00:01:36.249> and<00:01:36.369> he

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
handles the thing around there and he

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.160 
handles the thing around there and he
knows<00:01:36.670> what<00:01:36.909> he<00:01:36.999> needs<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.270> do<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.719> win<00:01:37.990> races

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
knows what he needs to do to win races

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.919 
knows what he needs to do to win races
on<00:01:38.469> a<00:01:38.499> road<00:01:38.679> course<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.609> you<00:01:40.119> know<00:01:40.390> until<00:01:40.719> they

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
on a road course so you know until they

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.260 
on a road course so you know until they
can<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.710> know<00:01:41.740> maybe<00:01:42.100> find<00:01:42.460> some<00:01:42.639> more<00:01:42.789> some

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
can you know maybe find some more some

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.179 
can you know maybe find some more some
more<00:01:43.299> funding<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.049> really<00:01:44.439> get<00:01:44.619> get<00:01:45.009> that

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
more funding and really get get that

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.730 
more funding and really get get that
team<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.789> guess<00:01:46.299> more<00:01:46.810> towards<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.530> top

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
team I guess more towards that the top

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.230 
team I guess more towards that the top
near<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.069> factory<00:01:48.219> teams<00:01:48.700> it's<00:01:48.939> going<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.149> be

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
near the factory teams it's going to be

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.550 
near the factory teams it's going to be
very<00:01:49.359> very<00:01:49.479> hard<00:01:49.780> for<00:01:49.960> Marcus<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.319> be

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
very very hard for Marcus to be

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.739

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
to his former team boss Ross stone

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.250 
to his former team boss Ross stone
here's<00:03:14.190> what<00:03:14.340> Ross<00:03:14.520> had<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> say<00:03:14.970> yeah<00:03:15.660> well<00:03:15.989> he

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
here's what Ross had to say yeah well he

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.660 
here's what Ross had to say yeah well he
sort<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.560> said<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.890> might<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> make<00:03:17.489> or<00:03:17.610> break
