I<00:02:46.230> don't<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.620> mine<00:02:46.799> hooked<00:02:46.980> up<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.609> for

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
I don't have mine hooked up that's for

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.270 
I don't have mine hooked up that's for
your<00:02:47.910> ebrake<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.620> wouldn't<00:02:49.799> typically

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
your ebrake and you wouldn't typically

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.740 
your ebrake and you wouldn't typically
you<00:02:50.489> would<00:02:50.609> wire<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:51.030> your<00:02:51.239> unit

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
you would wire up your unit

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.790 
you would wire up your unit
to<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.230> ebrake<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:54.300> safety<00:02:54.930> precautions<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
to the ebrake for safety precautions and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.770 
to the ebrake for safety precautions and
then<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.340> would<00:02:56.580> recognize<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.300> I'm

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
then this would recognize it so I'm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.120 
then this would recognize it so I'm
gonna<00:02:57.900> leave<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.740> hit<00:02:58.860> home
