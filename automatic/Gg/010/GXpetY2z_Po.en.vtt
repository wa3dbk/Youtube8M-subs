00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 too old from apartment 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.219
 laundry baskets will change the cover 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.500
 because you are no longer having such baskets 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.820
 100-year-old candle in the sink 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.009
 the gel who hit my sister but I didn't 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.290

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.220
 put a glass on me 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.860
 so here is my casket 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.500

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.840
 I have earrings here which I take off 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.890
 I put the rings there when I wash my soap 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.220

 and I can't stand the towel dryer and 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.770
 but there is nothing to do because somewhere you need 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.180
 dry towels so they had to 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.470
