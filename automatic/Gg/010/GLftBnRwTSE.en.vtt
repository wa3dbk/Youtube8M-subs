80 inches long now I'm not used much of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.130 
80 inches long now I'm not used much of
each<00:01:12.390> fabric<00:01:12.950> because<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.360> come<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.869> close

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
up here to one of them as you can see
there's<00:01:18.540> only<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.049> square<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.799> fabric

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
then only that amount of that one and so

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.330 
then only that amount of that one and so
on<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> I've<00:01:23.369> made<00:01:23.640> four<00:01:24.710> blocks<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:25.979> each

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
on and I've made four blocks from each

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.060

12<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.619> together<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.640> I've<00:01:30.060> used<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.990> fact<00:01:31.380> if

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
12 all together so I've used in fact if

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
color and three two and a half inch

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
color and three two and a half inch
strips<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> darkest<00:01:48.630> color<00:01:48.899> I've

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
strips of the darkest color I've

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.109 
strips of the darkest color I've
obviously<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.640> light<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
obviously got them going from light to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.710 
obviously got them going from light to
dark<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> black<00:01:53.490> strips<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:54.060> only<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
dark the black strips are only one and a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.649 
dark the black strips are only one and a
half<00:01:54.930> inches<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.060> isn't<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> huge

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
half inches and so there isn't a huge

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.569 
half inches and so there isn't a huge
amount<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> I've<00:01:58.590> needed<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.189> less<00:01:59.549> than

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
amount of that I've needed a less than

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.350 
amount of that I've needed a less than
half<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.090> yard<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> entire<00:02:01.530> quilt<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.360> for

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
half a yard for the entire quilt and for

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
half a yard for the entire quilt and for
the<00:02:03.450> white<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:03.960> obviously<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> bulk<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the white which obviously is the bulk of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.080 
the white which obviously is the bulk of
the<00:02:05.460> quilt<00:02:05.700> I've<00:02:06.270> used<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> half<00:02:07.320> yards

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the quilt I've used one and a half yards

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.140 
the quilt I've used one and a half yards
each<00:02:09.090> block<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.720> based<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> half<00:02:10.560> log<00:02:10.920> cabin

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
each block is based on a half log cabin

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.230 
each block is based on a half log cabin
and<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.350> starts<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.640> central

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and it starts with this as the central

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.720 
and it starts with this as the central
block<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:15.690> would<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> half<00:02:16.520> but<00:02:17.520> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
block which would be the half but that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.110 
block which would be the half but that
one<00:02:18.120> stays<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.340> right-hand<00:02:20.340> side<00:02:20.640> because

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
one stays on the right-hand side because

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.870 
one stays on the right-hand side because
we're<00:02:21.330> only<00:02:21.480> adding<00:02:22.020> logs<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.880> three

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
we're only adding logs on the three

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
we're only adding logs on the three
sides<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.450> you'll<00:02:25.110> start<00:02:25.320> with<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.440> two<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.770> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sides so you'll start with the two and a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.260 
sides so you'll start with the two and a
half<00:02:25.980> inch<00:02:26.190> square<00:02:26.550> there<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.060> first

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
half inch square there of the first

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.330 
half inch square there of the first
color<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.960> then<00:02:28.620> above<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.070> there's<00:02:29.280> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
color and then above it there's a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.550 
color and then above it there's a
turn-off<00:02:29.730> inch<00:02:30.060> square<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.900> second<00:02:31.320> color

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
turn-off inch square of the second color

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.500 
turn-off inch square of the second color
a<00:02:31.800> four<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.520> half<00:02:32.550> inch<00:02:32.880> by<00:02:33.030> two<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.360> half

a four and a half inch by two and a half
inch<00:02:33.720> strip<00:02:34.050> down<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> left-hand<00:02:34.860> side<00:02:35.130> and

a half inch strip across the bottom as
you<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.860> see<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> showed<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.880> first

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
you can see I showed that to that first

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.210 
you can see I showed that to that first
and<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.870> showed<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.110> down<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> side<00:02:43.920> and

and then I showed that down the side and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.850 
and then I showed that down the side and
now<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.760> sew<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> one

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
now I can just sew that on this is one

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.470 
now I can just sew that on this is one
of<00:02:46.950> those<00:02:47.070> blocks<00:02:47.340> where<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.090> well<00:02:48.300> worth

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
of those blocks where it is well worth

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.380 
of those blocks where it is well worth
pressing<00:02:49.110> at<00:02:49.350> each<00:02:49.560> stage<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.640> each<00:02:50.940> time<00:02:51.180> I've

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
pressing at each stage so each time I've

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.020 
pressing at each stage so each time I've
done<00:02:51.600> one<00:02:51.660> seam<00:02:52.170> I've<00:02:52.500> left<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.550> iron<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.640 
done one seam I've left the iron on and
I've<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.240> gone<00:02:54.420> across<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.990> pressed<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
I've just gone across and pressed it and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.510 
I've just gone across and pressed it and
the<00:02:56.340> thing<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> lot<00:02:57.330> log-cabin<00:02:57.810> blocks<00:02:58.520> is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
the thing with a lot log-cabin blocks is

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.570 
the thing with a lot log-cabin blocks is
always<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.510> press<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.410> seam<00:03:01.680> allowance<00:03:02.130> away

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
always to press the seam allowance away

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.940 
always to press the seam allowance away
from<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.940> center<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.140> it's<00:03:04.290> being

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
from the center so that it's being

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.830 
from the center so that it's being
pushed<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.400> way<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.180> way<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
pushed that way and then that way and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.710 
pushed that way and then that way and
when<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:08.100> one<00:03:08.340> has<00:03:08.550> gone<00:03:08.700> on<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> bottom<00:03:09.330> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
when this one has gone on the bottom the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.360 
when this one has gone on the bottom the
seam<00:03:09.930> allowance<00:03:10.320> will<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.620> pressed<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.160> way

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
seam allowance will be pressed this way

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.390 
seam allowance will be pressed this way
towards<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.910> bottom<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:13.590> that's<00:03:13.830> color<00:03:14.160> two

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
towards the bottom so that's color two

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
towards the bottom so that's color two
finished<00:03:14.880> now<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.300> gone<00:03:15.450> three<00:03:15.840> sides

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
finished now it's gone three sides

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.699 
finished now it's gone three sides
around<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.739> central<00:03:17.280> square<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:18.350> color<00:03:19.350> three

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
around the central square so color three

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.190 
around the central square so color three
now<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.280> need<00:03:20.610> four<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> half<00:03:21.510> inch<00:03:21.870> strips

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
now I need four and a half inch strips

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470 
now I need four and a half inch strips
across<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.739> top<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:23.850> eight<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.450> half
