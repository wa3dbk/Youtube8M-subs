00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.269
 hello youtube friends as we are already 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.269
 luchita 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.010
 this time I want to teach them to 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.930
 recognize 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.310
 in which this is not certain song the 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.220
 song that they want to know that this does not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.970
 are we going to investigate in these 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 moments ok 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.199
 it is important it is necessary that they lower the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.199
 the best practice program and I explained what 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.360
 in several videos the link or the link 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 to download it and have it 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 installed can change tone 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 any song the song they want 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.290
 for example of some song that is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 in B flat and if we play it here though 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.449
 are the same footprints is still two 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 and you hear ugly then what do we do 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.350
 to move the song to where we are left 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.820
 easy to play in this case for 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.820
 us here is 2 2 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.110
 raisins 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.640
 and when they have downloaded the program 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.720
 they grab a song they want the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.350
 who want to more or less hear 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.010
 truth and they put it to touch 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.990
 Y 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.960
 in the final part of the song as 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.010
 is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.010
 that is to say 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:33.460
 in the final part in the final part of 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 each song how it ends there that is the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.500
 tone where we are ok but to do 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.659
 this we need you to have practice time 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.619
 when they have it they grab the song that 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.840
 they are going to play and they are going to make it repeat 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.240
 the mere in mere mere mere end 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.609
 so that they do as I will finish seeing 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 in this case I do not have pre programmed 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.240
 air list 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.460
 and there ends 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.369
 so what we have to do there already 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.620
 when you put a deposit that if you 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.580
 repeat and repeat repeats is in the part 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.459
 right above where the loop says 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.820
 controls where it says to be that it 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.090
 they put in what minute and that the second 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.220
 they want me to start until what minute and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.620
 what second do you want them to finish for 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.360
 It is repeated that piece I 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.820
 as I told the programs and what 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.830
 I have ready let's find the tone that 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.930
 taking into account that we are 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:46.400
 looking for a finger or kate tone let's see 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:49.880
 let's see see 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.880
 no it is not 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.659
 do not 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.460
 you do not have left 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.320
 for what we do we raise it a half 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.320
 everything to see what happens 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.460
 it did not go very high 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.060
 and we here are down 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.739
 and there is no 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 is very high if we do not upload one more 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.560
 we are higher still true not 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.560
 remains 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.890
 it's not very high you have to lower it 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.140
 then this is the original tone that already 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:49.090
 we saw that it did not fit we are going to lower it 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:49.090
 half tone more to see what means more 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.620
 why 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.130
 to this one 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.700
 good 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.700
 there is 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.540
 good 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.900
 There is then taking into account that 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.300
 we are in two and that is what 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.010
 we go down two semitones true of two and 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.190
 two sharp 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.750
 and then keep saying what you want to say 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.190
 this song is in the network tone 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.660
 but we are going to look for them 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.660
 then 2 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.020
 ok because as it is in a network and we download it 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.450
 two semitones fell to 2 ok in one of the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.490
 videos explain how it goes to all that 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.250
 scale so they know what I'm 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.110
 talking about there but because we are going to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.790
 save again we have to scale 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.720
 with the 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.730
 is complemented with 88 notes that is from me 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.890
 sun has been again are 8 but for 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.840
 make the chromatic scale we go with 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:08.830
 the 22 sharp re re sustained my me no 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:12.849
 has sharp fa f sharp sun 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.339
 I've had it 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.490
 so it also does not have a sharp and 2 and 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:21.610
 Until 12 o'clock that's why if here 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.819
 we finished the king and the song 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.520
 we go down two semitones we go two for 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.099
 up talking two sharp and then 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.920
 follow this song is in the tone of 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.290
 red ok 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.490
 and so his most holy mind can be 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.100
 taking out the tones of each song 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.680
 Greetings to all I leave the link that 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.180
 a necessary agent of the 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.670
 program is due is practice
