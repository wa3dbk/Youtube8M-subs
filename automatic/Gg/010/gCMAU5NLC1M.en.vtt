00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
i wanted to say and I didn't say but I

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.970 
i wanted to say and I didn't say but I
can<00:02:46.139> all<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.099> in<00:02:47.310> segments<00:02:48.019> so<00:02:49.019> I'll<00:02:49.260> film<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
can all do it in segments so I'll film a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.699 
can all do it in segments so I'll film a
segment<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.730> an<00:02:50.879> introduction<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:52.109> maybe

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
segment like an introduction then maybe

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.979 
segment like an introduction then maybe
it<00:02:52.889> dude<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.219> minifigures<00:02:53.849> one<00:02:54.510> at<00:02:54.629> a<00:02:54.750> time

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
it dude the minifigures one at a time

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.300 
it dude the minifigures one at a time
and<00:02:55.290> then<00:02:55.349> do<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.150> main<00:02:57.769> builds<00:02:58.769> at<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.040> set

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and then do the main builds at the set

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.729 
and then do the main builds at the set
and<00:02:59.549> so<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.180> do<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.449> in<00:03:00.540> segments<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.469> and

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
and so I do it in segments like that and

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.990 
and so I do it in segments like that and
that<00:03:01.919> way<00:03:02.069> I<00:03:02.099> can<00:03:02.310> kind<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.549> get<00:03:02.699> my<00:03:02.819> thoughts

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
that way I can kind of get my thoughts

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.539 
that way I can kind of get my thoughts
together<00:03:03.299> before<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:03.989> film<00:03:04.349> if<00:03:04.949> I<00:03:05.129> try<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.340> do

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
together before I film if I try to do

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.189 
together before I film if I try to do
the<00:03:05.669> whole<00:03:05.790> thing<00:03:05.849> just<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.449> one<00:03:06.659> take<00:03:06.900> I'd

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:07.199 
the whole thing just in one take I'd

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.110 
the whole thing just in one take I'd
make<00:03:07.409> even<00:03:07.919> more<00:03:07.949> mistakes<00:03:08.489> than<00:03:08.609> already<00:03:08.939> do

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
make even more mistakes than already do

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.229 
make even more mistakes than already do
but<00:03:09.599> couldn't<00:03:09.959> men<00:03:10.109> bat<00:03:10.379> on<00:03:10.650> backwards<00:03:11.239> so

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
but couldn't men bat on backwards so

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.640 
but couldn't men bat on backwards so
that's<00:03:12.389> a<00:03:12.449> good<00:03:12.480> question<00:03:12.780> let's<00:03:13.139> scroll<00:03:13.379> wait

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
that's a good question let's scroll wait

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.439 
that's a good question let's scroll wait
a<00:03:13.680> minute<00:03:13.859> I<00:03:16.759> don't<00:03:17.759> want<00:03:17.879> ask<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.209> one<00:03:18.329> right
