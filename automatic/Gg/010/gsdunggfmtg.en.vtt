00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello guys today we will draw the young 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.819
 Pikachu 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.180
 to guide us we will start by drawing a 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.759
 circumference and guides the two lines 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.630
 vertical middle line and the middle line 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.630
 horizontal 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.760
 What is love 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.070
 we remodeled the outline in the middle 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.009
 superior of the circumference making it 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.470
 a little more quadrangular and down 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.610
 we will give a more inflated form to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.610
 picacho de picacho 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.160
 for the nose we make a small circle 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.550
 I use the intersection of the two lines 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.160
 half the eyes we will draw them by 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 above the horizontal middle line and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.860
 we will make them slightly separated 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.130
 I will take the mouth laughing I will give it a shape 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130
 triangular 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.040
 the length of the body will be less than 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.130
 of the head about three 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.810
 quarters of this but at the base will be a 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.810
 little wider than the head 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.439
 we make the arms almost straight and with 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.439
 five little fingers 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.729
 only the tips of the 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.100
 little feet we make them thin and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.320
 with two internal divisions for 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.080
 form the three fingers 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.440
 the ears are longer than the arms 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.060
 and the arms come a little below 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.060
 of the middle of the body 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.680
 good before 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.299
 by the severe pose only a part of the 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.000
 tail we will give you the shape as a 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.090
 sort of wider staircase in the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.489
 tip and gradually thinning 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.730
 until you reach the insertion of the tail 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.790
 with a rubber softens the lines of 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.920
 graphite and reviewed the contours with pencil 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.340
 black 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.380
 and now we start coloring I will give them 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.120
 the codes of the colors that are of 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.700
 brand prismacolor the ones I'm using 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.190
 for this drawing so you will have a 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 better notion of how I've been doing 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.800
 combinations of colors for 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 get this effect 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.510
 I follow 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.069
