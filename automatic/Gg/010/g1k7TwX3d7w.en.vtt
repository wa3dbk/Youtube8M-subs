00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Welcome to a new series 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.759
 What does three actually mean? 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 just once a few videos where 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.790
 I attack with a certain tactic 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.139
 just want to show you an attack 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.240
 show before with which units 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 do not want to attack you want to say why 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.490
 and why, why and how I use it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 would like to attack 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.980
 and here you can see i reach in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:30.119
 In this case with 65 level 5 on kobolden 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:31.710
 55 masonry breakers 25.5 giants and 43 but 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.000
 yes the mother was of course extreme 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.280
 I still end up paying dearly in the end 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.809
 such a little time and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.390
 costing and sharing you just 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.190
 how much time and how much do you cost 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 Investing in this army is essential 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.920
 to produce 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.170
 I have no thoughts about it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.399
 makes how many times and when and was not 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.539
 I will upload these videos 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.910
 just in between times and times 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.449
 little if I have the time and lust 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 to try again a new tactic 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.390
 who introduce you because I think so 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.640
 different fighting dog attack tactics 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.129
 are just quite interesting and can 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.049
 you can show it here and yes 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.159
 then let's just jump 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.350
 I would say right in the fight 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.909
 before we stay here forever 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 store around here you can see again 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.610
 my beautiful army is beautiful 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.020
 split that is by the way my second 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.000
 village so do not be surprised because of the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 diamonds that I have there are a few 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020
 I've done it again 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.890
 at least for the fight of the week 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.900
 and the tactics now and then a little bit 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.210
 to produce troops without forever 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 I have to wait a long time for them 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.299
 I chose this opponent here 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 At this point we just do it 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.020
 stopped very briefly or was snappy 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 is've picked out so I think that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.299
 a very good place here we look 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.159
 just a moment 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.899
 I have chosen this now 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.210
 from the bottom left attacking over the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.409
 clear castle because at first I would have 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.640
 I think aborted when I saw 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 had that clear castle units 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.770
 I have come out in this case then 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.350
 not and that's why I'm from below 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 left 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.290
 and yes, as I show it runs the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.570
 sends the giant in front of, so to speak, one 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.459
 So build small tanks that take 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.550
 place I've been around for a while 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.310
 camp around the giants as well 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.069
 use distraction consider me 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.270
 then attack left and right 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.900
 each 1 212 does not know whether it is in the bottom 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.459
 three up two times which one to throw 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.739
 then I have a football in the bottom 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.450
 the top actually in a little too slow 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.430
 and now the kobolde after that is 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 relatively important now are almost the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.060
 complete defense deals 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.380
 to overthrow the giants and now 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.239
 we have been here the mines and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.560
 empty the collector and then we'll look 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.560
 now the two fines are already 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.350
 gone and so on the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.819
 Mineyard Butcher Quest Destroyed Above 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.450
 The giants I have now completely out of the woods 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.940
 Eight left 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.470
 from now on down with the help of vood zaubers 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.030
 and a wall breaker the last time 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.519
 Break the complete double row 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.190
 I have unfortunately cut away 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.870
 the bad luck that here the barbarian king 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.459
 my last riesenbeck baller 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.599
 that's why my coal was now 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.010
 not completely pure 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.160
 Nonetheless, I find that one 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.569
 of course it was interesting tactics 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.830
 not necessarily so successful 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.360
 that problems just that the opponent 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.120
 probably just a little too strong 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.600
 and my giants are not strong yet 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.500
 are enough 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.940
 oh so I have completely forgotten now 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.769
 Of course, I use my barbarous 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.900
 queen still up here the remaining co 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.030
 wanted to cut out and yes unfortunately 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.760
 does not quite work with the 50 percent 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.319
 Nevertheless, a few resources 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.500
 we took with me I find the tactics 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.090
 personally to hunt for cups now 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.829
 stupid sounds but in the cup to hunt one 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.690
 it may be extremely good tactics 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.880
 a few too many giants where I am 25 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.170
 really good a good one 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.670
 Find midfield and, above all, find it 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.569
 I'm the interesting here once kobolde too 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.280
 most would use now 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.420
 But I send archers behind 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.709
 just wanted to do that with kobolden 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.239
 just to try to look the the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.620
 I work here up here 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.900
 again briefly the clear castle thought me 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.459
 maybe I will come a bit more 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.790
 on the 50 percent does not work unfortunately 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.370
 all 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.120
 is not bad either 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.130
 Nonetheless, we'll do it again 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.350
 short stop 102 gold 145,000 elixir and 72 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.510
 dark elixir yes good is not now 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.500
 the best but at least as I said 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.389
 I just want you this one 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.040
 bit after lead 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.459
 so now let's have a look here 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.519
 the time and cost so the giant her 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.430
 can it indeed read every 50 minutes 32.000 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.480
 elixir cost me 32 minutes and 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.740
 five 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.050
 82 x 5 minutes the kobolde the 65 cabbage 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.870
 wanted and 65 elixir costs them with 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.910
 65,000 elixir my good 65,000 yet 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.980
 not 6500 of course and the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.280
 Wall breakers ten minutes and 3000 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.000
 elixir at the magic is exorbitant 180 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.800
 minutes 144,000 elixir so yes the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.110
 mother was the rage server generally the 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.040
 magic really expensive affair so um 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.290
 I put that together 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.300
 for the rows have one hour each 32 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.390
 and 71000 elixir that means we have 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.130
 elixir doubles and 100 gold 1000 gold 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.730
 Plus I would have done the whole thing 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.790
 Interesting 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.440
 Of course, I hope you get that 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.580
 video like it even if the fight 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.240
 I have not had the best one now 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.370
 my, it's a bit like that 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 just to show with what 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.670
 you could still intervene as in this 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.590
 case it just tried this one 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.090
 combination many giants so far 25 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.980
 this with kobolden and not 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.840
 archer or else I was found 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.610
 It is not necessarily so interesting 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.530
 effective as the cow he was then 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.510
 just go to these resources buildings 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.270
 and then somehow such a mixture 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.010
 between the farm and nokia camille is 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.930
 that somehow does not fit all that 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.430
 very well together 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.080
 Well not that way, nonetheless 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.310
 now we are smarter than before 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.890
 I just say yes and if so 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.650
 you liked me then it's me 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.610
 No matter what he does 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.080
 Well, if you're up for more of me 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.570
 then subscribe or let me do it 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.140
 my own nose after I'm out 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.140
 It's good
