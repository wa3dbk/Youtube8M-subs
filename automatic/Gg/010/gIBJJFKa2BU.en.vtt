00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.399
 has a sufficient thickness 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.399
 faith is the first hole 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.970

 shores four kilometers and a half on 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 fishing rod weight is tricky to remove 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:32.550

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.110
 retired from the parking lot for seven 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.560
 kilometers and each of us had just 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.280
 an average of 5-10 perches were caught only 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.760

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.510
 only by four o'clock in the afternoon we approached 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.150
 a small group of fishermen where bite perch 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.830
 was excellent we drilled two or three 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.830
 spoons and started to catch 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:03:07.220

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.650
 immediately upon reaching sleep ashamed after 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.450

 And it happens like we have now 2 teremok having settled 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.540
 a short break in one or two 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.209
 minutes 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.600
 then again two three perch and again 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.570
 break when you attack a good place 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.040
 the light almost everything here is already possible 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.040
 and experiment 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.380
 that is, by catching on a lure on balancers 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.380
 just a simple worm with a hook 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:55.459

00:03:48.480 --> 00:04:03.140
 304 c200 to the heart and the devil falls 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:03.140
