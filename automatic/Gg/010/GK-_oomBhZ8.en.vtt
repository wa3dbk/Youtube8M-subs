I<00:02:33.090> tried<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.780> find<00:02:34.019> out<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> arm<00:02:34.769> see

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
I tried to find out on the arm see

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.750 
I tried to find out on the arm see
website<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.599> couldn't<00:02:37.200> find<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> do

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
website but I couldn't find it what I do

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.210 
website but I couldn't find it what I do
I<00:02:38.880> use<00:02:39.180> phantom<00:02:39.870> power<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.410> don't<00:02:40.739> need

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
I use phantom power so you don't need

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580 
I use phantom power so you don't need
the<00:02:41.819> battery<00:02:42.180> okay<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.080> if<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.290> use<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the battery okay but if you use the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.309 
the battery okay but if you use the
battery<00:02:43.950> with<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.170> mono<00:02:46.349> output<00:02:48.319> when

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
battery with the the mono output when

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.960 
battery with the the mono output when
you<00:02:49.349> plug<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> battery's<00:02:50.370> activated

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
you plug it in the battery's activated

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
you plug it in the battery's activated
so<00:02:51.239> when<00:02:51.660> you're<00:02:51.780> finished<00:02:52.019> played<00:02:52.200> plug<00:02:53.040> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so when you're finished played plug it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.309 
so when you're finished played plug it
out<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:53.670> save<00:02:53.849> every<00:02:54.239> time<00:02:54.510> okay<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.080> why

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
out and you save every time okay so why

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.259 
out and you save every time okay so why
I<00:02:55.349> think<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.980> little<00:02:56.069> I'll<00:02:56.730> contact<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
I think it's a little I'll contact the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.509 
I think it's a little I'll contact the
people<00:02:57.450> at<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.319> Embassy<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.829> see<00:02:58.980> how<00:02:59.130> long<00:02:59.340> it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
people at the Embassy to see how long it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.199 
people at the Embassy to see how long it
will<00:03:00.060> last<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.480> yes<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.410> don't<00:03:01.530> forget<00:03:01.829> to

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
will last but yes you don't forget to

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.339 
will last but yes you don't forget to
block<00:03:03.209> yes<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.950> long<00:03:05.069> time<00:03:05.340> okay

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
block yes it's a long time okay

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.979 
block yes it's a long time okay
can<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.440> make<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> different<00:03:08.099> scale<00:03:08.310> length

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
can you make a different scale length

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.880 
can you make a different scale length
yes<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:11.069> can<00:03:11.459> make<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.579> longer<00:03:12.299> scale<00:03:12.690> length<00:03:12.930> but

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
yes I can make a longer scale length but

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.520 
yes I can make a longer scale length but
not<00:03:14.040> sure<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.690> know<00:03:15.690> for<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
not sure you know for the for the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.289 
not sure you know for the for the
prototype<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.250> use<00:03:17.400> twenty<00:03:17.880> five<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.269> half

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
prototype I use twenty five and a half

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.860 
prototype I use twenty five and a half
inch<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.370> go<00:03:20.519> shorter<00:03:21.000> then<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.660> string

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
inch if you go shorter then the string

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.349 
inch if you go shorter then the string
tension<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.470> even<00:03:22.769> less<00:03:23.120> yes

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
tension is even less yes

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.660 
tension is even less yes
too<00:03:25.079> little<00:03:25.290> string<00:03:25.680> tension<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.430> make<00:03:26.579> it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
too little string tension I can make it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.440 
too little string tension I can make it
a<00:03:26.760> little<00:03:27.090> bit<00:03:27.239> longer<00:03:27.500> like<00:03:28.500> 66<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.489> 67<00:03:29.970> which

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
a little bit longer like 66 or 67 which

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.840 
a little bit longer like 66 or 67 which
is<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.019> cell<00:03:31.260> mer<00:03:31.500> type<00:03:32.250> office

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.789 
rivalling so yeah I can make it
different<00:03:35.150> extreme<00:03:36.150> things<00:03:36.359> longer<00:03:37.079> not

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799

prototypes and and doing research so I'm
sorry<00:03:54.569> no<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:58.170> think<00:03:58.790> no<00:03:59.790> it's<00:03:59.970> it's<00:04:00.599> your

problem<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.700> don't<00:04:05.940> be<00:04:06.090> used<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.450> it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
problem can the don't be used to it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.170 
problem can the don't be used to it
steel<00:04:06.810> strings<00:04:07.230> no<00:04:07.769> absolutely<00:04:08.609> not

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
steel strings no absolutely not

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.319 
steel strings no absolutely not
hey<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.959> made<00:04:10.139> lightweight<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.090> made<00:04:12.090> for

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
hey it's made lightweight and made for

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.180 
hey it's made lightweight and made for
the<00:04:12.419> for<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> lower<00:04:13.320> spring<00:04:13.680> tension

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
the for the lower spring tension

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.009 
the for the lower spring tension
the<00:04:14.340> Nile<00:04:14.520> streets<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.240> think<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.660> really

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
the Nile streets and I think I really

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.360 
the Nile streets and I think I really
think<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.739> would<00:04:16.920> string<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.280> up

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
think that if you would string it up

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.789 
think that if you would string it up
with<00:04:17.549> steel<00:04:17.790> strings<00:04:18.410> probably<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.560> top

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
with steel strings probably the top

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.910 
with steel strings probably the top
would<00:04:20.010> collapse<00:04:20.910> or<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.600> would<00:04:21.780> not<00:04:21.959> be<00:04:22.770> able

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
would collapse or it would not be able

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.220 
would collapse or it would not be able
to<00:04:23.130> take<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.520> stress<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.030> no<00:04:24.540> please

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
to take the stress so no please

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.490 
to take the stress so no please
no<00:04:25.680> steel<00:04:26.010> serving<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> dome<00:04:26.930> okay<00:04:28.140> well

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
no steel serving of the dome okay well

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.100 
no steel serving of the dome okay well
then<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> last<00:04:28.950> question<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.510> dome<00:04:30.690> only

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
then the last question is the dome only

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.720 
then the last question is the dome only
