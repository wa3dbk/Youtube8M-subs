so<00:00:00.810> it's<00:00:01.020> time<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.260> add<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.589> little<00:00:01.860> bit<00:00:02.220> of

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so it's time to add a little bit of

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.599 
so it's time to add a little bit of
space<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.270> soiree<00:00:04.259> beehives<00:00:04.799> now<00:00:05.130> it's<00:00:05.430> a

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
space to the soiree beehives now it's a

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.970 
space to the soiree beehives now it's a
process<00:00:06.060> called<00:00:06.240> no<00:00:06.540> Deering<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
process called no Deering and the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.730 
process called no Deering and the
Deering<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.550> basically<00:00:09.090> where<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.960> lift<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
Deering is basically where you lift the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.620 
Deering is basically where you lift the
entire<00:00:10.860> hive<00:00:11.309> up<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.820> add<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> box<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
entire hive up and you add a box on the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.700 
entire hive up and you add a box on the
bottom<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.040> opposite<00:00:15.109> from<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.590> way

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
bottom so it's the opposite from the way

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.230 
bottom so it's the opposite from the way
you<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> length<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.699> hive<00:00:17.910> where

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you do it with a length of hive where

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.269 
you do it with a length of hive where
they<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.230> beauties<00:00:19.590> build<00:00:19.920> from<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.260> bottom

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
they the beauties build from the bottom

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.220 
they the beauties build from the bottom
up<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.430> leVoir<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> pie<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:24.750> build<00:00:24.930> from<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
up and leVoir a pie they build from the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.189 
up and leVoir a pie they build from the
top<00:00:25.410> down<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.180> my<00:00:27.330> bottom<00:00:27.689> box<00:00:27.900> here

top down so this is my bottom box here

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
top down so this is my bottom box here
and<00:00:28.289> they're<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.949> crowded<00:00:29.939> down<00:00:30.420> there<00:00:30.449> in

the bottom you see the new comb this is
the<00:00:33.930> upper<00:00:34.170> box<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.800> one's<00:00:34.980> totally

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

filled and if you take take a look

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.310 
filled and if you take take a look
around<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.090> front<00:00:40.340> they're<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.610> completely

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
around the front they're just completely

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
around the front they're just completely
streaming<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> front<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.390> little

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
streaming out of the front a little

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.750 
streaming out of the front a little
concern<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.050> might<00:00:46.289> try<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> swarm<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
concern they might try to swarm just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
concern they might try to swarm just
because<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.620> rut<00:00:49.620> they're<00:00:49.829> running<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
because their rut they're running out of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
because their rut they're running out of
space<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> go<00:00:52.050> ahead<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.440> try

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
space so I'm going to go ahead and try

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
space so I'm going to go ahead and try
to<00:00:53.460> lift<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> whole<00:00:53.969> thing<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> we

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to lift the whole thing up and so we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.689 
to lift the whole thing up and so we
went<00:00:56.100> ahead<00:00:56.190> took<00:00:56.610> off<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.920> roof<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.579> see

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
went ahead took off the roof you can see

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
went ahead took off the roof you can see
the<00:00:59.789> roof<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> second

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the roof there and then the the second

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
the roof there and then the the second
box<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:03.180> box<00:01:03.449> which<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
box or the first box which is just a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.080 
box or the first box which is just a
feeder<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.280> haven't<00:01:05.549> used<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.000> I've

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
feeder which I haven't used but I've

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
feeder which I haven't used but I've
left<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> feeder<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.470> sure

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
left the feeder in because I'm not sure

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
left the feeder in because I'm not sure
hoping<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:08.820> won't<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.330> fed

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hoping that they won't have to be fed

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.560 
hoping that they won't have to be fed
but<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> case<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.479> this

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but just in case they do so at this

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
but just in case they do so at this
point<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.990> I'll<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.650> lift<00:01:13.860> up

down or now is it even on there I got a
little<00:03:41.720> bit<00:03:47.050> yeah<00:03:48.050> well<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:48.860> flush<00:03:49.130> with<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
little bit yeah well it's flush with the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.020 
little bit yeah well it's flush with the
front<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:52.150> all<00:03:53.150> right<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.640> wasn't<00:03:55.820> too

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
front so all right so I wasn't too

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.470 
front so all right so I wasn't too
terrible<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:57.520> little<00:03:58.520> bit<00:03:58.670> yeah<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.150> was<00:03:59.300> that

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
terrible a little bit yeah that was that

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.240 
terrible a little bit yeah that was that
was<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.810> worst<00:03:59.990> part<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.560> think<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.860> key<00:04:01.070> is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
was the worst part so I think the key is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.710 
was the worst part so I think the key is
not<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.670> let<00:04:01.820> them<00:04:01.910> get<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.300> point<00:04:02.600> when

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
not to let them get to that point when

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.360 
not to let them get to that point when
you're<00:04:02.810> going<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.020> do<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.320> we're<00:04:04.220> going<00:04:04.310> to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
you're going to do that we're going to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.590 
you're going to do that we're going to
do<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.580> other<00:04:04.760> one<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.180> think<00:04:05.240> it's<00:04:05.480> going

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
do this other one and I think it's going

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.510 
do this other one and I think it's going
to<00:04:05.660> be<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.110> lot<00:04:06.470> easier<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:10.160> Sajha<00:04:11.000> can't<00:04:11.300> all
