00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
what it looks like so let's get started

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.630 
what it looks like so let's get started
I'll<00:00:18.660> start<00:00:18.960> off<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.350> bottom<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.039> work

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
I'll start off with the bottom and work

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.660 
I'll start off with the bottom and work
my<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:21.619> but<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.859> two<00:00:23.010> new<00:00:23.160> substrates

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
my way up but the two new substrates

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.589 
my way up but the two new substrates
that<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.880> picked<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.330> our<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.269> potting

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that I picked up our is not just potting

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.859 
that I picked up our is not just potting
soil<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.220> underwater<00:00:29.220> salt<00:00:30.060> water<00:00:30.240> salt

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
soil it's underwater salt water salt

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
soil it's underwater salt water salt
water<00:00:31.050> soil<00:00:31.279> I'm<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.369> sure<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.850> called

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
water soil I'm not sure what it's called

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.950 
water soil I'm not sure what it's called
but<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> brand<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.930> nature's<00:00:34.410> ocean<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
but the brand is nature's ocean and it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.770 
but the brand is nature's ocean and it
keeps<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> pH<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.190> water<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> constant

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
keeps the pH of the water at a constant

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.139 
keeps the pH of the water at a constant
8829<00:00:40.790> which<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.120> good<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.820> as<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.120> as

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
8829 which is really good and as well as

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.069 
8829 which is really good and as well as
the<00:00:45.450> oxygen<00:00:45.930> level<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.610> others<00:00:48.149> essential

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the oxygen level and others essential

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.639 
the oxygen level and others essential
elements<00:00:49.500> needed<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> tank<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:52.500> other

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
elements needed in the tank the other

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.779 
elements needed in the tank the other
substrate<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> natural<00:00:54.149> ocean<00:00:55.370> sand<00:00:56.370> gravel

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
substrate is a natural ocean sand gravel

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.200 
substrate is a natural ocean sand gravel
and<00:00:57.210> seashell<00:00:57.719> mixture<00:00:58.430> that<00:00:59.430> keeps<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> pH

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and seashell mixture that keeps the pH

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.310 
and seashell mixture that keeps the pH
level<00:01:00.239> data<00:01:00.870> 89<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.980> well<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:03.840> helps<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
level data 89 as well and it helps the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.120 
level data 89 as well and it helps the
the<00:01:04.920> plants<00:01:05.250> grow<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.820> well<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.740> think

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the plants grow more as well so I think

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.350 
the plants grow more as well so I think
the<00:01:08.580> combination<00:01:08.820> works<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:11.119> as<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the combination works really good as you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.000 
the combination works really good as you
can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> picked<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.320> bunch<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.680> live

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
can see I picked up a bunch of live

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.499 
can see I picked up a bunch of live
plants<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> tank<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.259> turtle<00:01:17.240> can't<00:01:18.240> eat

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
plants in the tank the turtle can't eat

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.030 
plants in the tank the turtle can't eat
these<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.990> haven't<00:01:19.320> put<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.799> yet<00:01:20.009> so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
there and one over there they're being

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.080 
there and one over there they're being
anchored<00:01:47.229> down<00:01:47.650> underwater<00:01:48.160> with<00:01:49.060> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
anchored down underwater with the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.160 
anchored down underwater with the
fishing<00:01:49.600> line<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:52.060> way<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.780> right<00:01:52.960> there

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
fishing line and the way is right there

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.450 
fishing line and the way is right there
in<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.320> sand<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:59.200> water<00:01:59.470> should<00:01:59.590> be<00:01:59.950> at<00:02:00.310> an

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
in the sand the water should be at an

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.010 
in the sand the water should be at an
eight<00:02:00.670> nine<00:02:00.940> but<00:02:01.180> i'll<00:02:01.270> check<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.720> right<00:02:01.840> after

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
eight nine but i'll check it right after

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.560 
eight nine but i'll check it right after
this<00:02:02.259> video<00:02:02.500> i<00:02:04.950> also<00:02:05.950> picks<00:02:06.250> up<00:02:06.570> marine

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
this video i also picks up marine

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.930 
this video i also picks up marine
stabilizer<00:02:08.170> right<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:08.800> which<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.490> good<00:02:09.729> for

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
stabilizer right here which is good for

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.320 
stabilizer right here which is good for
the<00:02:09.970> ph<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:12.310> alkalinity<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.150> water

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the ph and the alkalinity of the water

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.780 
the ph and the alkalinity of the water
is<00:02:14.050> called<00:02:14.380> instant<00:02:14.950> ocean<00:02:15.370> marine

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
is called instant ocean marine

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.110 
is called instant ocean marine
stabilizer<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.570> you're<00:02:16.690> interested<00:02:17.700> i<00:02:18.700> also

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
stabilizer if you're interested i also

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
stabilizer if you're interested i also

it's good to go i also got this 3-pack
of<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:38.200> camp<00:02:38.680> marine<00:02:39.900> probe<00:02:40.900> upper<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
of the camp marine probe upper the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.479 
of the camp marine probe upper the
chrome<00:02:43.060> amino<00:02:43.390> acids<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.489> essential

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
chrome amino acids and essential

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.840 
chrome amino acids and essential
elements<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.900> buffer<00:02:50.290> keeps<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.980> ph

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
elements so on the buffer keeps the ph

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.930 
elements so on the buffer keeps the ph
at<00:02:52.030> an<00:02:52.150> 8.3<00:02:52.930> which<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.250> tank<00:02:54.489> should<00:02:54.670> be<00:02:54.730> at

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
at an 8.3 which the tank should be at

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.880 
at an 8.3 which the tank should be at
nine<00:02:55.209> right<00:02:55.420> now<00:02:56.280> for<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.340> plants<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.890> i'll

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
nine right now for the plants so i'll

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.039 
nine right now for the plants so i'll
check<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.579> little<00:03:00.970> after<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.840> video

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
up the zoo med large basking spot turtle

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.229 
up the zoo med large basking spot turtle
dog<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:12.489> box<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.850> right<00:03:13.000> over<00:03:13.120> here

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.209 

but<00:03:17.239> all<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.079> time<00:03:18.319> I've<00:03:18.530> been<00:03:18.560> using<00:03:18.920> this

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
but all this time I've been using this

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.289 
but all this time I've been using this
Center<00:03:19.879> glass<00:03:20.150> piece<00:03:20.450> I've<00:03:20.900> been<00:03:21.170> getting<00:03:21.469> a

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
Center glass piece I've been getting a

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.879 
Center glass piece I've been getting a
hate<00:03:23.299> comments<00:03:23.599> on<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.590> turtle<00:03:24.769> is

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
hate comments on this like the turtle is

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.149 
hate comments on this like the turtle is
going<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.099> fall<00:03:25.310> off<00:03:25.340> or<00:03:26.379> what<00:03:27.379> she<00:03:27.530> hasn't<00:03:27.980> yet

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
going to fall off or what she hasn't yet

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.330 
going to fall off or what she hasn't yet
but<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.329> just<00:03:29.450> don't<00:03:29.569> want<00:03:29.749> to<00:03:29.780> take<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> chance

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
but I just don't want to take a chance

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.580 
but I just don't want to take a chance
so<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.609> mean<00:03:31.819> I<00:03:31.849> picked<00:03:32.120> up<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:32.560> basking<00:03:33.560> spot

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
so I mean I picked up this basking spot

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.890 
so I mean I picked up this basking spot
doc<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.849> think<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.090> looks<00:03:35.120> really<00:03:35.389> good<00:03:35.629> its

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
doc and I think it looks really good its

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.410 
doc and I think it looks really good its
natural<00:03:36.409> looking<00:03:36.790> way<00:03:37.790> better<00:03:37.819> than<00:03:38.269> the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
natural looking way better than the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.330 
natural looking way better than the
center<00:03:38.719> glass<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.439> i<00:03:39.469> might<00:03:39.799> just<00:03:39.829> remove

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
center glass be so i might just remove

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.920 
center glass be so i might just remove
this<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.950> keeps<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.569> temperature<00:03:44.569> high

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
this and it keeps the temperature high

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.000 
this and it keeps the temperature high
or<00:03:44.989> two<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.680> i<00:03:48.760> also<00:03:49.760> picked<00:03:50.000> up<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:51.230> new<00:03:51.560> box<00:03:51.799> of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
or two so i also picked up a new box of

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.300 
or two so i also picked up a new box of
carbon<00:03:52.549> for<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.879> filter<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.780> just<00:03:54.590> ran<00:03:54.889> it

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
carbon for the filter so I just ran it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.800 
carbon for the filter so I just ran it
through<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.609> filter<00:03:55.939> and<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.329> water<00:03:56.540> already

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
through the filter and the water already

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.129 
through the filter and the water already
looks<00:03:57.079> much<00:03:57.290> better<00:03:59.409> so<00:04:00.409> that's<00:04:00.620> good<00:04:02.049> let<00:04:03.049> me

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
looks much better so that's good let me

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.869 
looks much better so that's good let me
just<00:04:03.319> check<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.769> pH<00:04:04.189> for<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.549> guys<00:04:04.669> real

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
just check the pH for you guys real

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:14.470 
just check the pH for you guys real
quick<00:04:05.859> show<00:04:06.859> you<00:04:06.919> how<00:04:07.099> this<00:04:07.280> thing<00:04:07.489> works<00:04:13.480> yep

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
quick show you how this thing works yep

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
as you can see the ph is at nine point

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.080 
as you can see the ph is at nine point
12<00:04:17.509> and<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.989> temperature<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.859> 75<00:04:21.699> which<00:04:22.699> is

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
12 and the temperature is 75 which is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.120 
12 and the temperature is 75 which is
really<00:04:23.360> good<00:04:23.570> with<00:04:23.810> i<00:04:24.139> was<00:04:24.380> trying<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.770> get<00:04:24.949> it
