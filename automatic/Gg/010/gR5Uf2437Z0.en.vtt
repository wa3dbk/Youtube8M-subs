00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.670
 university actors since they sport 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.670
 but territory 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.160
 it was for everyone the same 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.720
 already had a departure that was shifted because 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.930
 so it was raining so cool a 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.850
 little we ran there were lightning and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.770
 the storm that rumbled after that is 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.330
 it was a bit everyone I think 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.489
 the rain today there is no one 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.059
 who will escape bad 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.580
 terms 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.840
 after these recurrences that we also have 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.180
 difficult conditions so that's true 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 it's a good workout 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.400
 a good workout so for steve rcd 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.590
 exercise which are very very very hard 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.570
 violent and it's still very tight and 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.760
 beat a little normal over distances 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.710
 we're going for short misses I thought well 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.220
 that you preferred at the level of 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.220
 results 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.840
 good the bag finally me I knew it had 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.780
 qualified that it's going to be really tight 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.229
 so as it's a really format 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.900
 short that we really had to give everything 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.070
 until the end and with the rain knew 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.950
 that slowed down a little 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.530
 so we still had to put the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 double bites but very happy 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 of today yes 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.340
 yeah that's right it's never easy 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.320
 it's a prologue saicourt always needs 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.509
 to be a little in rhythm with the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.280
 conditions in addition today it was 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.049
 not obvious ch with anyway that 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.409
 was going to be playing for nothing so I have nothing 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.390
 loose 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.459
 it smiled more at home I am 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.500
 great to be happy with the wind 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.400
 Robin who was hoping to win today 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.489
 as a type of the year 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.870
 so that's really fun 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.920
 I was expecting I was not sure what to expect 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.560
 wait for me after it's true that it's a 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
 format that succeeds me very well that that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.400
 I love that I love and that it is 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.900
 for me it was a little test of the summer 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.209
 even to validate a little bit everything 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.340
 training a view so ultimately 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.590
 good feelings I regret a little bit of 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.110
 do not have not won after good 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.910
 it's not that it changed not much 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.340
 in life especially it would change in view 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.810
 of winter it's cyril good bah I know 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.390
 that he is very strong on prologues 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.750
 also and here at home today he 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.170
 so 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.549
 so that's fine now it will be 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.980
 tomorrow and it's not having a second 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.870
 before starting tomorrow and who will 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.430
 really everything changed will take 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.680
 good tomorrow so almost always better 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.090
 to leave in front of that behind that is going to be 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.489
 it's going to be a nice battle I think 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.160
 that there must be no big gap 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.500
 today I have not seen but we will 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
 find a good little group and if they 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.970
 manage this climb better we will see 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 it'll be the one that will be the coolest 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.750
 physically after those two weeks of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.340
 stage and then and so here I hope 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.530
 I hope to defend my title this 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.500
 would be nice but but good 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.940
 it's if it's not this year 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.930
 I hope it will be for another 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.329
 year and then we 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.290
 after we know that the others to 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.290
 goals are for this winter 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.980
