00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.240
 well I send on the fly just bought this 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.210
 anti puncture liquid for the quotas of the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.590
 need the car though for the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.199
 bicycle he bought it, and it says 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 slime then the brand remains and let's go to 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.689
 see the thing that pleases me 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.580
 surprised that opening today 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 a mouthpiece ready to be 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.939
 squeezed ok so I press I have to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.939
 first have probably here 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.950
 so I have to remove the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.710
 then simply plug pro 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.870
 pressing the liquid will come out and the thing 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 very pretty that solves a problem 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 of the syringe and that already included a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 little tube see the bottle shop this 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.920
 form 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.719
 here they have already put a tube and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.430
 so there is no need to spend money 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.920
 for the syringe then I put his own 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.399
 near here the tube on the chamber 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 air is simply certain that there is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.619
 I throw in here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.060
 we see that here they have left free 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.580
 free here to see the level of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.979
 how much it goes down so one could too 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.610
 say look this is the goal you see 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.909
 this year put 237 milliliters then 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 this is half the bottle that's okay 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.810
 you know you are doing two wheels of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 bicycle also also four wheels with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.119
 44 and 48 of the bikes you can do yes 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.549
 because usually the dose I was one 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.400
 bicycle is 60 a normal dose 60 ml 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.130
 let's see if something is written 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.720
 then for motorcycles 237 then 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.040
 this serves for two wheels of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.790
 motorbike for the scooter and 237 for i 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.700
 carts machines 430 15 make one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 car wheel and instead for the bike 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.340
 because it's OK to beautiful beach 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 surely it will be like nothing 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.099
 after which I take this off I got it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.239
 I pick up again, I got a lot 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.640
 comfortable 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.680
 this is nice even from 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.750
 even in the car in the car if a guga 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.050
 simply throw us in this e 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.280
 then swell the wheel that is enough for it 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.100
 one of those machines to inflate it 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 wheel then does a bit of m because the rose 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.920
 some verse movement before the rose 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.570
 then he repairs it with just a few euros 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.160
 at the moment it works it doesn't work I don't know 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.380
 because I've never tried this bank 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.230
 slime, however, seeing that the name 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.970
 foreigner neither from the idea that ed 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.770
 import generally if one thing does not 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.410
 it works, they don't even export it 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.930
 they give the only damage to those of the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.950
 place and then just a thousand civilians has 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.870
 said that it works 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.160
 the ten dini said it works 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.160
 because it is an xenophile
