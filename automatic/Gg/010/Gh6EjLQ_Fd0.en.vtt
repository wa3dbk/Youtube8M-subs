especially smaller river and the only
cast<00:00:50.710> they<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:51.070> do<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> overhead<00:00:51.850> cast

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.430 

obviously<00:00:55.239> one<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.540> basic<00:00:55.899> cast<00:00:56.170> and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
obviously one of the basic cast and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.810 
obviously one of the basic cast and
everybody<00:00:56.800> needs<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.040> learn<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.640> want

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
everybody needs to learn it but you want

everybody needs to learn it but you want
to<00:01:00.940> be<00:01:01.030> able<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.239> do<00:01:01.390> raw<00:01:01.570> cast<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.710> lot<00:01:02.950> of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
to be able to do raw cast a lot of

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.219 
to be able to do raw cast a lot of
rivers<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.270> you<00:01:04.420> can<00:01:04.570> see<00:01:04.780> here<00:01:05.050> they've<00:01:05.199> got

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
rivers and you can see here they've got

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.260 
rivers and you can see here they've got
banks<00:01:05.770> Alden<00:01:06.750> trees<00:01:07.750> all<00:01:08.020> doing<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.350> banks<00:01:09.270> or

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
vegetation and if you're doing overhead

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.120 
vegetation and if you're doing overhead
cast<00:01:14.860> you're<00:01:15.580> gonna<00:01:15.700> catch<00:01:16.000> them<00:01:16.410> so<00:01:17.410> really

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
cast you're gonna catch them so really

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.770 
cast you're gonna catch them so really
important<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.640> learn<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:19.060> roll<00:01:19.390> cast<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
important to learn a roll cast and the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.139 
important to learn a roll cast and the
roll<00:01:22.990> casters<00:01:23.590> when<00:01:24.490> we're<00:01:24.610> doing<00:01:24.729> overhead

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
roll casters when we're doing overhead

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.449 
roll casters when we're doing overhead
we<00:01:25.330> left<00:01:25.539> celery<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:26.470> one<00:01:26.679> pause<00:01:27.069> and

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
we left celery to one pause and

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.650 
we left celery to one pause and
accelerate<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.090> Ted<00:01:28.709> nice<00:01:29.709> and<00:01:29.920> simple<00:01:30.660> celery

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
accelerate to Ted nice and simple celery

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.370 
accelerate to Ted nice and simple celery
to<00:01:31.840> one<00:01:32.080> pause<00:01:32.560> facility<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.459> ten<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
to one pause facility to ten the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380 
to one pause facility to ten the
difference<00:01:35.770> with<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.950> roll<00:01:36.099> cast<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.670> that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
difference with the roll cast is that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.130 
difference with the roll cast is that
we'll<00:01:37.630> keep<00:01:38.380> an<00:01:38.530> out<00:01:38.679> laying<00:01:38.860> on<00:01:39.069> the<00:01:39.160> water<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
we'll keep an out laying on the water to

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.230 
we'll keep an out laying on the water to
the<00:01:41.259> left<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.920> draw<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.190> back<00:01:42.399> there's<00:01:43.030> an

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
the left we draw it back there's an

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.660 
the left we draw it back there's an
anchor<00:01:43.360> point<00:01:43.539> in<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.869> water<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.800> we

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
anchor point in the water and we

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.020 
anchor point in the water and we
accelerate<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.390> ten<00:01:46.569> o'clock<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.610> just<00:01:48.819> means

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
accelerate to ten o'clock it just means

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.270 
accelerate to ten o'clock it just means
we<00:01:49.179> can<00:01:49.330> get<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.569> fly<00:01:49.899> across<00:01:50.280> without

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
we can get that fly across without

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.219 
we can get that fly across without
worrying<00:01:51.759> a<00:01:51.849> bit<00:01:51.880> catching<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.780> trees<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
worrying a bit catching the trees of the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.570 
worrying a bit catching the trees of the
bone<00:01:53.410> behind<00:01:53.619> us<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.530> these<00:01:56.920> casts<00:01:57.429> that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
bone behind us and these casts that

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.040 
bone behind us and these casts that
we're<00:01:57.700> doing<00:01:57.880> these<00:01:58.119> raw<00:01:58.360> casts<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:58.929> do

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
we're doing these raw casts that we do

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.960 
we're doing these raw casts that we do
with<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.229> single<00:01:59.440> hand<00:01:59.649> single<00:02:00.580> handed<00:02:00.819> rod

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
with a single hand single handed rod

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.900 
with a single hand single handed rod
they'll<00:02:01.840> basically<00:02:02.050> lead<00:02:02.470> us<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.920> fishing

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
they'll basically lead us in a fishing

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.490 
they'll basically lead us in a fishing
with<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.060> double<00:02:04.330> handle<00:02:04.630> rod<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.349> get

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
with a double handle rod you can get

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.199 
with a double handle rod you can get
comfortable<00:02:05.770> with<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.130> roll<00:02:06.399> cast<00:02:06.670> like<00:02:07.000> that

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
comfortable with a roll cast like that

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.260 
comfortable with a roll cast like that
and<00:02:07.780> then<00:02:08.530> developer<00:02:09.099> into<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.550> which<00:02:10.119> is

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and then developer into this which is

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.309 
and then developer into this which is
effectively<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.869> single-speed<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:13.319> you're

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
effectively a single-speed then you're

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.780 
effectively a single-speed then you're
going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.650> able<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.830> transfer<00:02:15.370> very<00:02:15.550> easily

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
going to be able to transfer very easily

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.610 
going to be able to transfer very easily
in<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.120> double<00:02:16.420> handed<00:02:16.690> custom<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.260> salmon

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.780 
in a double handed custom of the salmon
rod<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> if<00:02:19.690> we<00:02:19.930> were<00:02:20.020> approaching<00:02:20.380> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
rod so if we were approaching this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.250 
rod so if we were approaching this
thinking<00:02:21.790> about<00:02:21.970> trailer<00:02:22.270> grill<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.810> fishing

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260

a single Memphis

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.540 
a single Memphis
we'd<00:02:24.790> start<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.420> head<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.260> pool<00:02:26.500> fast<00:02:27.160> water

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
we'd start a head of a pool fast water

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.920 
we'd start a head of a pool fast water
it's<00:02:27.790> where<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.060> fish<00:02:28.239> loyalty<00:02:28.689> to<00:02:28.810> be

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
it's where the fish loyalty to be

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.110 
it's where the fish loyalty to be
especially<00:02:29.439> in<00:02:29.500> law<00:02:29.650> conditions<00:02:30.189> and<00:02:31.030> we're

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
especially in law conditions and we're

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.610 
especially in law conditions and we're
going<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.329> want<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.510> put<00:02:31.719> that<00:02:31.870> fly<00:02:32.200> across<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
going to want to put that fly across the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.869 
going to want to put that fly across the
stream

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
stream

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.170 
stream
I'll<00:02:34.689> let<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.900> swing<00:02:35.799> round<00:02:36.040> naturally<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I'll let it swing round naturally and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.119 
I'll let it swing round naturally and
unlike<00:02:40.569> salmon<00:02:41.049> fishing<00:02:41.439> you<00:02:41.799> want<00:02:41.980> your

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
unlike salmon fishing you want your

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.849 
unlike salmon fishing you want your
finger<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.639> lane<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.439> soon<00:02:44.620> as<00:02:44.739> you

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
finger on the lane and as soon as you

finger on the lane and as soon as you
feel<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.129> fish<00:02:45.370> TKE<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.879> want<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.150> streak<00:02:47.010> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
if you can do this wrong cast that means

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.149 
if you can do this wrong cast that means
you<00:02:52.569> can<00:02:52.750> fish<00:02:52.959> effectively<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:53.829> minimum

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
you can fish effectively with minimum

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.619 
you can fish effectively with minimum
disturbance<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.939> just<00:02:55.090> work<00:02:55.299> your<00:02:55.450> way<00:02:55.599> down

now<00:03:04.600> again<00:03:05.050> similar<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.740> salmon<00:03:06.130> which

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
now again similar to the salmon which

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.190 
now again similar to the salmon which
we'll<00:03:06.520> talk<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> bit<00:03:06.850> later<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:07.960> you<00:03:08.170> have

stream we can do the snap tee aside in
an<00:03:23.590> extra<00:03:23.980> day<00:03:24.100> mentioning<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.670> cast

an extra day mentioning of the cast
we're<00:03:25.930> going<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.170> lift<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.500> we're<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.830> do

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
we're going to lift it we're going to do

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.910 
we're going to lift it we're going to do
a<00:03:27.040> big<00:03:27.220> circle<00:03:28.030> clockwise<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> will<00:03:29.680> throw

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
a big circle clockwise and it will throw

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.870 
a big circle clockwise and it will throw
that<00:03:29.950> Lane<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:30.520> there<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.550> fold

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
that Lane up there like that and we fold

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.460 
that Lane up there like that and we fold
the<00:03:34.030> lane<00:03:34.150> over<00:03:34.420> itself<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.960> then<00:03:35.200> we<00:03:35.320> can

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the lane over itself and then we can

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.910 
the lane over itself and then we can
roll<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.710> with<00:03:36.010> our<00:03:36.160> nice<00:03:36.340> angle<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:41.800> that

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
roll a with our nice angle just do that

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.900 
roll a with our nice angle just do that
again<00:03:42.000> left<00:03:43.590> circle<00:03:44.590> draw<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.370> back<00:03:45.610> there's

again left circle draw it back there's

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
again left circle draw it back there's
your<00:03:46.060> anchor<00:03:46.330> point<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.810> rule<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.620> out<00:03:47.770> roll

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
your anchor point and rule it out roll
