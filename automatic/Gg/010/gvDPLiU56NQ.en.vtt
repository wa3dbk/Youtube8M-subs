00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.030
 jellyfish its name evokes beings 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.610
 gelatinous reports and even 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.089
 unpleasant in any case we do not 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.009
 seduces the idea of caressing us only if 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.940
 we have the opportunity to observe them 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.560
 underwater 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.450
 we discovered that these transparent 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.760
 creatures are really very elegant 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.950
 in the course of their evolution they have 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.480
 developed incredible capabilities and 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.640
 they have conquered all the oceans 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.150
 its defense mechanisms suppose a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.670
 danger even for humans 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.710
 those who know best these graceful and 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.560
 pernicious creatures of appearance 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 plant are called coelenterates a 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.820
 more scientific term 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.880
 this is doctor gerard yang one of the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 specialists better informed about 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.380
 jellyfish he will explain the exceptional 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.380
 biological cycle of these animals 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.910
 on a decker beach font in the sea 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.110
 Baltic numerous aurelia have been 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.970
 dragged to the beach 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.830
 for these two boys the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.670
 event assumes an original 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.159
 distraction 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.710
 there is no danger the arteries are not 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.280
 urticantes doctor gerard explains the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.170
 origin and development of jellyfish 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.840
 people feel disgust for these 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.630
 animals but they are more sensitive and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
 delicate of what is believed and what is 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.680
 more interesting its history goes back to 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.570
 500 million years ago around this 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 have developed the most 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.159
 striking and peculiar live at 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.210
 depths of the sea and also here in 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.210
 the Baltic coast 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.730
 apart from the influx of jellyfish that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.070
 sometimes they invade the Baltic and the sea of 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.680
 north the oceans are not plagued by 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.130
 them although these images suggest what 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.130
 contrary 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 where jellyfish come from, how and where 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.450
 they reproduce their biological cycle it 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.300
 characterized by the alternation of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.489
 sexual generation generations will 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.489
 it happens another asexual the vegetative 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.560
 the aurelia have male and female gender 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.540
 but their offspring are not born defined the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.520
 female distributes by the tiny water 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.120
 larvae that adhere to the substrate that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.120
 it suits you 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.450
 these little eight-armed discs that 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.060
 they try to get rid of a cecily polyp 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.040
 They are small jellyfish before they reach 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.470
 This state has been fifteen days 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.010
 originally the polyp had an aspect 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.010
 very different 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.930
 record the process requires a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.220
 very advanced technology all this is 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.220
 takes place in the laboratory 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.720
 gerard charm documents each stage with 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.500
 an endo camera in his laboratory the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.690
 University of Hamburg 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.610
 the larvae me your today have given them 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.650
 to a polyp that still has no relation 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.450
 some with jellyfish its only 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 purpose is to capture food 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.600
 when the colony of polyps reaches its 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.760
 optimum state of nutrition begins on 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.450
 separation process to create jellyfish 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.450
 individual 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.880
 the polyps have completely changed and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.800
 they resemble pineapples the formation of 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.500
 these little jellyfish discs is called 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.590
 strobel action of the Greek strobe the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.630
 skewers these discs will become 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.420
 big jellyfish but it will only survive 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.560
 about 1% the rest will serve 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.560
 food to predators 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.410
 the jellyfish pups are already 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.390
 perfectly developed among their 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.670
 tiny arms harbor organs 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.960
 sensory to see taste and 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.960
 control your position 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.749
 water is the main component of 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:07.969
 these tiny corpuscles 98% by 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.670
 the species the life of the jellyfish rocks 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.409
 between 1 and 30 years in that time can 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.810
 reach up to 200 times its size 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.230
 initial depending on the amount of 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.230
 food
