00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
know just like your natural hair the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.289 
know just like your natural hair the
ants<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.340> ready<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> need<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> trim

them<00:01:52.100> same<00:01:53.100> thing<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:53.640> i<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.630> doubt<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
them same thing here i just doubt that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
them same thing here i just doubt that
the<00:01:55.170> fibers<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.649> actually<00:01:56.040> split<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the fibers would actually split up the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.260 
the fibers would actually split up the
shaft<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.320> creates<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.890> new<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.520> newer

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
shaft but it just creates a new a newer

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
shaft but it just creates a new a newer
look<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.710> refreshes<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.799> stay

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
look to it and it refreshes it so stay

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.080 
look to it and it refreshes it so stay
