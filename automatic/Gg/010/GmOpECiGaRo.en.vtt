00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.950
 once it vegetates bronx and itching or enters 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 for two days to the room of time 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.210
 both the powers of vegueta and trunks 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.160
 they do not increase as much as vegueta 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.140
 is very proud to copy the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 goku method and surely decided 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.609
 find your own method however 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.529
 he failed and trunks not known well 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.509
 what he did not do but I suppose 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 get used to the transformation should 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.470
 be very complicated and much more being 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.079
 only in a place as desert as the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.089
 Meanwhile room time 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.130
 itch or made a great increase in power 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.829
 for him but it's not enough for the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.719
 perfect form of ceim and also itching 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.850
 she became a super namek already 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.559
 not for which now his powers do not 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 will increase as much as the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.089
 sayayin from this point because I already 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100
 he got his perfect itchy state and the 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.109
 only way to become stronger 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 blow would be merged with warriors 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.219
 lick couché and they were very powerful 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 also but now talking about figures 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.120
 what was his power both vegueta 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.399
 trunks by not finding the way to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.050
 overcome their powers in a 1 year 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.230
 training the logical thing would be that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.489
 could duplicate their powers that they had 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.140
 while itching or that is very smart 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.360
 for the trainings 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.000
 but that his power from now on 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.159
 grows more slowly it seems more 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 logical a power similar to that of 6 with its 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.390
 previous transformation which 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 would represent an increase of about 4 times 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.920
 in two years of training which I 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.619
 It seems very logical according to everything 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.170
 that I already mentioned from the beginning now 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.060
 let's go to the power of goku which gives us 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
 a sample when he expels half of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.259
 its maximum power in the karim tower with what 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 which vegueta felt that goku with the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.220
 half of his power had already passed 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 clearly the power of vegueta for that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.470
 reason I put a power of goku of about 25 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 billion to the maximum while wang 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.759
 when reaching the limit of the transformation 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.350
 also beat vegueta and trunks already 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.210
 that when he fights against 6 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 vegueta is very surprised to see the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.200
 goya power in which he already exceeded 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.060
 by little and was able to maintain for more 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.979
 time a fight against a being that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.710
 He fought with more power than he defeated 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.899
 vegueta previously but goku wise 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.550
 that with that level it would not earn him to do what 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.710
 The only thing I wanted was to goian 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.720
 anger and take out that hidden power and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 although Goku planned it badly and made him suffer 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.840
 to everyone and made the 6 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.790
 juniors 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.459
 with a power similar to that of goya that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 they could kill trump and vegueta and 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.500
 with a coconut wounded and weak still so 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.660
 he achieved the goal and one became enraged what 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.360
 that in theory would have multiplied by 10 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.790
 His power which would reach 150 thousand 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.220
 millions and now we can finally know 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 the true power of cell which at 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.810
 fight against one super sayayin two 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 It looks like it is, but goian shows that 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.010
 with a single blow you can destroy a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.970
 power of 15 billion like that of the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.040
 6 juniors 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.170
 then analyzed well the fight we see 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.060
 that in its first attacks does goian 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.610
 he still does not use the force he used to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 destroy the 6 juniors it would seem that 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.569
 there is not much difference against which 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.849
 He fights almost at the same level as Goku 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.860
 about 25 billion because which 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.569
 we can assume that 6 when he fought with 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.629
 swallowed he used half of his maximum 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.730
 power against one super saiyan 2 ci 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.769
 I would be using around 30,000 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.140
 millions of power which is 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.269
 theoretically 5 times less than one 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.549
 being this a huge difference that 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.410
 goian confirmed when cei to see that no 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.630
 could hurt him he raised his power to 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.380
 maximum which would double your power to 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.290
 about 60 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.210
 million but goian is still twice and 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.490
 average more powerful than six and how 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.710
 I mentioned before a power of double or more 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.810
 is capable of doing a lot of damage with just one 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.330
 attack and goian gave him two hits that 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.730
 they did that if you could not even stop 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.920
 so the theory of multiplying by 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.650
 ten the power has a lot of logic 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.600
 analyzing all the aspects starting 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.640
 from there they play, they just do it 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.800
 suffer since having wanted to kill him 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.390
 I would kill him immediately but as 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.880
 we know that if he is very intelligent 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.250
 found a way to destroy agoyán 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.490
 with the good land the history and the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.500
 you know goku sacrificed his life but 6 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.410
 returned with powers similar to those of a 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.540
 super sayayin 2 as goian doing that 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.450
 the power of being apparently is the same 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.220
 to goian's and although in my final opinion 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.080
 Goian still outperformed him, because 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.050
 it could be on the same side with one hand 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.000
 throwing the kamehameha but in the end it gives 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.230
 the same if he had the same power or a 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.840
 little less 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.209
 goián saved the earth and up to here 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.550
 ends this explanation that although it was 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.110
 something summarized would be very draining 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.930
 make it longer 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.939
 so I hope you like it if you like it 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.860
 subscribe follow I like the video 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:34.800
 in order to climb the saga of ma jin 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.960
 Wook a greeting and for as long as I live 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.960
 goku and dragon ball in our hearts
