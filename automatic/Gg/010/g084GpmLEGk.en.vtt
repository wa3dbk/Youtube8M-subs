 the beautiful thing is that was 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.189
 the hose 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.699

 it is very very simple 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.500
 With little effort percent to inflate the tire 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.330

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 after some Tigers as scum simply unscrew 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.810
