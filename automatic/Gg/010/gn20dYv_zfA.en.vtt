00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hey guys what's up its oxygen zero and

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey guys what's up its oxygen zero and
um<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.440> my<00:00:04.500> first<00:00:04.680> time<00:00:04.859> ever<00:00:04.980> doing<00:00:05.220> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
um this is my first time ever doing a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.490 
um this is my first time ever doing a
video<00:00:05.640> like<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.359> just<00:00:06.480> found<00:00:07.049> this

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
video like this now I just found this

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.400 
video like this now I just found this
spot<00:00:07.859> yet<00:00:08.340> last<00:00:08.550> night<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.260> map

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
spot yet last night on the map

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.689 
spot yet last night on the map
resistance<00:00:11.599> which<00:00:14.059> for<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.470> survival<00:00:16.470> mode<00:00:16.800> on

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
resistance which for a survival mode on

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.359 
resistance which for a survival mode on
resistance<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.109> literally<00:00:19.619> sit<00:00:20.010> here

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
resistance you can literally sit here

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.340 
resistance you can literally sit here
and<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> only<00:00:21.330> spot<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.140> take

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and this is the only spot you can take

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.040 
and this is the only spot you can take
fire<00:00:22.619> from<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.970> guy<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.420> top<00:00:24.750> there

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
fire from is this one guy up top there

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.429 
fire from is this one guy up top there
and<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.849> kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> glitch<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.140> only

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
and so it's kind of a glitch the only

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.040 
and so it's kind of a glitch the only
time<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.490> glitch<00:00:29.970> won't<00:00:30.330> water<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
time that this glitch won't water is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450 
time that this glitch won't water is
during<00:00:31.410> chopper<00:00:31.769> rounds<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
during chopper rounds but there's a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.290 
during chopper rounds but there's a
tunnel<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.480> over<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.550> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.969> get

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
tunnel right over there and if you get

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090 
tunnel right over there and if you get
into<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> tunnel<00:00:36.870> during<00:00:37.140> chopper<00:00:37.620> rounds<00:00:37.980> or

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
into the tunnel during chopper rounds or

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
into the tunnel during chopper rounds or
if<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.520> an<00:00:38.640> LMG<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> take<00:00:39.570> down

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
if you have an LMG and you can take down

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
if you have an LMG and you can take down
choppers<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.059> first

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
choppers from in here when they first

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.779 
choppers from in here when they first
come<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.840> you're<00:00:43.739> basically<00:00:44.010> invulnerable

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
come in you're basically invulnerable

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
come in you're basically invulnerable
because<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> pop<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:46.129> take<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.309> shots

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
because you can pop up take some shots

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.840 
because you can pop up take some shots
and<00:00:47.850> duck<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.550> soon<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and duck back down so as soon as you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.479 
and duck back down so as soon as you
start<00:00:51.059> getting<00:00:51.120> wounded<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.250> duck<00:00:53.250> back

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
start getting wounded you can duck back

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090 
start getting wounded you can duck back
down<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> mean<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.289> practically

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
down so I mean you are practically

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
down so I mean you are practically
invulnerable<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.590> as<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.859> see

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
invulnerable in here and as you can see

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.869 
invulnerable in here and as you can see
people<00:00:59.460> start<00:00:59.820> grouping<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:01.100> spots<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
people start grouping up in spots so

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.640 
people start grouping up in spots so
like<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.359> higher<00:01:03.600> rounds<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.559> be

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
like on higher rounds this would be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.950 
like on higher rounds this would be
incredibly<00:01:05.400> effective<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.650> it's<00:01:08.750> it's<00:01:09.750> not

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
incredibly effective and it's it's not

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
incredibly effective and it's it's not
flawless<00:01:10.560> obviously<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.549> taking<00:01:11.939> some

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
flawless obviously I'm taking some

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
flawless obviously I'm taking some
rounds<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.509> higher<00:01:15.720> rounds<00:01:16.200> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
rounds but in the higher rounds they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100 
rounds but in the higher rounds they
actually<00:01:17.189> chase<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
actually chase you right over here and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
actually chase you right over here and
they<00:01:19.350> will<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:19.650> wind<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.939> as

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
they will actually wind up just and as

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.190 
they will actually wind up just and as
you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.360> those<00:01:21.540> grenades<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.020> doing

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you can see those grenades are doing

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.690 
you can see those grenades are doing
nothing<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.619> me<00:01:22.890> while<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> here

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
nothing to me while I'm in here

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
nothing to me while I'm in here
at<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.350> higher<00:01:25.530> rounds<00:01:25.860> when<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
at the higher rounds when they have the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
at the higher rounds when they have the
assault<00:01:26.700> rifles<00:01:27.150> ooh<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:29.460> one's<00:01:29.640> close<00:01:29.880> they

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
assault rifles ooh that one's close they

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
assault rifles ooh that one's close they
just<00:01:31.110> throw<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.320> back

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
just throw it back

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
just throw it back
I<00:01:33.320> mean<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> lower<00:01:34.680> rounds<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I mean at the lower rounds this is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100 
I mean at the lower rounds this is
completely<00:01:35.759> pointless<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.899> way

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
completely pointless to do it this way

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.690 
completely pointless to do it this way
because<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.530> could<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.280> mean<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> could

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
because I could just I can mean I could

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.950 
because I could just I can mean I could
run<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> gun<00:01:40.820> but<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> higher<00:01:45.210> altitude

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
run a gun but on the higher altitude

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.649 
run a gun but on the higher altitude
that<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.560> an<00:01:46.830> amazing<00:01:47.369> advantage<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.539> be

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that would be an amazing advantage to be

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539 
that would be an amazing advantage to be
able<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.200> covered<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
able to get covered like that that you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
able to get covered like that that you
can't<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:51.060> rounds<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.570> people<00:01:51.990> like

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
can't take rounds from people like

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.179 
can't take rounds from people like
imagine<00:01:53.250> taking<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.330> um<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> juggernaut

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
imagine taking out um like a juggernaut

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.580 
imagine taking out um like a juggernaut
round<00:01:56.429> when<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.080> know<00:01:58.110> two<00:01:58.439> or

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
round when you have you know two or

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
round when you have you know two or
three<00:01:58.619> juggernauts<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> can't

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
three juggernauts on you and you can't

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.859 
three juggernauts on you and you can't
get<00:02:00.360> away<00:02:00.450> from<00:02:00.539> them<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.570> let<00:02:03.570> me<00:02:03.659> ready

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
get away from them so like let me ready

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.789 
get away from them so like let me ready
up<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.869> because<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.990> did<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.560> higher

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
up and because I did this on a higher

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.469 
up and because I did this on a higher
round<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.489> didn't<00:02:08.789> actually<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.299> for<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
round I didn't actually do it for the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.120 
round I didn't actually do it for the
whole<00:02:09.509> round<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.140> discovered<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.799> I<00:02:10.950> was

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
whole round I just discovered it I was

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.800 
whole round I just discovered it I was
looking<00:02:11.370> around<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> have

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
looking around and that's all you have

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.030 
looking around and that's all you have
to<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.140> climb<00:02:13.350> up<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
to do you climb up here and then you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.650 
to do you climb up here and then you
just<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.459> settle<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.150> these<00:02:15.269> crates

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
just kind of settle in with these crates

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.910 
just kind of settle in with these crates
and<00:02:17.299> you're<00:02:18.299> basically<00:02:18.780> safe<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:21.709> then<00:02:22.709> all

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and you're basically safe and then all

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.979 
and you're basically safe and then all
you<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.340> pop<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.120> take<00:02:24.299> your<00:02:24.450> shots<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
you do is pop up and take your shots and

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.539 
you do is pop up and take your shots and
then<00:02:25.200> duck<00:02:25.410> back<00:02:25.590> down<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
then duck back down and on one of the

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.640 
then duck back down and on one of the
later<00:02:29.819> rounds<00:02:30.090> when<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.450> was<00:02:30.660> experimenting

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
later rounds when I was experimenting

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.370 
later rounds when I was experimenting
with<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.130> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> running<00:02:32.549> around

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
with this and kind of running around

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.289 
with this and kind of running around
guys<00:02:34.380> were<00:02:34.620> literally<00:02:35.010> bunching<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:35.910> just

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
guys were literally bunching up just

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.000 
guys were literally bunching up just
outside<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.049> kind<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.769> they<00:02:37.890> are

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
outside of this kind of like they are

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.170 
outside of this kind of like they are
now<00:02:43.010> even<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.100> flashbang<00:02:44.700> did<00:02:44.880> hardly

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
now even that flashbang did hardly

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.199 
now even that flashbang did hardly
affect<00:02:45.450> me

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.640 

okay<00:02:53.209> let's<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:53.569> how<00:02:53.689> the<00:02:53.750> dogs<00:02:54.019> do<00:02:54.290> against

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
okay let's see how the dogs do against

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.229 
okay let's see how the dogs do against
this<00:02:54.769> cuz<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.430> haven't<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.819> didn't<00:02:56.090> actually

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
this cuz I haven't I didn't actually

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.839 
this cuz I haven't I didn't actually
experiment<00:02:56.840> with<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.079> against<00:02:57.439> dogs<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.010> can't

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
experiment with it against dogs I can't

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:09.220 
experiment with it against dogs I can't
imagine<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.269> dogs<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.750> get<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.140> oh<00:03:08.230> wow

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
imagine the dogs can get to you oh wow

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.289 
imagine the dogs can get to you oh wow
that's<00:03:09.620> that's<00:03:10.159> even<00:03:10.459> better<00:03:10.730> if<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.239> could

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
that's that's even better if I could

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.970 
that's that's even better if I could
peek<00:03:11.599> out<00:03:11.780> here<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.349> some<00:03:12.379> shots<00:03:12.709> on

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
peek out here and get some shots on

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.030 
peek out here and get some shots on
people<00:03:14.019> yeah<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.139> dog<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.500> just<00:03:15.530> sitting

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
people yeah the dog is just sitting

anything<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.989> just<00:03:36.230> thought<00:03:36.409> I'd<00:03:36.590> show<00:03:36.980> this

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
anything so I just thought I'd show this

anything so I just thought I'd show this
off<00:03:37.400> show<00:03:37.879> this<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.269> guys<00:03:38.419> see<00:03:38.629> what<00:03:38.750> you

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
off show this to you guys see what you

guys thought of it see see what kind of

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.069 
guys thought of it see see what kind of
strategies<00:03:41.269> do<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.419> guys<00:03:41.599> would<00:03:41.780> think<00:03:41.930> of

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
strategies do you guys would think of

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.940 
strategies do you guys would think of
for<00:03:42.349> using<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:44.290> also<00:03:45.290> because<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.709> didn't

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
for using this and also because I didn't

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.800 
for using this and also because I didn't
want<00:03:46.099> somebody<00:03:46.489> else<00:03:46.609> to<00:03:46.790> exploit<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:47.540> to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
want somebody else to exploit this to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.569 
want somebody else to exploit this to
get<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.109> like<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> high<00:03:48.530> high<00:03:48.769> round<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:49.370> then

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
get to like a high high round and then

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.530 
get to like a high high round and then
claim<00:03:49.909> that<00:03:49.939> it<00:03:50.329> was<00:03:50.450> completely<00:03:51.290> legit<00:03:52.540> I'm

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
claim that it was completely legit I'm

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.670 
claim that it was completely legit I'm

I'm back inside my my spot here and this
is<00:04:42.990> an<00:04:43.110> mp5<00:04:43.530> round<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:43.980> they<00:04:44.100> have<00:04:44.250> mp5<00:04:44.760> and

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
is an mp5 round so they have mp5 and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.660 
is an mp5 round so they have mp5 and
basically<00:04:46.970> they<00:04:47.970> can't<00:04:48.270> do<00:04:48.420> anything<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.900> me

and<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.990> only<00:04:52.020> spot<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.500> guys<00:04:52.860> could<00:04:53.130> really

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
and the only spot that guys could really

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.760 
and the only spot that guys could really
get<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.700> you<00:04:53.820> would<00:04:54.030> be<00:04:54.060> up<00:04:54.450> there<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.020> I

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
get to you would be up there and I

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.800 
get to you would be up there and I
honestly<00:04:56.550> don't<00:04:57.000> think<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.510> on<00:04:57.630> these

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
honestly don't think that on these

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:07.480 
honestly don't think that on these
rounds<00:04:58.140> these<00:04:58.260> guys<00:04:58.530> will<00:04:58.740> climb<00:04:58.950> up<00:04:59.100> there

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.620 

you<00:05:08.490> see<00:05:08.670> as<00:05:08.940> soon<00:05:09.120> as<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.300> start<00:05:09.510> taking

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
you see as soon as you start taking

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.709 
you see as soon as you start taking
damage<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.260> can<00:05:10.410> just<00:05:10.590> duck<00:05:10.830> down

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
damage you can just duck down

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:18.459 
damage you can just duck down
and<00:05:13.110> then<00:05:13.679> just<00:05:14.330> use<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.509> to<00:05:16.069> pop<00:05:17.069> in<00:05:17.279> and<00:05:17.429> out

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
and then just use it to pop in and out

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.629 
and then just use it to pop in and out
then<00:05:19.469> just<00:05:19.499> climb<00:05:19.830> out<00:05:20.009> in<00:05:20.189> between<00:05:20.459> rounds

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
then just climb out in between rounds

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.039 
then just climb out in between rounds
and<00:05:21.029> you<00:05:21.209> can<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.539> buy<00:05:21.719> em<00:05:21.989> Oh<00:05:23.809> out<00:05:24.809> of<00:05:24.869> the

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
still basically just that one spot that

00:06:26.410 --> 00:07:12.850 
still basically just that one spot that
they<00:06:26.530> can<00:06:26.680> get<00:06:26.890> you<00:06:27.100> from

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669 
long as you have enough EMA to survive

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:31.429 
long as you have enough EMA to survive
the<00:07:26.879> round<00:07:28.969> you<00:07:29.969> could<00:07:30.150> pretty<00:07:31.110> much<00:07:31.229> just
