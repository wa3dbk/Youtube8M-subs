followers we're also responsible for
providing<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.680> oppositional<00:00:47.460> connection

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
providing that oppositional connection

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
providing that oppositional connection
so<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> leader<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.510> gonna<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.960> something<00:00:49.320> with

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so the leader is gonna do something with

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.810 
so the leader is gonna do something with
the<00:00:49.530> connection<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.160> can't<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> unless

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the connection but he can't do it unless

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
the connection but he can't do it unless
we<00:00:50.940> also<00:00:51.239> give<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.289> he's<00:00:52.559> pulling<00:00:52.739> back

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
we also give it so as he's pulling back

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.830 
we also give it so as he's pulling back
a<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.399> I'm<00:00:53.760> gonna<00:00:53.910> resist<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.539> pushing

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
a little bit I'm gonna resist by pushing

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
a little bit I'm gonna resist by pushing
forward<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:55.949> gives<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.250> bigger

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
forward and then when he gives a bigger

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
forward and then when he gives a bigger
pull<00:00:56.910> backwards<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.600> he<00:00:57.719> moves<00:00:57.899> his<00:00:58.020> entire

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
pull backwards when he moves his entire

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
pull backwards when he moves his entire
body<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:59.489> that's<00:00:59.699> gonna<00:00:59.850> carry<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.359> body<00:01:00.570> as

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
body then that's gonna carry my body as

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
body then that's gonna carry my body as
well<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> don't

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
well so I want to make sure that I don't

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
well so I want to make sure that I don't
just<00:01:02.640> let<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:02.879> arms<00:01:03.149> collapse<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.870> did<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
just let my arms collapse if I did that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
just let my arms collapse if I did that
when<00:01:04.619> he<00:01:04.739> tried<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:05.220> back<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> initial

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
when he tried to go back on that initial

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.190 
when he tried to go back on that initial
step<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.200> would<00:01:07.320> look<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:09.020> I<00:01:10.020> want

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
step it would look like that so I want

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
step it would look like that so I want
to<00:01:10.290> keep<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.590> own<00:01:10.740> arms<00:01:11.040> engaged<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.670> I'm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
to keep my own arms engaged as I'm

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
to keep my own arms engaged as I'm
providing<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.600> opposition<00:01:12.840> okay<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.650> let's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
providing that opposition okay so let's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
providing that opposition okay so let's
try<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.670> another<00:01:14.909> angle<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.840> mention

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
try it from another angle I will mention

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
try it from another angle I will mention
that<00:01:16.140> leaders<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.070> connection<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> really

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that leaders this connection is really

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
that leaders this connection is really
what<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.420> about<00:01:18.479> we're<00:01:18.930> sending<00:01:19.500> her

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
what it's all about we're sending her

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.109 
what it's all about we're sending her
back<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.070> hands<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.490> along<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> ride

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
back this hands going along for the ride

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
back this hands going along for the ride
but<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.750> primarily<00:01:22.259> what's<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.979> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but it's primarily what's going on in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
but it's primarily what's going on in
this<00:01:23.250> area<00:01:23.780> starting<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> basic<00:01:25.400> 1<00:01:26.400> 2<00:01:26.759> 3

back we've done five six seven a one two
Rock<00:01:43.470> step<00:01:43.860> we've<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.970> momentum

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Rock step we've got all this momentum

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.810 
Rock step we've got all this momentum
going<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> way<00:01:46.350> here's<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> need<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
going this way here's where you need to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
going this way here's where you need to
kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> give<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.840> resistance<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
kind of give a little resistance and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
kind of give a little resistance and
help<00:01:50.250> stop<00:01:50.640> her<00:01:50.880> momentum<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> forearm

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
help stop her momentum with that forearm

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.870 
help stop her momentum with that forearm
connection<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.009> was<00:01:53.159> important<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.790> her

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
connection it was important to get her
