mysteriously<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:47.159> able<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
mysteriously and it's able to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.139 
mysteriously and it's able to
shape-shift<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.500> host<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.130> whatever<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
shape-shift into the host of whatever it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.200 
shape-shift into the host of whatever it
wants<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> thing<00:01:53.280> takes<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
you die along with it and then the thing

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
you die along with it and then the thing
uses<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.140> body<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.710> essentially<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
uses your body so essentially it's a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030
