00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.599
 Translation is the translation of one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.740
 messenger rna code in a protein 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.990
 You we are some important 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 molecules need why the groceries 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.350
 after the small and the large part of it 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.449
 her ribosome and transport rna 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.449
 finally the real sea factor 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.330
 translation proceeds in 3 steps 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.890
 Start 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.350
 extension's phase and termination it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.079
 messenger rna from eukaryotic cells 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 is translated from the 5 accent to the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.260
 who accent tip to the three accent 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.800
 at the ends is a tail with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.800
 many a's 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.090
 with translation I become the messenger 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.090
 rna codes 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.010
 translated into an amino acid sequence but 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.850
 with five accent ends 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.850
 a methyl group 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 starting phase it connects first 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 groceries afterwards with the 5 accent 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.860
 are out there with small part of it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.189
 ribosome this slide through to it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 start column a ug where the translation 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.909
 it starts a delicate name with it 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.820
 anticodon uhse connects with this 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.200
 start codon dictate after it contains 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.200
 amino acid methionine 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.210
 at the same time the large ribosome binds 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.010
 share the transportation there at this place 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.830
 namely methionine 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.830
 wind on the p site of the ribosome 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.390
 next to that is the a site 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.380
 the following transport is bound here 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.870
 were after this has an anticodon that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.940
 fits the following codon 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.340
 the extension's phase then becomes 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.190
 methionine with a peptide bond to 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.759
 with amino acid on the a site linked it 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.950
 empty transport r &amp; a falls out of the p site and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.020
 the second tea and then move on to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.880
 the p site 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.360
 now the next transport to it 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.340
 bind on the site released 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.590
 this process repeats itself so that the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.590
 amino acid chain is getting longer 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.170
 the termination when a stop codon on 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.990
 the to sites appears 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.240
 wind to it ariely sing factor 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.400
 this disconnect the amino acid chain from 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.980
 the transport afterwards and you break the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.550
 connection between trna and it 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.550
 messenger rna 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.530
 a polypeptide chain has now been created
