00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.200 
between your tongue and your teeth you
want<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.670> lick<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.090> back<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:10.170> want<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.440> bite<00:05:10.740> it

University chemical engineers decided to

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.470 
University chemical engineers decided to

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
build a mechanical tongue and they did

build a mechanical tongue and they did
so<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.230> they<00:05:46.590> came<00:05:46.860> up<00:05:47.100> with<00:05:47.630> 317<00:05:48.630> licks

strong<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.460> can<00:05:56.640> definitely<00:05:57.150> take<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.660> licking
