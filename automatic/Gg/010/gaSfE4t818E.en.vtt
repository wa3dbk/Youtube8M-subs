00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.290
 Südbad, built in the fifties, has been shining since this spring 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.799
 in new splendor 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.860
 In about 14 months, the outdoor pool and we celebrate elaborately renovated 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.810
 Actually, the city had planned to close the old super but one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.239
 Citizens' Initiative collected 22,000 signatures from Ecclestone for 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.099
 the receipt of the bath ranks 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.859
 the commitment was worthwhile and the city decided to redevelop it 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.589
 Framework of a public-private partnership 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:36.600
 implement 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.890
 Trier Mayor Angelika Birk explains the motivation of the start 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220
 for the realization of the project 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.060
 The iPad is a very large record of the qe measures we take as a city 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.010
 Trier alone could not have ended at all 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.160
 besides, it would have taken much longer to raise the money than 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.070
 also technically implement the measure because our 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.140
 Percent responsible in the department of construction 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.980
 are entrusted with many other tasks as well so it has 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.670
 Build faster 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.670
 and also guaranteed by Haiti as build 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.910
 Tomas is managing director of the project development company 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.830
 rhineland 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.090
 she explains how such a partnership looks like 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.890
 the motto of PPP so far to get better together so that know-how 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.890
 to introduce the start of the city administration of construction management and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 but at the same time the Primo Haut SR contractor or every Bäder Bauer 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.740
 to bring in a girl 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.759
 the city defines what it expects so what I want 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.900
 Percent of the contractor she has in the case of zip files one 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.670
 Frame planning was then reported by the contractor edition 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 and Dr percent on tract Niemeyer had relatively often unit in Dr Klan 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.450
 Editing but he must definite qualities that are urgently defined 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.540
 in the contract 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.280
 Apart from the planning and the remedial measures, he takes care of the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.619
 private contractors also to the maintenance of the couple 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.969
 Patrick Trade Partnership is a long term concept for both 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.969
 the city as well as the contractor has advantages 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.069
 So the good thing about the PP is long-term quality assurance and 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.159
 benefits from it 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.489
 the client therefore the city and above all the visitors and 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.779
 Visitors of the bath 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.360
 because of the track 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.899
 nobody guarantees 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.689
 A good to very good quality over a long period of time 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.259
 Period of 25 years is secured so this is the benefit of the city of 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:46.099
 Contractor so the private he has the advantage that they have one 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.219
 long-term goal listed construction contract Open has many construction companies have yes 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.599
 usually percent orders for the completion of a building or 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.920
 of a building and then the job ends 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.740
 this order had been given 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.760
 an assignment that runs over 25 years 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:07.529
 that was a visitor benefit from the refurbishment it remains at the closer 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.469
 Contemplation of the bath 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.369
 newest children's play area at the entrance of the bath of the Capricorn play garden 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.369
 and concerns the playing field 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.919
 the leisure pool with two small slips still stands and 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.229
 was complemented by a swing bay 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.849
 The swimmer pool consists of five lanes of 50 meters each and leaves 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.179
 seamlessly over in the basin to ten meters diving tower 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:38.189
 after the two small groups can not meet up to the 75 meters 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.189
 long lever steirischer let off steam 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.200
 I want masters instead of the usual visitor groups 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 especially to the reconstruction of the bathroom benefit 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.690
 the change is 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.800
 It's a lot of way mothers with toddlers from at 60 everyday now 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.759
 Profile for the toddler percent purchased 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.619
 especially the value of the water games percentage range for the toddlers 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.319
 Tests as the biggest 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.219
 Additional profits now for us 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.379
 All in all, it was very happy with the positive reactions of the visitors 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.090
 So the resonance is actually very good for two is because of assumed 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.509
 the bathers here 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.079
 especially the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.139
 Play area sends the kids that we now a little bit more for the kids 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.240
 have a joke 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.909
 always praiseworthy mentioned 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.219
 our water slide of course and the whole quartet on its own 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.669
 good at very good 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.520
 especially in the construction sector but also in the technical equipment were 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.819
 mainly involved companies from the region 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.569
 However, not only have quality been respected while relying on sustainability 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.549
 so on the roof of the entrance building was a solar system 

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:51.959
 installed the leisure activities and the children's pool heated 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.490
 from the city because the cooperation with a private 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.370
 Contractor a very positive experience than just one 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.169
 with music percent quite enthusiastically say that the construction times despite diverse 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.850
 minor and major problems encountered by the farmers have been respected 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.439
 were 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.999
 So far we have a very good cooperation with the company too 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.709
 Think technical service supports and also for cleaning the couple 

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.389
 responsible for 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.189
 We now have an accurate plan to make important tasks for the company 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.060
 next 25 years 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.979
 because so long is the contract 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.819
 In order to be able to afford Jeglic to the functioning of the bath in the 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.819
 Maintain current quality 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.619
 after the first bathing lake at the reopening one can say that the 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:45.619
 new Südbad arrives very well with the visitors 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.590
 the best percent I like-click large lawn and freedom of the press 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.330
 lead 4 percent has on the site 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.749
 You do not do it yourself 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.129
 Percent to a neighbor was not worth it 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.129
 Prof at the other outdoor pools 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.719
 asks this question 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.119
 noblest materials 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.119
 Details he did not name Manfred Scholle 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.680
 while he is satisfied 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.610
 September three children are very up 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.400
 APA unfortunately no radiator injuries 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.069
 in case of difficulties 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.069
 before departure 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.569
 We all give a lot of advice there 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.619
 It would not be the case of the contract 12 o'clock would like to open tomorrow 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.919
 Summit openly fascinated 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:38.990
 is presented 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.930
 Piper were 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.520
 the weir became 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 if open android software maybe already gone 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:49.649
 May to 6 more but the key 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.490
 So the Triers do not have to give up and then we can dispense 

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:55.669
 look forward to many more summer months
