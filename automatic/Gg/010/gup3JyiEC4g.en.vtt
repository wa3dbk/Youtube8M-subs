gigantic<00:00:39.629> marshmallows<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.469> don't<00:00:40.620> know<00:00:40.680> if

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
gigantic marshmallows I don't know if

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.770 
gigantic marshmallows I don't know if
they<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.860> super-sized<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.850> something<00:00:42.120> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
they like super-sized or something but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.130 
they like super-sized or something but
um<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.440> think<00:00:44.340> they're<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.510> sighs<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
um how I think they're like that sighs I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
um how I think they're like that sighs I
don't<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:46.920> they're<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.480> slightly

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.020 
don't know I think they're just slightly
smaller<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.440> they're<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.649> tiny<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.489> guess<00:00:50.910> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
smaller but they're not tiny I guess it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.369 
smaller but they're not tiny I guess it
