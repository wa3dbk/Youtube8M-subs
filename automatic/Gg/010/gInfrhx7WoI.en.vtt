 HELLO CURIOUS EYES! In this tutorial we will show you how to characterize the character of Into the Woods THE WOLF 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
 We start with the wardrobe 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.900
 We cut the fabric with hair, to form the bangs, the ears and the cuffs of the sleeves 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.120
 We painted a streaks with white paint and we spread it by hand 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 We sew the pieces of hair in the shape of an ear to the sides of a hat 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.600
 we paint a strip of paper with silver paint and we make a few strokes in white, gray and black 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 we sew bangs to the hat 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.820
 we cut the black fabric to make the tie 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.740
 we stick with special adhesive for fabric 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 We do the same with red cloth 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.800
 we painted the black tie with white diagonal stroke 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.660
 we make a flower with red cloth 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 and we sew it in the American. We fake a pocket 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.120
 To clarify the color of the jacket, we apply white spray 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.460
 we make wavy lines in black 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 To make the trunk cut out a cardboard in the desired shape 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 wrinkle the cardboard and make some "churros" that will serve to create the crevices 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 We stick the crumpled cardboard on the cardboard and create the crevices 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.220
 we make another layer over with pinocho paper 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 we paint it with black paint 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.060
 for the background, we will draw branches on a blue paper 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.760
 For the makeup we will start with the eyebrows. We clean them with alcohol. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 We cover them with glue in bar 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.880
 We extend the base of makeup 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.620
 we cover the mobile eyelid with a matte brown shade 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.980
 For the eyebrows and the mustache we use black crepe 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.300
 we apply mastix 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.480
 and we are sticking the hairs so that they protrude from the end and the top 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.020
 we cut the ends until we get the desired shape 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.180
 fix with lacquer so that the ends are tipped up 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.780
 we just filled with a black eyeliner and we make small strokes with white watercolor 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.440
 With a dark brown shadow, we give depth to the inner part of the eye. following the shape of the nose 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 We emphasize with a black pencil all the contour of the eye. We apply black mascara 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820
 we contoured the nose and marked the eye bags with brown shadow 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.140
 we repeat the same process of eyebrows in the mustache 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 we outline the lips with a brown pencil and fill with a very light nude lipstick 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.160
 we draw a small knob under the lip with an eyeliner 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.720
 We collect all the hair in a low ponytail, and hide it under the clothes. We only leave a few strands on the front and we cremate them 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.580
 We collect the strands to create the medium hair effect and paint them with a black spray, especially for hair 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.580
 The hands are painted with light gray water and with a darker one we mark the folds of the fingers 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.280
 we stick black nails with the silver tips 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 We complete the transformation with the complements 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.040
 and we have our LOBO ready 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.100
