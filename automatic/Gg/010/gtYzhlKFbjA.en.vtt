but<00:00:46.780> I've<00:00:47.320> mounted<00:00:47.680> a<00:00:48.059> 1024<00:00:49.059> tap<00:00:49.420> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.370> Chuck

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.299 
but I've mounted a 1024 tap in the Chuck
or<00:00:52.030> I<00:00:52.059> should<00:00:52.539> say<00:00:52.719> in<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.870> collet<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.559> it's<00:00:54.190> a

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
or I should say in the collet and it's a

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.760 
or I should say in the collet and it's a
machining<00:00:54.940> tap<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.629> not<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.809> hand<00:00:56.140> tap<00:00:56.440> and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
machining tap that is not a hand tap and

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.400 
machining tap that is not a hand tap and
it<00:00:57.520> sometimes<00:00:58.210> it's<00:00:58.420> called<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.750> gun<00:00:58.989> tap

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
it sometimes it's called a gun tap

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.479 
it sometimes it's called a gun tap
because<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.949> shoots<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:01.440> chip<00:01:02.440> through<00:01:03.309> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
because it shoots the chip through the

because it shoots the chip through the
hole<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:04.000> doesn't<00:01:04.059> bring<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:04.539> back<00:01:04.720> out<00:01:04.899> it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
hole it doesn't bring it back out it

hole it doesn't bring it back out it
shoots<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:06.009> out<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.490> bottom<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.660> it's<00:01:07.780> not

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
shoots it out the bottom so it's not

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.950 
shoots it out the bottom so it's not
really<00:01:08.259> good<00:01:08.410> for<00:01:08.910> holes<00:01:09.910> at<00:01:10.240> bottom<00:01:10.600> eyelets

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
really good for holes at bottom eyelets

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.190 
really good for holes at bottom eyelets
for<00:01:11.229> open<00:01:11.619> holes<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.509> there's<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.570> shank<00:01:13.960> on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
the top here it's a half-inch diameter

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.660 
the top here it's a half-inch diameter
shank<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.509> we'll<00:01:16.600> hold<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:17.110> right<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:18.160> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
shank and we'll hold that right in the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.179 
shank and we'll hold that right in the
chuck<00:01:18.940> larger<00:01:19.900> models<00:01:20.290> often<00:01:20.530> have<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.860> taper

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
chuck larger models often have a taper

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.280 
chuck larger models often have a taper
shank<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.689> has<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> straight

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
shank that this one just has a straight

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.850 
shank that this one just has a straight
shank<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:26.080> will<00:01:26.259> automatically

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
shank and this will automatically

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.120 
shank and this will automatically
reverse<00:01:27.610> when<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.030> get<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:29.380> your<00:01:29.560> depth<00:01:29.830> stop

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
reverse when you get to your depth stop

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.420 
reverse when you get to your depth stop
or<00:01:30.579> however<00:01:31.180> deep<00:01:31.600> you're<00:01:31.780> going<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.430> one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
or however deep you're going and one

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.280 
or however deep you're going and one
interesting<00:01:34.000> thing<00:01:34.030> about<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.509> tapping<00:01:35.079> head

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
interesting thing about a tapping head

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.520 
interesting thing about a tapping head
is<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.860> will<00:01:36.009> reverse<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.229> runs

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
is that it will reverse what it runs

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.350 
is that it will reverse what it runs
faster<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.280> reverse<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:39.909> what<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.150> doesn't

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
faster and reverse and what it doesn't

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
faster and reverse and what it doesn't
forward<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.320> other<00:01:41.409> words<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:43.110> tap<00:01:44.110> goes

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
forward so in other words the tap goes

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.080 
forward so in other words the tap goes
in<00:01:44.590> at<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.770> certain<00:01:44.950> rate<00:01:45.310> but<00:01:45.549> it'll<00:01:45.759> come<00:01:45.909> out

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
in at a certain rate but it'll come out

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.969 
in at a certain rate but it'll come out
at<00:01:46.420> about<00:01:47.009> twice<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.040> rate<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:49.860> we're<00:01:50.860> going

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
at about twice that rate and we're going

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.859 
at about twice that rate and we're going
to<00:01:51.040> run<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.310> drill<00:01:51.520> press<00:01:51.729> at<00:01:52.119> its<00:01:52.390> slowest

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
to run the drill press at its slowest

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.690 
to run the drill press at its slowest
speed<00:01:53.170> although<00:01:53.470> we<00:01:53.799> certainly<00:01:53.979> could<00:01:54.399> run<00:01:54.579> it

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
speed although we certainly could run it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.719 
speed although we certainly could run it
at<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> faster<00:01:55.390> speed<00:01:55.420> for<00:01:56.729> aluminum

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
at a faster speed for aluminum

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.399 
at a faster speed for aluminum
especially<00:01:58.270> we're<00:01:58.450> going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.630> tap<00:01:58.840> one<00:01:59.110> plate

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
especially we're going to tap one plate

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.350 
especially we're going to tap one plate
with<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:02.649> made<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.979> aluminum<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.640> another

with that's made of aluminum and another
one<00:02:04.630> that's<00:02:04.990> made<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.610> steel<00:02:06.610> will<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
one that's made of steel will do the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.090 
one that's made of steel will do the
aluminum<00:02:07.930> one<00:02:08.110> first<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:10.440> stand<00:02:11.440> by<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.010> I'll

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
aluminum one first and stand by and I'll

six<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.100> these<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.760> fast<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:47.110> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
six of these just as fast as can be and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.100 
six of these just as fast as can be and
I've<00:02:47.980> set<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.550> depth<00:02:48.850> stop<00:02:49.150> here<00:02:49.690> such<00:02:50.080> that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
I've set the depth stop here such that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.190 
I've set the depth stop here such that
when<00:02:50.650> we<00:02:50.800> go<00:02:51.040> all<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.520> way<00:02:51.640> through<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.170> we

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
when we go all the way through and we

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.199 
when we go all the way through and we
hit<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> bottom<00:02:54.310> here<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:56.819> device<00:02:57.819> will

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
hit the bottom here the device will

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.180 
hit the bottom here the device will
reverse<00:02:58.569> itself<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.380> don't<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.890> reverse

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
reverse itself you don't have to reverse

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.640 
reverse itself you don't have to reverse
it<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:01.150> automatic<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.410> going<00:03:02.560> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
it it's automatic and it's going to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.430 
it it's automatic and it's going to
happen<00:03:02.980> real<00:03:03.220> quick<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.660> then<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> few<00:03:05.230> minutes

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
after that we're going to tap the steel

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.630 
after that we're going to tap the steel
and<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.810> will<00:03:07.989> use<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.380> regular<00:03:08.590> tapping<00:03:09.280> fluid

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and I will use the regular tapping fluid

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.030 
and I will use the regular tapping fluid
of<00:03:09.730> course<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.269> use<00:03:10.390> oil<00:03:10.600> as<00:03:10.930> well<00:03:11.140> but<00:03:11.860> do

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
not use this tapping fluid with aluminum

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.500 
not use this tapping fluid with aluminum
or<00:03:15.910> it'll<00:03:16.920> gum<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.069> up<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.970> don't<00:03:19.090> want<00:03:19.209> that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
or it'll gum it up you don't want that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.070

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
freshly tapped holes okay now we're

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.240 
freshly tapped holes okay now we're
going<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.760> tap<00:04:23.030> steel<00:04:23.390> I<00:04:24.070> already<00:04:25.070> put<00:04:25.220> some

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
going to tap steel I already put some

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.570 
going to tap steel I already put some
tapping<00:04:25.820> fluid<00:04:26.180> on

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
I'm going to use

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.850 
I'm going to use
load<00:04:35.460> on<00:04:35.729> each<00:04:35.759> one<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.539> uses<00:04:36.960> steel<00:04:37.409> it's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
load on each one that uses steel it's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.129 
load on each one that uses steel it's
not

just a little bit of squeaking going on
there<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.470> just<00:04:55.120> three<00:04:56.120> holes<00:04:56.440> then<00:04:57.440> steel<00:04:58.180> size

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
there I just three holes then steel size

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:07.300 
there I just three holes then steel size
1024<00:05:04.540> now<00:05:05.540> here<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.900> a<00:05:05.960> much<00:05:06.200> larger<00:05:06.800> capping

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310
