here that there's this kind of weird

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
here that there's this kind of weird
depression<00:00:53.670> almost<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> circle<00:00:55.050> halo

sure that's pretty worn

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
sure that's pretty worn
then<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> one's<00:01:01.079> odd<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
then this one's odd if you look at the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.850 
then this one's odd if you look at the
twos<00:01:03.860> I'll<00:01:04.860> bring<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.030> normal<00:01:06.600> two<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
twos I'll bring over a normal two so you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.830 
twos I'll bring over a normal two so you
can<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> look<00:01:08.369> look<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> curly<00:01:09.390> ends

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
can have a look look at the curly ends

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.620 
can have a look look at the curly ends
so<00:01:10.049> you've<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.710> straight<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.270> then

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so you've got a straight two and then

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.980 
so you've got a straight two and then
these<00:01:12.780> bizarrely<00:01:13.380> curly<00:01:14.159> ones<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:15.659> going

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it's also got lines which i think looks

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
it's also got lines which i think looks
like<00:01:53.009> struck<00:01:53.340> through<00:01:53.549> cloth<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.689> look<00:01:54.840> at

like struck through cloth but look at

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.670 
like struck through cloth but look at
the<00:01:55.079> number<00:01:55.380> nine<00:01:55.909> nine<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the number nine nine and one there and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.789 
the number nine nine and one there and
then<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> leaves<00:01:59.759> down<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.020> doubled<00:02:01.560> as

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
then the leaves down here all doubled as

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.990
