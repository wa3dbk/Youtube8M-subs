moved<00:04:13.460> level<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:16.459> forth<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.850> little

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
moved level and and so forth a little

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.449 
moved level and and so forth a little
more<00:04:17.270> excitement<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.900> them<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.830> then<00:04:19.190> you<00:04:19.310> had

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
more excitement to them and then you had

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.110 
more excitement to them and then you had
the<00:04:19.580> park<00:04:19.820> horse<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.360> was<00:04:20.480> elevated<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.440> and

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
the park horse that was elevated and and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.540 
the park horse that was elevated and and
really<00:04:23.120> exciting<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:25.070> maybe<00:04:25.280> not

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
really exciting and and it maybe not

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.820 
really exciting and and it maybe not
quite<00:04:25.910> as<00:04:28.450> harmonious<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:30.020> know<00:04:30.140> because<00:04:30.680> of

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
quite as harmonious you know because of

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.650 
quite as harmonious you know because of
the<00:04:31.310> greed<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.790> way<00:04:32.030> they're<00:04:32.210> built<00:04:32.360> and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
the greed and the way they're built and

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.630 
the greed and the way they're built and
so<00:04:32.780> forth<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.200> very<00:04:33.530> exciting<00:04:34.040> class<00:04:34.310> and

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
so forth but a very exciting class and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.420 
so forth but a very exciting class and
lots<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:35.030> motion<00:04:35.500> now<00:04:36.500> I'm<00:04:36.770> looking<00:04:37.160> at<00:04:37.280> the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
lots of motion now I'm looking at the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.760 
lots of motion now I'm looking at the
country<00:04:37.820> class<00:04:38.060> here<00:04:38.780> at<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> show<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.620> as

parcours<00:05:06.710> class<00:05:06.980> is<00:05:07.190> dwindling<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:09.889> know

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
parcours class is dwindling and you know

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.379 
parcours class is dwindling and you know
maybe<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.490> better<00:05:10.639> horses<00:05:11.000> are<00:05:11.270> in<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
maybe the better horses are in the

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.090 
maybe the better horses are in the
English<00:05:11.660> pleasure<00:05:11.930> class<00:05:12.260> but<00:05:12.590> they're<00:05:12.860> being

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
English pleasure class but they're being

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.409 
English pleasure class but they're being
ridden<00:05:13.370> like<00:05:13.520> fire<00:05:13.760> courses<00:05:14.150> rather<00:05:14.300> than

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
ridden like fire courses rather than

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.180 
ridden like fire courses rather than
English<00:05:14.540> pleasure<00:05:14.930> whores<00:05:15.139> so<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.590> think<00:05:15.919> it's

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
English pleasure whores so I think it's

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.190 
English pleasure whores so I think it's
getting<00:05:16.490> messed<00:05:16.730> up<00:05:17.030> ok<00:05:17.630> could<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:17.870> talk<00:05:18.169> a

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
getting messed up ok could you talk a

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.680 
getting messed up ok could you talk a
little<00:05:18.440> bit<00:05:18.680> about<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:19.210> you're<00:05:20.210> talking

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
little bit about that you're talking

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.920 
little bit about that you're talking
about<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.110> English<00:05:21.260> pleasure<00:05:21.860> horse

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
about the English pleasure horse

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.570 
about the English pleasure horse
potentially<00:05:23.930> I'm<00:05:24.380> hearing<00:05:24.800> that<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.280> think

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
potentially I'm hearing that you think

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.400 
potentially I'm hearing that you think
it's<00:05:25.760> maybe<00:05:26.030> not<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.540> much<00:05:26.660> of<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.960> pleasure<00:05:27.169> to

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
it's maybe not so much of a pleasure to

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.740 
it's maybe not so much of a pleasure to
ride<00:05:27.560> anymore<00:05:27.980> it's<00:05:28.700> definitely<00:05:29.240> it's<00:05:29.570> not<00:05:29.630> a

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
ride anymore it's definitely it's not a

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.840 
ride anymore it's definitely it's not a
pleasure<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.230> look<00:05:30.410> at<00:05:30.620> for<00:05:30.860> me<00:05:31.010> ok<00:05:31.430> but<00:05:31.760> it

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
pleasure to look at for me ok but it

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.090 
pleasure to look at for me ok but it
seems<00:05:32.120> like<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.570> standard<00:05:33.200> which<00:05:33.680> is<00:05:33.710> you

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
seems like the standard which is you

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.129 
seems like the standard which is you
know<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.730> judges<00:05:35.180> in<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.570> middle<00:05:35.870> of<00:05:35.990> them

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
know the judges in the middle of them

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.810 
know the judges in the middle of them
actually<00:05:36.410> determine<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.190> standard<00:05:37.669> and

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
actually determine the standard and

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.150 
actually determine the standard and
becomes<00:05:38.150> very<00:05:38.330> difficult<00:05:38.570> when<00:05:39.080> all<00:05:39.860> your

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
becomes very difficult when all your

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.310 
becomes very difficult when all your
better<00:05:40.370> horses<00:05:40.729> are<00:05:41.030> being<00:05:41.180> overwritten<00:05:41.960> and

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
better horses are being overwritten and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.600 
better horses are being overwritten and
you'd<00:05:42.620> like<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.979> see<00:05:43.190> them

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
you'd like to see them

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.610 
you'd like to see them
sure<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:44.479> still<00:05:44.720> have<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:45.050> pin<00:05:45.260> them<00:05:45.410> so

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
sure but you still have to pin them so

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.180 
sure but you still have to pin them so
you<00:05:45.680> pin<00:05:46.010> them<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.760> then<00:05:47.419> everybody<00:05:47.870> else

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
you pin them and then everybody else

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.100 
you pin them and then everybody else
wants<00:05:49.190> to<00:05:49.370> win<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.060> next<00:05:50.210> class<00:05:50.570> they<00:05:50.810> they

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
wants to win the next class they they

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.500 
wants to win the next class they they
tend<00:05:51.320> to<00:05:51.440> start<00:05:51.710> over<00:05:51.979> riding<00:05:52.250> I've<00:05:53.060> guilty

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
tend to start over riding I've guilty

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.120 
tend to start over riding I've guilty
the<00:05:53.660> same<00:05:53.870> thing<00:05:54.139> when<00:05:54.290> I<00:05:54.320> was<00:05:54.590> still<00:05:54.889> showing

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
the same thing when I was still showing

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.780 
the same thing when I was still showing
sure

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
sure

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.990 
sure
so<00:05:56.210> it's<00:05:56.870> evolved<00:05:57.470> where<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:58.130> really<00:05:58.700> just

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
so it's evolved where it really just

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.440 
so it's evolved where it really just
become<00:05:59.540> one<00:05:59.780> horse<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.410> it's<00:06:01.090> out<00:06:02.090> there<00:06:02.270> with

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
become one horse and it's out there with

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.990 
become one horse and it's out there with
my<00:06:02.600> wife<00:06:02.630> Aaron<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:03.740> trying<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.610> figure<00:06:04.760> out

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
my wife Aaron and trying to figure out
