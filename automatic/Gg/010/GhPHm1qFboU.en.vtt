my<00:00:06.270> name<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.629> Marcelo<00:00:07.170> quill<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.940> I

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
my name is Marcelo quill you and I

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.549 
my name is Marcelo quill you and I
worked<00:00:09.269> at<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.420> intersection<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.080> computers

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
worked at the intersection of computers

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.600 
worked at the intersection of computers
and<00:00:10.860> materials

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
and materials

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.509 
and materials
I<00:00:11.719> like<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> physicality<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.219> work<00:00:14.370> that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
I like the physicality of the work that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.620 
I like the physicality of the work that
I<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.929> I'm<00:00:15.929> always<00:00:16.080> building<00:00:16.619> physical<00:00:16.980> things

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
I do I'm always building physical things

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.210 
I do I'm always building physical things
sometimes<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.410> an<00:00:19.470> idea<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.740> my<00:00:19.830> head<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
sometimes I have an idea in my head and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.769 
sometimes I have an idea in my head and
having<00:00:20.430> something<00:00:20.760> physical<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.600> can

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
having something physical that you can

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.620 
having something physical that you can
sort<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.400> project<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.550> thought<00:00:23.580> into<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
sort of project your thought into and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
sort of project your thought into and
use<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> tool<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> experiment<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
use that as a tool to experiment and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.620 
use that as a tool to experiment and
think<00:00:26.640> about<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> design<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> you're

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
think about the design that you're

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
think about the design that you're
trying<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> achieve<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.099> important

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
trying to achieve is really so important

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.389 
trying to achieve is really so important
for<00:00:29.580> me<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> pixels<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
for me this is one of the pixels of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.760 
for me this is one of the pixels of
resolution<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> network<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.649> I've

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
resolution this is a network that I've

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.090 
resolution this is a network that I've
created<00:00:35.390> where<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.690> created<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.680> series<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
created where we created a series of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.729 
created where we created a series of
individual<00:00:38.969> boxes<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.110> even<00:00:40.350> interact

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
individual boxes that can even interact

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
individual boxes that can even interact
with<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> put<00:00:42.210> them<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> wall<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
with and you can put them on a wall and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
with and you can put them on a wall and
create<00:00:43.170> different<00:00:43.980> arrangements<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.629> way

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
create different arrangements a good way

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.330 
create different arrangements a good way
to<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> digital

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to think of it is it's kind of a digital

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.779 
to think of it is it's kind of a digital
we're<00:00:47.489> fitty<00:00:47.719> in<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:49.170> way<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.789> can

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
we're fitty in some way that you can

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.420 
we're fitty in some way that you can
write<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> create<00:00:51.480> graffiti<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> pen<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
write and create graffiti with a pen you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
write and create graffiti with a pen you
can<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> case<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.600> pixels<00:00:55.190> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
can do it in this case with pixels so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
can do it in this case with pixels so
there's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> lot<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.910> goes<00:00:56.940> into<00:00:57.149> designing

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there's a lot that goes into designing

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.889 
there's a lot that goes into designing
something<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.149> on<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.329> level<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.780> have

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
something like this on one level we have

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
something like this on one level we have
the<00:01:00.930> aesthetic<00:01:02.239> interaction<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.359> have

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the aesthetic interaction that you have

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
the aesthetic interaction that you have
with<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.320> we're<00:01:04.530> trying<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> get

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
with it right so we're trying to get

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
with it right so we're trying to get
this<00:01:05.010> curve<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.339> look<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this curve to look right and we want it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.260 
this curve to look right and we want it
to<00:01:07.350> feel<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> hold<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to feel right when you hold it if you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.120 
to feel right when you hold it if you
like<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> good<00:01:09.750> grasp<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> but

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
like you have a good grasp of it but

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.109 
like you have a good grasp of it but
there's<00:01:11.280> also<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> technical<00:01:11.939> stuff

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
there's also a lot of technical stuff

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
there's also a lot of technical stuff
that<00:01:12.420> happens<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.350> there's<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that happens here right we there's a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.170 
that happens here right we there's a
circuit<00:01:14.159> board<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.400> goes<00:01:14.580> inside<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
circuit board that goes inside and that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
circuit board that goes inside and that
has<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.450> fit<00:01:15.600> perfectly<00:01:16.100> they're<00:01:17.100> magnets

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
has to fit perfectly they're magnets

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
has to fit perfectly they're magnets
they<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.759> underneath<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.150> allow<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
they go underneath that allow the the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.260 
they go underneath that allow the the
box<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> picture<00:01:20.369> true<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.909> stuck<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
box or the picture true so it's stuck to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
box or the picture true so it's stuck to
the<00:01:21.360> metal<00:01:21.390> plate<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.380> behind<00:01:22.680> me

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the metal plate that's that's behind me

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.670 
the metal plate that's that's behind me
and<00:01:23.220> there's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> special<00:01:24.689> diffuser<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.409> goes

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and there's a special diffuser that goes

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
and there's a special diffuser that goes
here<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.640> those<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.210> like

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
here and and all those things are like

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
here and and all those things are like
very<00:01:27.570> perfectly<00:01:28.049> designs<00:01:28.470> whether<00:01:28.740> they're

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
very perfectly designs whether they're

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
very perfectly designs whether they're
super<00:01:29.909> tight<00:01:29.939> there's<00:01:30.420> no<00:01:30.960> space<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.259> error

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
super tight there's no space for error

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
super tight there's no space for error
and<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.880> you'd<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.450> impossible<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and if you'd be really impossible to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.710 
and if you'd be really impossible to
prototype<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.799> any<00:01:34.950> other<00:01:35.070> way<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.759> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
prototype this in any other way and it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
prototype this in any other way and it's
it's<00:01:37.049> great<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.409> once<00:01:37.710> we're<00:01:37.890> done<00:01:37.979> with

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
it's great because once we're done with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
it's great because once we're done with
the<00:01:38.220> design<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.000> literally<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.390> send<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the design we can literally just send it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
the design we can literally just send it
to<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.960> injection<00:01:40.350> molded<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.909> from<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to get injection molded so we go from a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.819 
to get injection molded so we go from a
CAD<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.720> 3d<00:01:42.960> printer<00:01:43.259> injection<00:01:43.619> mold<00:01:43.770> very

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
CAD to 3d printer injection mold very
