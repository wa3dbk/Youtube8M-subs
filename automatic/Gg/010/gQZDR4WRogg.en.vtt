00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
change in there it might be a little bit

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.060 
change in there it might be a little bit
hard<00:02:25.270> with<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.570> cut<00:02:25.810> inside<00:02:26.260> if<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.560> put<00:02:26.770> you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
in there so just like that or we can put

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.960 
in there so just like that or we can put
more<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:38.650> cuts<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.160> there<00:02:39.430> but<00:02:39.850> you

more like some cuts in there but you

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.820 
more like some cuts in there but you
know<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.240> bit<00:02:40.390> hard<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.660> get<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.080> get<00:02:41.800> it

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830

finger<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.770> not<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.100> easy<00:02:45.400> or<00:02:45.700> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
finger in and it's not that easy or I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.230 
finger in and it's not that easy or I
can<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.360> know<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.600> achieve<00:02:48.060> throating<00:02:49.060> out

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
can you know I can achieve throating out

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.500 
can you know I can achieve throating out
like<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:52.410> let's<00:02:53.410> see<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.920> Chanel<00:02:54.280> one<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
Chanel one the front just like that when

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.290 
Chanel one the front just like that when
I<00:02:57.580> open<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.360> button<00:02:59.220> there<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.430> one<00:03:00.790> flat

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
I open the button there is one flat

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.380 
I open the button there is one flat
pocket<00:03:01.780> at<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.959> front<00:03:02.410> two<00:03:02.770> on<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.760> side<00:03:04.060> as

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
pocket at the front two on the side as

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.449 
pocket at the front two on the side as
you<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.840> see<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.320> can<00:03:05.530> actually<00:03:05.680> stretch<00:03:06.220> out

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
you can see it can actually stretch out

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.660 
you can see it can actually stretch out
just<00:03:07.000> like<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:08.739> quite<00:03:08.890> spacious<00:03:09.190> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
just like that so it's quite spacious in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.880 
just like that so it's quite spacious in
size<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.959> small<00:03:11.320> piece<00:03:11.620> like

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
size you know for a small piece like

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.990 
size you know for a small piece like
this<00:03:12.130> one<00:03:13.260> let's<00:03:14.260> see<00:03:14.560> what<00:03:14.770> I<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:15.100> fit<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.550> so

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
this one let's see what I can fit in so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.120 
this one let's see what I can fit in so
a<00:03:16.030> stack<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.660> 25<00:03:17.260> business<00:03:17.890> cards<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:19.560> easy<00:03:20.560> yes

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
they will have more space in there so

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.190 
they will have more space in there so
let's<00:03:23.410> see<00:03:23.680> if<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.190> put<00:03:24.430> some<00:03:24.700> more<00:03:25.030> like<00:03:25.750> cuts

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200

cards<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.650> still<00:03:32.920> some<00:03:33.190> more

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
cards just like that so still some more

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.090 
cards just like that so still some more
space<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.000> know<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.420> can<00:03:34.660> actually<00:03:34.750> put<00:03:35.200> for

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
space you know I can actually put for

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.759 
space you know I can actually put for
example<00:03:36.549> like<00:03:36.760> not<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:37.750> there<00:03:37.989> thank<00:03:38.470> know

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
example like not in there thank know

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.650 
example like not in there thank know
what<00:03:38.920> at<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> front<00:03:39.489> money<00:03:39.700> not<00:03:39.940> in<00:03:39.970> there<00:03:40.299> I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
what at the front money not in there I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.020 
what at the front money not in there I
can<00:03:41.049> put<00:03:41.260> some<00:03:41.470> small<00:03:41.769> change<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.400> game<00:03:42.670> and

can put some small change in game and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.660 
can put some small change in game and
still<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.110> know<00:03:44.230> there's<00:03:44.890> some<00:03:45.070> more<00:03:45.280> space

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
still you know there's some more space

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.340 
still you know there's some more space
in<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.330> when<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.810> want<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.140> get

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
in there and when I want to get

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.259 
in there and when I want to get
something<00:03:47.560> out<00:03:48.010> it's<00:03:48.340> quite<00:03:48.610> easy<00:03:48.850> because

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
something out it's quite easy because

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.530 
something out it's quite easy because
the<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.230> know<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.590> sides<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.250> be<00:03:51.540> stretched

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
the you know the sides can be stretched

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.759 
the you know the sides can be stretched
out<00:03:52.720> like<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.930> actually<00:03:56.170> easier<00:03:56.709> to

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
out like that so it's actually easier to

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.860 
out like that so it's actually easier to
get<00:03:57.040> things<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:57.790> out<00:03:57.910> compared<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
get things in and out compared to the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.080 
get things in and out compared to the
LOI<00:03:59.320> beat<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.739> one<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:02.519> can<00:04:03.519> actually<00:04:03.880> use

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
LOI beat on one and I can actually use

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.690 
LOI beat on one and I can actually use
it<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.480> know<00:04:04.600> as<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> small<00:04:05.320> cosmetic<00:04:06.160> pouch

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
you might not believe it but let's see

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.400 
you might not believe it but let's see
you<00:04:09.220> know<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:09.760> example<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:10.450> probably<00:04:11.230> don't

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
you know for example I probably don't

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.190
