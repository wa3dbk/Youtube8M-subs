 Actually we go to the gig and so must 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.729
 I 'm getting dressed tonight 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.370
 Everyone has their own career 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:57.560
 then they pay and now I am 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.180
 just put on too early 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.590

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.650
 dressed, what did you wear? 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 today such a striped shirt and short 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.580
 pants 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.160
 flipflops and flipflops that actually 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:21.510
 I have that 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:24.090
 that 's our point meter that's it 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.190
 that's one of a kind of one that has it for me 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.040
 the trucks and I want to be awesome 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.670
 nice and it is located in mannheim 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.440
 were oh how does that feel after 20 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.990
 years, it is more of a class trip 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.669
 or is it called tell it yes it is 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.610
 actually a class trip and us 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.770
 I believe now with almost 20 me 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.000
 have lost the overview 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.610
 we are with almost 20 artists has the 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.070
 stage continue office and these are natural 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.470
 so outrageously different characters 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.650
 that's just never really 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.490
 boring and I believe for that 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.350
 Sometimes Michael is a bit 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.610
 more difficult because of the existence since 20 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.800
 keep whole heap years together 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.419
 must and I believe that too much 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.330
 associated stress is that is I believe 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.410
 just an anthill the ballet 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.940
 to teach dancing as the sons 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.140
 mannheim's really focused the 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.300
 to keep up the good times though 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.680
 this is less for those people 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.320
 have responsibility as he in me 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.940
 In this case, a huge fun josh 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.450
 And Sandra says something else to her 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.430
 couple or at least deal with it 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.250
 actually a few are yes of course 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.210
 she's been a couple for half a year now and 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.620
 we have a little thought now 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.690
 make a flash wedding a bit 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.490

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.229

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.060
 You have been married for a long time 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.060
 five years together different 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.620
 even now you have that only now 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.320
 I would say we are walking 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.810

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.479
