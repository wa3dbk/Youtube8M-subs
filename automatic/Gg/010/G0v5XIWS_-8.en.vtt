Hi everyone from Guerz86, this is the tutorial to install Lollipop on Sony Xperia Z3 and Z3C

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.180

The tutorial starts on the minute 0:52

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:07.700
If you have already connected a Sony device with your Windows PC you have already installed the drivers, otherwise you should install the flashtool's drivers and the device's driver. These drivers are in the flashtool's folder that you should install on your PC (link in the description).

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.500
On the website you will find the article (link in the description) about Lollipop that you will find the ftf file. You should download this file.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.420
When the installation is finished, you should open the programe, select the flashmode on the left side (the thunderbolt icon) and select the Lollipop firmware.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.140
After some minutes, you should have a screen like this with the words "Wait for flashmode"

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:20.580
Now you should turn off your device and follow the instruction in the window. After that press the volume down button and wait the flashing process.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:12.280
When the program has finished you will have Android Lollipop installed on your Sony Xperia Z3 and Z3C!
