00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.719
 we almost overcome the hangover of the mobile 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.639
 world congress and to take stock of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.400
 everything we saw in this huge fair 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.439
 There were four days of tablet phones 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 physical activity meters and everything 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.029
 kind of gadgets you need a summary I am 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.490
 franco marta for cinema in Spanish and today 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.240
 I bring you the top 5 news that more 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.789
 they called our attention in Barcelona 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.059
 with the number 5 the telephone with system 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.580
 operational firefox of 25 dollars worth 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.440
 this is just a prototype and possibly 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.540
 not one that you want to buy if you're a 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.430
 technology lover but mozilla has 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.590
 proven that you can make a phone 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.750
 decent with basic functions to a 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.550
 minimum price and now that most of 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.949
 companies are struggling to open up 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.710
 way in emerging markets this 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.800
 achievement is no nonsense and in the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.930
 position number 4 the black phone the idea 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.580
 with this device is to offer the greatest 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.620
 possible safety without having to 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.290
 give up good do on a phone 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.119
 mobile encrypted storage mails 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.940
 protected in the cloud anonymous browsing 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.950
 the black swan promises everything in matter 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.750
 security is not yet to know 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.610
 if it is truly effective but the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.580
 Privacy protection worries us 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.800
 and this initiative is very interesting 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.380
 and for number 3 we go back to the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.470
 conventional phones with the sony 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 xperia z 2 the successor of z 1 has a 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.180
 something bigger screen a processor 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 a little more powerful one more version 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.130
 recent android and a camera that 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.770
 record 4k video is complete is 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.080
 Elegant is luxurious and is resistant to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.700
 Water is simply one of the best 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.399
 devices that we have seen these days 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.200
 and with number two a phone that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.229
 sure you were already missing 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 The Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.219
 it is true that samsung has disappointed a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.890
 little to those who expected a new design 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.929
 and amazing news but not so much 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 to leave it out of this list 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.679
 is 5 has fingerprint sensor 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.200
 fingerprint heart rate monitor 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.569
 better features in the camera some 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 changes in the interface more colors not 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.830
 win our top 5 but still 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.190
 on the podium of high-end phones 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.170
 range and with the number 1 the glove 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.630
 smart and fujitsu glasses 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.760
 because it's different because it has 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.950
 surprised and because it's good to see 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.079
 that computer dress is good for 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.310
 something more than telling steps or calling the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.200
 attention in a bar 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.390
 fujitsu wants to improve manual work 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.360
 with this glove that helps you for example 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.610
 to detect faults and repair faults 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.849
 we are scheduled to see it until 2015 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.220
 but it certainly has potential and there the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.319
 you have the five devices that most 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.540
 they caught our attention on the mobile 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.970

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.470
 see this technology more closely 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.000

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.280

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.010
