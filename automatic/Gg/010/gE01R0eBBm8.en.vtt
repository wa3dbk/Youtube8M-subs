surrounding that race that is a problem

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.740 
surrounding that race that is a problem
first<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.459> all<00:02:52.579> in<00:02:52.760> order<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.090> participate<00:02:53.450> in

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
first of all in order to participate in

first of all in order to participate in
the<00:02:53.959> race<00:02:54.109> you<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.439> to<00:02:54.470> get<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.799> copy<00:02:55.010> early

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the race you have to get to copy early

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.479 
the race you have to get to copy early
because<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.090> majority<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.689> the<00:02:57.319> time<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
because the majority of the time the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.069 
because the majority of the time the
teams<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:58.909> are<00:02:59.030> racing<00:02:59.419> to<00:02:59.540> max<00:02:59.720> prestige

start before the official release date

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.309 
start before the official release date
so<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.269> problem<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:02.900> there<00:03:03.019> needs<00:03:03.169> to<00:03:03.260> be

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
so that's a problem so there needs to be

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.409 
so that's a problem so there needs to be
an<00:03:03.500> official<00:03:03.859> release<00:03:04.129> or<00:03:04.370> official<00:03:05.060> start

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
actually win this can when the game has

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.230 
actually win this can when the game has
a<00:05:37.409> good<00:05:37.620> connection<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.279> actually<00:05:38.759> love<00:05:39.089> this

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240

playing<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.889> quite<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.460> bit<00:05:41.580> hopefully<00:05:42.120> they

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
playing it quite a bit hopefully they

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.390

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
can improve the the networking in

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.670 
can improve the the networking in
connections<00:05:44.849> a<00:05:44.969> little<00:05:45.029> bit<00:05:45.330> but<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.110> think<00:05:46.409> I

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
connections a little bit but I think I

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.249 
connections a little bit but I think I
