00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.090 
ago that even though people say that
they<00:06:23.370> don't<00:06:23.400> use<00:06:23.730> sprays<00:06:24.060> or<00:06:24.800> pesticides<00:06:25.800> that

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
they don't use sprays or pesticides that

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.710 
they don't use sprays or pesticides that
they<00:06:26.820> do<00:06:26.880> use<00:06:27.660> those<00:06:28.500> chemical<00:06:29.720> fertilizers

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
they do use those chemical fertilizers

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.740 
they do use those chemical fertilizers
so<00:06:31.140> it's<00:06:31.440> just<00:06:31.590> something<00:06:32.010> to<00:06:32.190> be<00:06:32.220> aware<00:06:32.750> of

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
so it's just something to be aware of

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.320 
so it's just something to be aware of
trying<00:06:34.680> to<00:06:34.860> buy<00:06:35.010> everything<00:06:35.400> from<00:06:35.940> people
