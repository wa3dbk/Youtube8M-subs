00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.650
 however we kept the field well 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.030
 we have not suffered much, perhaps 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.680
 some ball inactive anyway that them 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 physically they were very strong 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.160
 but when they attacked us anyway 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
 have always been a lot 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 be careful if to climb that in any case that to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.259
 do the 23 minutes offside well i must 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.790
 thank the coach also all 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.980
 companies that gave me this 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.470
 possibility but also to my companions 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 the team also those who are 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.410
 fixed in the first team that have me 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.850
 congratulated all and I want 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.580
 to thank at this time also mine 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.110
 there was a bit of family emotion 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.890
 seeing you from the forum 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.900
 no emotion for me I was in Naples 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.470
 when I was first in the first team 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.650
 at the dock after how week is 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.390
 normal a little in all the people outside 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.520
 when I entered he no longer saw the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.220
 out of people I want to give everything 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.710
 for school but I think I certainly do 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.119
 better than the last one last 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.439
 game is still a point we 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.030
 brought home where we didn't go in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 field to win but do not throw 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.190
 at this point the heat is felt 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.530
 it is slightly there was not one 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.420
 very cool temperature however we have 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.460
 tried to do my best and football is 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 made of episodes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.230
 today however we know what a match is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.750
 an easy game however they had 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.550
 thus the goal of salvation e 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.480
 we do however to make a good one 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.460
 race 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.960
 I think we have been good at 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.620
 hold the field well to play to do 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.280
 much possession we lacked a bit 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.870
 maybe the last step to go 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.460
 for the door to be the most dangerous 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.130
 anyway we had some of them anyway 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.370
 some occasions we have failed to 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.750
 score goals at the end 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.980
 result may be right 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.170
 we had prepared this match 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.370
 obviously to try to win it as 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.040
 we always do 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.280
 I certainly think we have been in 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.200
 line with a good mentality also in the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.730
 ball possession after that point of view 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.970
 from which we think I grew the most 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.490
 instead I think we were less less 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.590
 dangerous the last 20 meters but there was 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.880
 first I believe that the attack 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.470
 in the last two and a half months it has been 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.540
 supported everything on his shoulders 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.360
 we asked for overtime and him 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.330
 according to me there is often lavished 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.520
 doing even for two in quotes 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.010
 so in this already seeing when 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.020
 Antonio entered when he entered Cassano 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.520
 in the last 25 30 minutes we have 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.490
 definitely acquired danger 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.110
 depth is undeniable that it is normal 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.570
 that in the last 20 meters of absences then 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.430
