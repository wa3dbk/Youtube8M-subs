thinking about him for a while well I
felt<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.600> head<00:00:24.869> needed<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.740> more

felt my head needed a little bit more
bling<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.449> decided<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.619> more

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
bling so I decided to get two more

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.310 
bling so I decided to get two more
piercings<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.460> ear<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> first<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.289> is

piercings in my ear the first one is
just<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.679> second<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.369> second<00:00:33.120> hole<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.809> ear

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079

just a second a second hole in my ear
and<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.710> ear<00:00:34.920> low<00:00:35.239> nothing<00:00:36.239> special<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and with my ear low nothing special the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.369 
and with my ear low nothing special the
second<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.100> my<00:00:38.309> tragus<00:00:38.640> piercing<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.540> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
second one is my tragus piercing and I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.830 
second one is my tragus piercing and I
decided<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> tragus<00:00:41.250> piercing<00:00:41.840> primarily

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
decided on the tragus piercing primarily

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.770 
decided on the tragus piercing primarily
because<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.559> wanted<00:00:43.829> something<00:00:44.280> kind<00:00:44.780> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
because I wanted something kind of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.650 
because I wanted something kind of
unique<00:00:46.219> but<00:00:47.219> nothing<00:00:48.059> that's<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> get

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
unique but nothing that's going to get

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.889 
unique but nothing that's going to get
me<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.930> trouble<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.410> work<00:00:49.579> because<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.789> job<00:00:51.120> has

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
me in trouble at work because my job has

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.189 
me in trouble at work because my job has
a<00:00:52.379> rural<00:00:52.770> strict<00:00:53.190> rule<00:00:53.460> no<00:00:53.940> face<00:00:54.239> piercings<00:00:54.870> so

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a rural strict rule no face piercings so

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.310 
a rural strict rule no face piercings so
it<00:00:55.260> kind<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.500> limits<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.129> whatever<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> um

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it kind of limits me or whatever but um

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
it kind of limits me or whatever but um
this<00:00:58.649> technically<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.820> face<00:01:00.059> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this technically is not my face so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
this technically is not my face so
hopefully<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> fuss<00:01:01.859> about

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hopefully they don't make a fuss about

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.370 
hopefully they don't make a fuss about
it<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:03.239> anyways<00:01:03.989> um<00:01:05.570> overall<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.140> it
