crucial issue

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.950

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
together I look there's no doubt that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.330 
together I look there's no doubt that
father's<00:02:56.990> play<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> unique<00:02:57.680> role<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.250> the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
household and one of the reasons we see

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.300 
household and one of the reasons we see
so<00:03:01.940> many<00:03:02.290> challenges<00:03:03.290> in<00:03:03.710> our<00:03:03.770> country<00:03:04.130> right

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so many challenges in our country right

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.130 
so many challenges in our country right
now<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.820> is<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.540> breakdown<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.990> the

now is is the breakdown of the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.350 
now is is the breakdown of the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
two-parent household would you be ready

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.630 
two-parent household would you be ready
to<00:03:08.600> do<00:03:08.720> something<00:03:08.990> about<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.950> change<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
to do something about that to change the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.610 
to do something about that to change the
policies<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.300> be<00:03:11.420> more<00:03:11.570> father<00:03:11.780> friendly<00:03:12.290> sure

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
policies to be more father friendly sure

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.900

I'll<00:03:12.740> be<00:03:12.800> happy<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.070> look<00:03:13.220> at<00:03:13.370> those<00:03:13.490> policies

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
I'll be happy to look at those policies

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.830 
I'll be happy to look at those policies
and<00:03:14.060> say<00:03:14.210> we<00:03:14.330> certainly<00:03:14.570> shouldn't<00:03:14.720> be

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
and say we certainly shouldn't be

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.180 
and say we certainly shouldn't be
