think you can solve all the elbow from

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.400 
think you can solve all the elbow from
left<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> right<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.670> then<00:02:20.670> upper<00:02:21.209> torso<00:02:21.750> we

the<00:02:55.060> only<00:02:55.300> thing<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:56.080> some<00:02:56.290> gripe<00:02:56.620> about

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
the only thing I have some gripe about

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.759 
the only thing I have some gripe about
the<00:02:57.099> figure<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:58.000> neck<00:02:58.269> joint<00:02:58.569> he<00:02:59.170> really

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
the figure is the neck joint he really

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.650 
the figure is the neck joint he really
does<00:03:00.040> look<00:03:00.340> hunched<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.850> looks<00:03:01.569> like

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
does look hunched and looks like

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.039 
does look hunched and looks like
somewhat<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.440> durable<00:03:02.860> thick<00:03:03.069> feel<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:04.269> I'm

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
somewhat a durable thick feel but I'm

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.979 
somewhat a durable thick feel but I'm
not<00:03:05.739> really<00:03:06.310> digging<00:03:06.519> v-neck<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.720> here

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
not really digging v-neck right here

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.080 
not really digging v-neck right here
because<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.890> shoulders<00:03:09.190> are<00:03:09.370> too<00:03:09.519> low<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
because the shoulders are too low and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.370 
because the shoulders are too low and
you<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:10.959> feel<00:03:11.349> that<00:03:11.670> there<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.910> some

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
you can feel that there is some

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.890 
you can feel that there is some
unevenness<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.160> figure<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:16.060> those<00:03:16.599> are

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
unevenness to the figure so those are

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.320 
unevenness to the figure so those are
the<00:03:17.019> owning<00:03:17.349> types<00:03:17.620> but<00:03:17.860> if<00:03:18.099> once<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.880> move

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
the owning types but if once you move

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.210 
the owning types but if once you move
the<00:03:19.599> head<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.170> tilt<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.340> certain<00:03:22.180> way<00:03:22.390> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
the head and tilt it in a certain way it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.520 
the head and tilt it in a certain way it
doesn't<00:03:24.220> really<00:03:24.400> bother<00:03:24.730> at<00:03:25.030> all<00:03:25.319> he<00:03:26.319> has<00:03:26.500> a
