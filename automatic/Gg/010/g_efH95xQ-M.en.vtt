there<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.339> quite<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.639> bit<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.179> play<00:00:54.019> in<00:00:54.319> the

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
there is quite a bit of play in the

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:56.500 
there is quite a bit of play in the
front<00:00:54.739> wheels<00:00:54.979> as<00:00:55.249> I<00:00:55.370> wiggle<00:00:55.729> it<00:00:55.819> and<00:00:56.299> if<00:00:56.420> I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
front wheels as I wiggle it and if I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.789 
front wheels as I wiggle it and if I
isolate<00:00:56.719> one<00:00:57.379> wheel<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.979> wiggle<00:00:59.379> you<00:01:00.379> can<00:01:00.559> see

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
isolate one wheel and wiggle you can see

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.520 
isolate one wheel and wiggle you can see
here<00:01:01.249> that<00:01:01.519> most<00:01:01.729> of<00:01:01.999> that<00:01:02.030> play<00:01:02.479> is<00:01:03.139> coming

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
here that most of that play is coming

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.219 
here that most of that play is coming
from<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.010> bushing<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.630> steering<00:01:06.020> link

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
from the bushing and the steering link

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.940 
from the bushing and the steering link
setup<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.820> team<00:01:08.030> chase<00:01:08.390> has<00:01:08.799> come<00:01:09.799> up

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
setup and the team chase has come up

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.640 
setup and the team chase has come up
with<00:01:10.100> a<00:01:10.130> product<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.810> is<00:01:12.200> going<00:01:12.410> to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
with a product here that is going to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.460 
with a product here that is going to
eliminate<00:01:13.160> most<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.300> play<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.320> also

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
eliminate most of the play and is also

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.580 
eliminate most of the play and is also
going<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.920> be<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.250> superior<00:01:16.900> setup<00:01:17.900> as<00:01:18.050> far<00:01:18.320> as

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
going to be a superior setup as far as

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.370 
going to be a superior setup as far as
less<00:01:19.100> friction<00:01:19.720> let<00:01:20.720> me<00:01:20.810> go<00:01:20.930> ahead<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.170> take

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
less friction let me go ahead and take

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.650 
less friction let me go ahead and take
this<00:01:21.560> apart<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:21.980> we'll<00:01:22.130> do<00:01:22.310> some<00:01:22.670> or<00:01:23.060> take

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
this apart and we'll do some or take

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.880 
this apart and we'll do some or take
that<00:01:23.810> out<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.050> package<00:01:24.410> will<00:01:24.650> show<00:01:24.830> you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
that out of the package will show you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.000 
that out of the package will show you
some<00:01:25.160> close-ups<00:01:26.620> alright<00:01:27.620> we<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:27.890> it

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
some close-ups alright we have it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.850 
some close-ups alright we have it
removed<00:01:28.370> from<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.030> package<00:01:29.480> if<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.500> take<00:01:30.830> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
removed from the package if you take a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.900 
removed from the package if you take a
look<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.280> we're<00:01:31.370> gonna<00:01:31.430> do<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> little

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
look and we're gonna do a little

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.840 
look and we're gonna do a little
close-up<00:01:32.270> here<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.160> that<00:01:34.460> there<00:01:34.820> is

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
close-up here you can see that there is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.870 
close-up here you can see that there is
a<00:01:35.180> bearing<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:36.650> retained<00:01:37.250> in<00:01:37.490> there<00:01:37.670> with

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
a bearing that is retained in there with

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.730 
a bearing that is retained in there with
a<00:01:37.910> little<00:01:38.270> clip<00:01:39.760> rather<00:01:40.760> than<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.530> bushing<00:01:42.530> and

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
a little clip rather than a bushing and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.880 
a little clip rather than a bushing and
that's<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.420> bearing<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.930> going<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.320> give<00:01:45.530> us<00:01:45.680> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
that's the bearing is going to give us a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's the bearing is going to give us a
lot<00:01:46.760> smoother<00:01:47.540> back<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.560> forth<00:01:48.770> motion<00:01:49.100> you

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
lot smoother back and forth motion you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.710 
lot smoother back and forth motion you
can<00:01:50.210> see<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.690> it<00:01:50.870> is<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:51.080> flange<00:01:51.470> bearing<00:01:51.980> and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
can see that it is a flange bearing and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.410 
can see that it is a flange bearing and
it's<00:01:53.720> held<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.080> by<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.500> clip<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:54.980> front

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
it's held in by the clip on the front

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.160 
it's held in by the clip on the front
the<00:01:56.420> metal<00:01:57.610> bushings<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.970> are<00:01:59.330> included<00:01:59.900> in

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
the metal bushings that are included in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.280 
the metal bushings that are included in
the<00:02:00.409> Losi<00:02:01.190> have<00:02:01.820> been<00:02:02.120> replaced<00:02:02.630> with<00:02:03.050> a

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
the Losi have been replaced with a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.070 
the Losi have been replaced with a
plastic<00:02:03.950> or<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.250> nylon<00:02:04.700> bushing<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.479> some<00:02:05.690> sort

I<00:02:06.229> know<00:02:06.979> team<00:02:07.370> chase<00:02:07.670> well<00:02:07.909> enough<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.420> know

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
I know team chase well enough to know

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.410 
I know team chase well enough to know
that<00:02:09.319> they've<00:02:09.619> chosen<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.489> proper<00:02:10.849> material

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
that they've chosen the proper material

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.479 
that they've chosen the proper material
for<00:02:11.659> that<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.980> press<00:02:13.459> down

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
for that and that's going to press down

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.819 
for that and that's going to press down
inside<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:17.030> bearing<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.629> don't<00:02:18.620> really

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
inside of the bearing I don't really

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.580 
inside of the bearing I don't really
anticipate<00:02:19.549> much<00:02:19.760> wear<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.450> these

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
anticipate much wear on these

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.840 
anticipate much wear on these
because<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.490> rotating<00:02:23.020> inside<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
because it is rotating inside of a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.720 
because it is rotating inside of a
bearing<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.470> same<00:02:27.710> on<00:02:27.980> both<00:02:28.040> ends

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.030 
bearing and it's the same on both ends
so<00:02:28.910> basically<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.990> is<00:02:30.200> going<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.650> be<00:02:30.800> pretty

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
so basically this is going to be pretty

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.780 
so basically this is going to be pretty
much<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.850> drop-in<00:02:32.510> replacement<00:02:33.580> if<00:02:34.580> we

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
much just a drop-in replacement if we

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.230 
much just a drop-in replacement if we
take<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.030> look<00:02:35.270> at<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.840> sprues<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:38.030> are

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
take a look at the sprues that are

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
take a look at the sprues that are
included<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.170> kit<00:02:40.180> we'll<00:02:41.180> notice<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.630> it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
included in the kit we'll notice that it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.940 
included in the kit we'll notice that it
has<00:02:42.410> actually<00:02:42.920> been<00:02:43.460> worked<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> head<00:02:45.800> of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
has actually been worked on the head of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.010 
has actually been worked on the head of
this<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.310> actually<00:02:46.520> smaller<00:02:47.060> than<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.510> standard

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
this is actually smaller than a standard

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.700 
this is actually smaller than a standard
screw<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.670> they've<00:02:50.210> done<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.320> when

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
screw and they've done that so that when

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.870 
screw and they've done that so that when
it<00:02:51.860> fits<00:02:52.040> down<00:02:52.340> inside<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:55.250> unit<00:02:55.460> here

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
it fits down inside of the unit here

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.790 
it fits down inside of the unit here
that<00:02:56.060> it's<00:02:56.360> not<00:02:56.420> hitting<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.020> any<00:02:57.200> clips<00:02:57.620> or

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
that it's not hitting on any clips or

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.200 
that it's not hitting on any clips or
anything<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.400> will<00:02:58.670> need<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.000> make<00:02:59.180> sure

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
anything so you will need to make sure

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.170 
anything so you will need to make sure
that<00:02:59.720> you<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.530> use<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.100> team<00:03:01.400> chase<00:03:01.730> screws

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that you do use the team chase screws

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.320 
that you do use the team chase screws
that<00:03:02.960> came<00:03:03.200> with<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.970> one<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.180> other

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
that came with it one of the other

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.200 
that came with it one of the other
benefits<00:03:05.600> here<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.740> screw<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.880> going

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
benefits here is that the screw is going

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.490 
benefits here is that the screw is going
to<00:03:08.360> go<00:03:08.510> all<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.840> way<00:03:09.170> down<00:03:09.620> through<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
to go all the way down through the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.990 
to go all the way down through the
steering<00:03:12.500> arm<00:03:12.860> here<00:03:13.160> rather<00:03:13.400> than<00:03:13.550> just

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
steering arm here rather than just

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.480 
steering arm here rather than just
tapping<00:03:14.570> into<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.080> plastic<00:03:15.620> it's<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.430> to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
tapping into the plastic it's going to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.980 
tapping into the plastic it's going to
go<00:03:16.640> all<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.880> way<00:03:17.000> through<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.720> then<00:03:17.840> they

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
go all the way through and then they

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.520 
go all the way through and then they
also<00:03:18.140> supply<00:03:18.710> nuts<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.940> put<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.450> bottom<00:03:20.660> so

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
also supply nuts to put on the bottom so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.170 
also supply nuts to put on the bottom so
it's<00:03:21.710> actually<00:03:21.890> going<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.370> make<00:03:22.460> for<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.940> much

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
it's actually going to make for a much

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.020 
it's actually going to make for a much
more<00:03:23.210> secure<00:03:23.870> unit<00:03:24.110> as<00:03:24.410> well<00:03:25.070> as<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.370> smoother

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
more secure unit as well as a smoother

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.660 
more secure unit as well as a smoother
unit<00:03:26.540> with<00:03:26.690> less<00:03:26.900> play<00:03:27.440> we're<00:03:28.370> going<00:03:28.490> to<00:03:28.550> take

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
unit with less play we're going to take

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.430 
unit with less play we're going to take
a<00:03:28.700> few<00:03:28.970> minutes<00:03:29.240> here<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.510> install<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.110> so

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
a few minutes here and install this so

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.660 
a few minutes here and install this so
sit<00:03:31.310> back<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.670> relax<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:34.070> install<00:03:34.490> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
sit back and relax to install the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.860 
sit back and relax to install the
steering<00:03:35.920> unit<00:03:36.920> we<00:03:37.280> really<00:03:37.610> do<00:03:37.820> not<00:03:38.000> have<00:03:38.060> to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
steering unit we really do not have to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.400 
steering unit we really do not have to
remove<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:40.400> top<00:03:40.640> plate<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.150> here<00:03:41.420> however<00:03:41.990> I'm

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
remove the top plate on here however I'm

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.680 
remove the top plate on here however I'm
going<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.890> remove<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.520> just<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:44.510> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
going to remove it just so that it's a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.920 
going to remove it just so that it's a
little<00:03:44.990> bit<00:03:45.230> more<00:03:45.410> visible<00:03:45.650> for<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.940> video<00:03:47.240> I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
little bit more visible for the video I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.780 
little bit more visible for the video I
think<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.680> little<00:03:48.770> easier<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.190> work<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.640> as

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
think it's a little easier to work on as

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.460 
think it's a little easier to work on as
well<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.270> take<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.630> off<00:03:50.840> but<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
well when you take that off but the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.710 
well when you take that off but the
truth<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.190> matter<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.480> can

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
truth of the matter is is that you can

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.280 
truth of the matter is is that you can
leave<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.080> on<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.680> replace<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.250> unit<00:03:56.290> alright

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
leave it on to replace the unit alright

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.290 
leave it on to replace the unit alright
we've<00:03:57.470> removed<00:03:57.830> our<00:03:58.040> top<00:03:58.310> plate<00:03:58.490> here<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.090> now

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
we've removed our top plate here and now

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.480 
we've removed our top plate here and now
you<00:03:59.360> can<00:04:01.240> better<00:04:02.240> see<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.950> brace<00:04:03.950> here<00:04:04.220> that

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
you can better see the brace here that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.640 
you can better see the brace here that
we<00:04:04.610> are<00:04:04.730> replacing<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.630> it's<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.410> little

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
we are replacing and it's just a little

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.490 
we are replacing and it's just a little
easier<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.100> get<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.610> work<00:04:07.730> at<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.900> first

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
easier to get to and work at the first

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.470 
easier to get to and work at the first
thing<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.710> we're<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.190> do<00:04:10.490> is<00:04:11.030> to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
thing that we're going to do is to

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.930 
thing that we're going to do is to
remove<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.080> old<00:04:12.110> brace<00:04:12.590> there's<00:04:13.460> two<00:04:13.700> screws

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
remove the old brace there's two screws

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.800 
remove the old brace there's two screws
on<00:04:14.270> here

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.530 

very<00:04:17.810> simply<00:04:18.139> going<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.500> remove<00:04:18.769> them<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:20.329> you

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
there that it doesn't get lost just in

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.210 
there that it doesn't get lost just in
case<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.060> want<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.300> save<00:04:29.540> your<00:04:29.900> your<00:04:30.620> old<00:04:30.830> unit

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
the day but we're very simply going to

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.830 
the day but we're very simply going to
remove<00:04:40.340> those<00:04:40.850> two<00:04:41.150> units<00:04:43.450> we're<00:04:44.450> going<00:04:44.660> to

very<00:04:52.010> simply<00:04:53.229> going<00:04:54.229> to<00:04:54.290> make<00:04:54.440> sure<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.889> our

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
very simply going to make sure that our

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.820 
very simply going to make sure that our
little<00:04:55.550> grommets<00:04:56.330> are<00:04:56.479> in<00:04:56.630> there<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.020> we're

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
little grommets are in there and we're

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:08.560 
little grommets are in there and we're
going<00:04:58.130> to<00:05:00.610> screw<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.639> one<00:05:02.000> in<00:05:07.479> you're<00:05:08.479> going

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
going to screw this one in you're going

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.010 
going to screw this one in you're going
to<00:05:08.630> go<00:05:08.750> all<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:08.960> way<00:05:09.110> down<00:05:09.410> through<00:05:14.020> the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
to go all the way down through the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.140 
to go all the way down through the
steering<00:05:15.290> arm<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.100> we<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.520> put<00:05:16.729> our<00:05:16.940> nut

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
steering arm so that we can put our nut

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.960 
steering arm so that we can put our nut
on<00:05:17.360> there<00:05:17.540> get<00:05:18.200> back<00:05:18.350> on<00:05:18.530> there<00:05:18.729> so<00:05:19.729> that<00:05:19.760> we

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
on there get back on there so that we

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.790 
on there get back on there so that we
can<00:05:20.150> put<00:05:20.390> our<00:05:20.600> nut<00:05:20.840> on<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.350> bottom<00:05:21.680> which

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
can put our nut on to the bottom which

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.940 
can put our nut on to the bottom which
is<00:05:21.979> kind<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.400> hard<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.700> see<00:05:23.680> let's<00:05:24.680> go<00:05:24.740> ahead

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
is kind of hard to see let's go ahead

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:39.290 
is kind of hard to see let's go ahead
and<00:05:25.130> get<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.340> second<00:05:25.700> one<00:05:25.820> on<00:05:25.970> there

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:51.689 

seems<00:05:40.300> like<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.630> wiggle<00:05:40.840> around<00:05:50.580> screw<00:05:51.580> it

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
seems like to wiggle around screw it

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.689 
seems like to wiggle around screw it
down<00:05:51.820> till<00:05:52.150> it's<00:05:52.300> just<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.990> stunt<00:05:53.430> there<00:05:54.430> we<00:05:54.520> go

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
down till it's just a stunt there we go

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.210 
down till it's just a stunt there we go
that's<00:05:55.030> basically<00:05:55.449> how<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:56.139> unit<00:05:56.680> installs

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
that's basically how the unit installs

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.120 
that's basically how the unit installs
I'm<00:05:57.850> going<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.510> put<00:05:58.930> on<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.290> two<00:05:59.620> little<00:05:59.889> nuts

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
I'm going to put on the two little nuts

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.250 
I'm going to put on the two little nuts
that<00:06:00.460> back<00:06:00.699> the<00:06:00.970> bottom<00:06:01.150> up<00:06:01.479> here<00:06:01.750> not<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.169> we

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
that back the bottom up here not that we

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.409 
that back the bottom up here not that we
really<00:06:02.560> need<00:06:02.770> them<00:06:03.040> but<00:06:03.699> it's<00:06:03.850> always<00:06:04.000> best<00:06:04.300> to

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
really need them but it's always best to

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.500 
really need them but it's always best to
put<00:06:04.660> them<00:06:04.810> on<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:06.190> be<00:06:06.310> secure<00:06:06.760> and<00:06:06.940> then<00:06:07.419> we're

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
put them on to be secure and then we're

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.390 
put them on to be secure and then we're
gonna<00:06:07.600> put<00:06:07.840> our<00:06:07.960> top<00:06:08.169> plate<00:06:08.350> back<00:06:08.680> on<00:06:08.889> so<00:06:09.250> we'll

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
gonna put our top plate back on so we'll

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.080 
gonna put our top plate back on so we'll
be<00:06:09.520> right<00:06:09.669> back<00:06:10.139> well<00:06:11.139> we<00:06:11.169> make<00:06:11.550> made<00:06:12.550> quick

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
be right back well we make made quick

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.110 
be right back well we make made quick
meal<00:06:13.449> out<00:06:13.660> of<00:06:13.780> that<00:06:13.930> one<00:06:14.760> units<00:06:15.760> installed

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
meal out of that one units installed

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.500 
meal out of that one units installed
took<00:06:16.479> about<00:06:16.660> five<00:06:16.930> minutes<00:06:17.789> we<00:06:18.789> isolate<00:06:19.330> one

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
took about five minutes we isolate one

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.060 
took about five minutes we isolate one
of<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.690> wheels<00:06:19.930> here<00:06:20.289> and<00:06:20.440> you<00:06:20.500> can<00:06:20.620> check<00:06:20.860> out

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
of the wheels here and you can check out

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.659 
of the wheels here and you can check out
and<00:06:21.220> you<00:06:21.280> can<00:06:21.400> see<00:06:21.610> that<00:06:21.850> it's<00:06:22.630> really<00:06:23.669> gotten

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
and you can see that it's really gotten

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.300 
and you can see that it's really gotten
rid<00:06:24.850> of<00:06:25.000> a<00:06:25.210> lot<00:06:25.870> of<00:06:25.900> slop<00:06:26.500> that<00:06:26.530> was<00:06:26.949> in<00:06:27.130> this

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
rid of a lot of slop that was in this

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.390 
rid of a lot of slop that was in this
front<00:06:28.169> steering<00:06:29.169> assembly<00:06:29.470> which<00:06:29.800> is<00:06:30.010> going

front steering assembly which is going

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.710 
front steering assembly which is going
to<00:06:30.490> be<00:06:30.610> nice<00:06:30.789> I'm<00:06:31.030> sure<00:06:31.060> we'll<00:06:31.300> be<00:06:31.389> able<00:06:31.419> to

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
to be nice I'm sure we'll be able to

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.879 
to be nice I'm sure we'll be able to
feel<00:06:31.960> that<00:06:31.990> right<00:06:32.470> away<00:06:33.090> down<00:06:34.090> the<00:06:34.240> line<00:06:34.889> the

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
going to bend or break and then it's

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.180 
going to bend or break and then it's
possible<00:06:52.450> down<00:06:53.169> the<00:06:53.349> line<00:06:53.530> that<00:06:53.770> the<00:06:53.889> little

insert grommets can wear out and I'm

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.430 
insert grommets can wear out and I'm
sure<00:06:57.010> there'd<00:06:57.220> be<00:06:57.460> a<00:06:57.810> replacement<00:06:58.810> kit<00:06:59.229> for

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
sure there'd be a replacement kit for

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.879 
sure there'd be a replacement kit for
that<00:06:59.470> but<00:06:59.860> I<00:06:59.889> just<00:07:00.220> don't<00:07:00.430> see<00:07:00.669> that<00:07:00.700> happening

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889 
that but I just don't see that happening

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.730 
that but I just don't see that happening
very<00:07:02.889> quickly<00:07:03.039> or<00:07:03.580> often<00:07:04.180> or<00:07:04.330> at<00:07:04.570> all<00:07:04.780> because

very quickly or often or at all because

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.219 
very quickly or often or at all because
that<00:07:05.770> there's<00:07:06.669> just<00:07:06.820> no<00:07:07.030> load<00:07:07.330> on<00:07:07.630> that<00:07:07.660> on
