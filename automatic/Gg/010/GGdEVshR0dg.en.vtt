00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.090
 And then people, this is the return. 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.219
 of the video says alves 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.499
 I'll enjoy making a neighbor. 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.860
 We talk about what I think about the new 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:17.369
 even wanted to send a 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.759
 save promotes from 160 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.529
 we took two mice and recently 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.369
 I'm not going to say his name, let's go. 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.369
 see if he'll like it 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.200
 the first video 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:42.080
 I found it opened 160 as you could 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:45.320
 see and it was the odd sort of streak that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:49.370
 Like that, I realized he was 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.260
 coming in case of exhaust sound and neither 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.379
 I'll have a gap one down 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.820
 The way that I was accelerating, he came already. 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.320
 with the engine full and passed me 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.720
 I honestly did not think I took 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.180
 palmaz 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.100
 the rectors there do not keep saying ah that 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.620
 took Bahian admitted that in his time 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 there I took Paulo had no good 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.700
 evening 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.200
 in that I had the original exhaust 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.930
 then last chance after I 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.370
 put on a sports exhaust 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.370
 find to find that same guy 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 this same guy with that same 160 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.330
 this time from equal to equal after 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.480
 pass on a spring break the two left 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.480
 Monday he took the stick. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.380
 and it was very easy to get another one from him 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.630
 as happened with two other 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.090
 around 60 that I 've already met in 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.090
 street but unfortunately I was not filming 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.549
 so the wheel really innovated there 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.530
 with this new bike brought things like 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:14.260
 rear disc brake a digital dashboard 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.900
 down the bike a little bit changed the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.370
 design is a new 160-cylinder engine 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.390
 but so bro's not because I have to 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.040
 150 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.110
 but I still prefer my bike 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:38.010
 if someone gave me 160 to change into 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.010
 my not traded day zero as well 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.830
 it's about fred escudo well liked 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.610
 fred the front rear brake 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.150
 really brings a little more 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.220
 safety 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.810
 with respect to the lady panel made a 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.750
 dashboard but we beyond 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.720
 simple a very simple panel is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.689
 something I want has not put the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.310
 tachometer understood the only truth 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.709
 thing that I miss about my panel 1 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.629
 I do not mind those 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.040
 simple digital panel that way I 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:14.049
 I prefer my thanks to the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.170
 design the bike is more beautiful of the middle 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.680
 because the deep middle to 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.040
 she is much ugliest to me 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
 That's my opinion 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 and with respect to the motor 160 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.569
 O 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.599
 the guys already know that the cylinder capacity is not 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.599
 all but really 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.390
 any 150 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.970
 It is well- loved that it is the case of my 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.670
 easy handle opened 160 as you could 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.730
 see revenge 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.370
 my bike I did not do anything different 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.220
 in her engine I have not yet put the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.750
 beautiful of Avila and directed to your 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.920
 sports exhaust has nothing to do with 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.850
 different 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:13.450
 now the differential of my bike is 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:17.190
 the mapping why because I always 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.080
 I usually give everything the engine can give 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.680
 I'm tired in this one engine on the track I'm 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.330
 always with the hand in the corner in the city 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.129
 always with high rotation 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.689
 not in this case here now as to the 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:32.750
 lady bns the pilot with a little more 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:36.110
 of care but there is yes you can see the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.340
 bike is new she has five thousand 572 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.699
 kilometers 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.680
 the bike is very new now it was 5 thousand 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:48.050
 Intense kilometers 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.909
 understood I traveled a lot early in the morning 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.110
 so what happens I get a clue 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:56.150
 Empty then in the hand in the corner all the time 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.050
 euro would decelerate the bike to make the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.270
 curves is 1 850 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.680
 I can not do the good curves and the 120 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.680
 and 130 and 135 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.770
 so this is what happens 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.220
 the people who like and play 11 de paulo 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.430
 face for none is clear on the video 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.870
 laman left the two did not break spring of 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.210
 Monday 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.780
 My bike from the second gir gave me 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.810
 one caught with the game is already the third 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.140
 she impelled me I finished passing 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.140
 bros 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.970
 An a 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.380
 then the really issue of softening 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.270
 I'm sure when they find it opened 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.270
 160 well advanced she'll give me work 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 beauty 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.770
 this was what I wanted to talk to 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.770
 you
