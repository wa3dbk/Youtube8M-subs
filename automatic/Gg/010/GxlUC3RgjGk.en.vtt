00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
as devastated as we were four years ago
I<00:00:45.329> mean<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> city<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.289> rocked<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> fan<00:00:47.129> base

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I mean the city was rocked the fan base

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
I mean the city was rocked the fan base
was<00:00:47.640> rocked<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.469> were

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
was rocked it really was like we were

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.740 
was rocked it really was like we were
kicked<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> NBA<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.239> couple<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
kicked out of the NBA for a couple of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
kicked out of the NBA for a couple of
years<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> Cavaliers<00:00:53.280> were<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.789> just

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
years because the Cavaliers were so just

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
years because the Cavaliers were so just
empty<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> cupboard<00:00:55.710> once<00:00:55.920> he<00:00:56.100> left<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.879> i

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
empty in the cupboard once he left but i

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.700 
empty in the cupboard once he left but i
think<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.420> they've<00:00:57.780> righted<00:00:58.170> themselves

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
think really they've righted themselves

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260 
think really they've righted themselves
they<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> lot<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.190> young<00:00:59.460> talent<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.090> would

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
they got a lot of young talent it would

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.599 
they got a lot of young talent it would
be<00:01:00.420> great<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.289> him<00:01:01.350> back<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.430> make

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
be great to have him back it would make

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.729 
be great to have him back it would make
them<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:02.969> instant<00:01:03.539> contender<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.500> win<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
them an instant contender to win the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.380 
them an instant contender to win the
Eastern<00:01:05.100> Conference<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> doesn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
Eastern Conference but if it doesn't

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
Eastern Conference but if it doesn't
happen<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.070> as

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
happen I don't think they would be as

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
happen I don't think they would be as
devastated<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.420> don't<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> fans

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
devastated and I don't think the fans

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
devastated and I don't think the fans
would<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.640> irate<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.420> were

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
