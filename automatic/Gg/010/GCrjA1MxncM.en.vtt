00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
with a new harmonica instruction video

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.720 
with a new harmonica instruction video
for<00:00:28.520> you<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:28.910> I<00:00:29.450> am<00:00:29.599> playing<00:00:29.869> on<00:00:30.340> this<00:00:31.340> video

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
for you and I am playing on this video

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.910 
for you and I am playing on this video
for<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.450> first<00:00:32.599> time<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:32.960> different<00:00:33.530> key<00:00:33.680> I'm

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
for the first time a different key I'm

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.330 
for the first time a different key I'm
playing<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.880> G<00:00:35.090> harmonica<00:00:35.720> which<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
playing a G harmonica which is the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.599 
playing a G harmonica which is the
lowest<00:00:37.760> harmonica<00:00:38.980> although<00:00:39.980> they<00:00:40.129> come<00:00:40.370> much

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
lowest harmonica although they come much

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.479 
lowest harmonica although they come much
lower<00:00:40.969> it's<00:00:41.840> sort<00:00:42.230> of<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.530> most<00:00:42.829> standard<00:00:43.160> ly

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
lower it's sort of the most standard ly

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.549 
lower it's sort of the most standard ly
thought<00:00:44.030> of<00:00:44.210> as<00:00:44.359> being<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.719> lowest<00:00:45.050> key<00:00:45.260> or

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
thought of as being the lowest key or

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.229 
thought of as being the lowest key or
low<00:00:46.160> F<00:00:46.449> maybe<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:49.129> reason<00:00:49.519> I'm<00:00:49.640> playing<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.030> G

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
low F maybe the reason I'm playing the G

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.150 
low F maybe the reason I'm playing the G
right<00:00:50.480> now<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.839> because<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.260> want<00:00:51.589> to<00:00:51.679> introduce

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
right now is because I want to introduce

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.380 
right now is because I want to introduce

the subject of blow bends let's see here
when<00:01:12.979> we're<00:01:13.100> talking<00:01:13.250> about<00:01:13.520> blow<00:01:13.939> bends

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
when we're talking about blow bends

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.230 
when we're talking about blow bends
we're<00:01:14.509> going<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.780> be<00:01:14.899> talking<00:01:15.140> about<00:01:16.240> holes

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
we're going to be talking about holes

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.999 
we're going to be talking about holes
seven<00:01:18.229> eight<00:01:18.649> nine<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.970> ten<00:01:20.590> those<00:01:21.590> are<00:01:21.890> the

seven eight nine and ten those are the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.940 
seven eight nine and ten those are the
holes<00:01:22.250> which<00:01:23.090> we<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:23.659> bend<00:01:24.290> when<00:01:24.740> we're

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
holes which we can bend when we're

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.399 
holes which we can bend when we're
blowing<00:01:25.340> I'm<00:01:25.969> not<00:01:26.210> talking<00:01:26.540> about<00:01:26.600> over<00:01:27.170> blows

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
blowing I'm not talking about over blows

well as anything having to do with the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.069 
well as anything having to do with the
harmonica<00:01:40.390> definitely<00:01:41.390> check<00:01:41.600> out<00:01:41.719> Howard

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
harmonica definitely check out Howard

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.410 
harmonica definitely check out Howard
levy<00:01:42.280> University<00:01:43.280> if<00:01:43.670> you're<00:01:43.880> interested<00:01:44.270> in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
levy University if you're interested in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.910 
levy University if you're interested in
exploring<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.049> harmonica<00:01:46.869> more<00:01:47.869> deeply<00:01:48.259> okay

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
exploring the harmonica more deeply okay

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.170 
exploring the harmonica more deeply okay
so<00:01:49.280> we've<00:01:49.640> got<00:01:49.670> hole<00:01:50.060> 7<00:01:50.509> 8<00:01:50.750> 9<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.109> 10<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.430> just

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
so we've got hole 7 8 9 and 10 and just

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.810 
so we've got hole 7 8 9 and 10 and just
like<00:01:53.420> with<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.719> draw<00:01:54.140> bends<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.369> blow<00:01:55.579> bends

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
like with the draw bends the blow bends

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.690 
like with the draw bends the blow bends
how<00:01:56.270> far<00:01:56.539> we<00:01:56.689> can<00:01:56.840> bend<00:01:57.079> down<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.670> dictated<00:01:58.670> by

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
how far we can bend down is dictated by

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.700 
how far we can bend down is dictated by
the<00:01:58.909> interval<00:01:59.570> between<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.020> draw<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the interval between the draw and the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.990 
the interval between the draw and the
blow<00:02:00.890> bends<00:02:01.280> okay<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:01.899> in<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.170> case<00:02:03.939> on<00:02:04.939> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
blow bends okay so in this case on a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.139 
blow bends okay so in this case on a
standard<00:02:05.570> Li<00:02:05.689> tuned<00:02:05.960> diatonic<00:02:06.920> harmonica<00:02:07.520> we

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
standard Li tuned diatonic harmonica we

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.350 
standard Li tuned diatonic harmonica we
can<00:02:08.390> bend<00:02:08.690> hole<00:02:09.200> number<00:02:09.440> seven<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.670> half

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
can bend hole number seven down a half

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.920 
can bend hole number seven down a half
step<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:12.890> can<00:02:13.100> bend<00:02:13.400> hole<00:02:13.910> number<00:02:14.180> eight<00:02:14.540> down

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
step we can bend hole number eight down

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.670 
step we can bend hole number eight down
a<00:02:15.260> half<00:02:15.770> step<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.840> can

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
a half step we can

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.399 
a half step we can
and<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:19.159> whole<00:02:19.489> number<00:02:19.730> nine<00:02:20.060> down<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.810> half<00:02:21.200> step

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
and a whole number nine down a half step

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.000 
and a whole number nine down a half step
and<00:02:21.769> we<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:22.969> both<00:02:23.239> bend<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.200> whole<00:02:24.379> number<00:02:24.620> ten

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and we can both bend a whole number ten

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.599 
and we can both bend a whole number ten
down<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.549> whole<00:02:25.760> step<00:02:25.939> that's<00:02:26.659> the<00:02:26.959> one<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
down a whole step that's the one so that

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.729 
down a whole step that's the one so that
you<00:02:28.879> there's<00:02:29.659> two<00:02:29.840> different<00:02:30.019> positions<00:02:30.560> that

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
you there's two different positions that

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.699 
you there's two different positions that
you<00:02:30.859> can<00:02:30.890> bend<00:02:31.250> into<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:32.540> hole<00:02:32.900> number<00:02:32.930> ten<00:02:33.469> and

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
you can bend into on hole number ten and

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.559 
you can bend into on hole number ten and
the<00:02:34.400> technique<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.819> we<00:02:35.150> are<00:02:35.269> going<00:02:35.420> to

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
the technique that we are going to

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.569 
the technique that we are going to
implement<00:02:36.049> for<00:02:36.139> our<00:02:36.620> blow<00:02:36.859> bends<00:02:37.219> is<00:02:37.340> just

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
implement for our blow bends is just

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.869 
implement for our blow bends is just
exactly<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.329> reverse<00:02:38.889> as<00:02:39.889> we've<00:02:40.280> been<00:02:40.519> doing

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
exactly the reverse as we've been doing

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.890 
exactly the reverse as we've been doing
for<00:02:41.510> our<00:02:41.750> draw<00:02:42.049> bends<00:02:42.469> so<00:02:43.250> when<00:02:43.670> we<00:02:43.790> did<00:02:43.939> when

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
for our draw bends so when we did when

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.569 
for our draw bends so when we did when
we<00:02:44.930> learned<00:02:45.230> draw<00:02:45.500> bends<00:02:45.829> we<00:02:46.189> talked<00:02:46.430> about

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
we learned draw bends we talked about

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.479 
we learned draw bends we talked about
Val<00:02:47.090> shape<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.230> released<00:02:48.560> position<00:02:49.129> drawing

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
Val shape in a released position drawing

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.759 
Val shape in a released position drawing
e<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.329> then<00:02:50.840> when<00:02:50.989> we<00:02:51.109> want<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.409> bend<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.739> down

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
e and then when we want to bend it down

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.789 
e and then when we want to bend it down
going<00:02:52.280> into<00:02:52.489> all<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.599> making<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.409> back

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
going into all and making the the back

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.729 
going into all and making the the back
of<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.069> mouth<00:02:55.250> really<00:02:55.579> big<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.409> case

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
of the mouth really big in this case

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.979 
of the mouth really big in this case
it's<00:02:58.489> just<00:02:58.549> that<00:02:58.909> it's<00:02:59.239> just<00:02:59.419> the<00:02:59.540> opposite

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
it's just that it's just the opposite

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.740 
it's just that it's just the opposite
would<00:03:00.139> be<00:03:00.200> more<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.680> all<00:03:00.859> kind<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.000> vowel

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
would be more in a all kind of vowel

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.490 
would be more in a all kind of vowel
shapes<00:03:03.079> when<00:03:03.560> we're<00:03:03.739> released<00:03:04.840> on<00:03:05.840> an<00:03:06.079> upper

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
shapes when we're released on an upper

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.729 
shapes when we're released on an upper
blow<00:03:07.010> note<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:08.079> then<00:03:09.079> we're<00:03:09.409> actually<00:03:09.530> going

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
blow note and then we're actually going

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.119 
blow note and then we're actually going
to<00:03:09.889> go<00:03:09.980> more<00:03:10.159> into<00:03:10.219> a<00:03:10.459> ye<00:03:11.049> kind<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.169> a<00:03:12.260> sound<00:03:12.500> so

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
to go more into a ye kind of a sound so

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.479 
to go more into a ye kind of a sound so
the<00:03:13.790> back<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.590> tongue<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.799> going<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.189> rise

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the back of the tongue is going to rise

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.709 
the back of the tongue is going to rise
up<00:03:18.219> against<00:03:19.219> the<00:03:19.340> roof<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.669> the<00:03:19.760> mouth<00:03:19.909> which

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:20.719 
up against the roof of the mouth which

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.140 
up against the roof of the mouth which
changes<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.469> direction<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:23.000> airflow

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
changes the direction of the airflow

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.149 
changes the direction of the airflow
down<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.810> believe<00:03:24.699> so<00:03:25.699> let's<00:03:26.599> see<00:03:26.810> here<00:03:27.159> let's

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
down I believe so let's see here let's

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.909 
down I believe so let's see here let's
start<00:03:28.340> with<00:03:28.790> hole<00:03:29.359> number<00:03:29.569> seven<00:03:30.169> so<00:03:30.799> I'm

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
start with hole number seven so I'm

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.020 
start with hole number seven so I'm
going<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.099> slide<00:03:31.310> from<00:03:31.489> ten<00:03:33.459> there<00:03:34.459> seven<00:03:34.819> ten

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
going to slide from ten there seven ten

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.900 
going to slide from ten there seven ten
nine<00:03:35.510> eight<00:03:35.870> seven

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.120 

I'm<00:03:39.910> sorry<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:42.960> misspoke<00:03:44.020> vii<00:03:44.470> cannot<00:03:44.800> go<00:03:44.950> down

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
I'm sorry I misspoke vii cannot go down

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.070 
I'm sorry I misspoke vii cannot go down
a<00:03:45.190> half<00:03:45.640> step<00:03:45.820> seven<00:03:46.360> can<00:03:46.540> only<00:03:46.690> go<00:03:46.900> down<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
a half step seven can only go down a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.280 
a half step seven can only go down a
quarter<00:03:47.440> step<00:03:47.650> because<00:03:48.580> seven<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.300> only<00:03:50.080> a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
quarter step because seven is only a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.990 
quarter step because seven is only a
half<00:03:50.590> step<00:03:50.620> oh<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.190> seven<00:03:51.490> blow<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.730> only<00:03:51.910> a

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
half step oh the seven blow is only a

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.240 
half step oh the seven blow is only a
half<00:03:52.180> step<00:03:52.450> higher<00:03:52.630> than<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.200> seven<00:03:53.830> draw<00:03:54.010> so

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
half step higher than the seven draw so

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.790 
half step higher than the seven draw so
that<00:03:54.400> one<00:03:54.550> only<00:03:54.700> has<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.910> quarter<00:03:55.210> step<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:55.960> we

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
that one only has a quarter step so we

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.770 
that one only has a quarter step so we
really<00:03:57.190> have<00:03:57.340> only<00:03:57.490> three<00:03:57.910> holes<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.480> we<00:03:58.600> can

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
really have only three holes that we can

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.920 
really have only three holes that we can
actually<00:03:58.990> do<00:03:59.530> blow<00:04:00.250> bends<00:04:00.610> on<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.750> is

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
actually do blow bends on and that is

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.450 
actually do blow bends on and that is
eight<00:04:02.110> nine<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.320> ten<00:04:02.650> eight<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:02.980> nine<00:04:03.310> are

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
eight nine and ten eight and nine are

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.520 
eight nine and ten eight and nine are
both<00:04:03.610> half<00:04:03.850> steps<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.450> ten<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:04.960> a<00:04:04.990> whole<00:04:05.260> step

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
both half steps and ten is a whole step

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.760 
both half steps and ten is a whole step
okay<00:04:06.460> so<00:04:07.450> let's<00:04:07.690> start<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.050> hole<00:04:08.260> number<00:04:08.500> eight

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
okay so let's start on hole number eight

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.530 
okay so let's start on hole number eight
there's<00:04:11.770> hole<00:04:11.920> number<00:04:12.040> eight

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.410 

heee<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.890> back<00:04:22.100> of<00:04:22.250> my<00:04:22.340> tongue<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.700> going<00:04:22.940> up

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
heee the back of my tongue is going up

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.010 
heee the back of my tongue is going up
against<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.430> roof<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.850> my<00:04:26.030> mouth<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.480> the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
against the the roof of my mouth and the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:42.750 
against the the roof of my mouth and the
front<00:04:27.230> of<00:04:27.290> my<00:04:27.380> tongue<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.800> let<00:04:28.310> me<00:04:28.430> see<00:04:28.550> that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.770 

the<00:04:43.760> front<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.030> my<00:04:44.060> mouth<00:04:44.240> is<00:04:44.450> not<00:04:44.600> really

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
the front of my mouth is not really

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.120 
the front of my mouth is not really
doing<00:04:44.930> anything<00:04:45.260> but<00:04:45.380> one<00:04:45.530> thing<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.770> noticed

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
doing anything but one thing I noticed

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.210 
doing anything but one thing I noticed
is<00:04:46.220> my<00:04:46.250> jaw<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.940> closing<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.870> little<00:04:48.140> bit<00:04:48.290> so<00:04:48.980> my

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
is my jaw is closing a little bit so my

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.910 
is my jaw is closing a little bit so my
jaw<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.640> little<00:04:49.910> bit<00:04:50.030> more<00:04:50.180> open<00:04:50.740> when<00:04:51.740> I'm

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
jaw is a little bit more open when I'm

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.400 
jaw is a little bit more open when I'm
bending<00:04:52.220> in<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.400> release<00:04:52.960> pin<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.080> release

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
bending in the release pin the release

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.750 
bending in the release pin the release
position<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.040> then<00:04:55.130> when<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.280> want<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.580> bend

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
position and then when I want to bend

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.450 
position and then when I want to bend
down<00:04:55.970> my<00:04:56.900> jaw<00:04:57.170> is<00:04:57.350> closing<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.920> bit<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.310> then

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
down my jaw is closing a bit and then

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.120 
down my jaw is closing a bit and then
again<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.030> back<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.780> tongue<00:05:00.020> is<00:05:00.290> coming

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
again the back of the tongue is coming

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.400 
again the back of the tongue is coming
up<00:05:01.280> towards<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.790> roof<00:05:01.940> of<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.240> mouth<00:05:02.360> just<00:05:02.690> as

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
up towards the roof of the mouth just as

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.720 
up towards the roof of the mouth just as
with<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.590> blow<00:05:03.860> bends<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.520> going<00:05:04.670> to

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
with the blow bends this is going to

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.720 
with the blow bends this is going to
require<00:05:05.030> patience<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.780> practice<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:07.400> don't<00:05:07.610> be

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
require patience in practice so don't be

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.640 
require patience in practice so don't be
frustrated<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.570> remember<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.020> took<00:05:09.140> me<00:05:09.320> several

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
frustrated I remember it took me several

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.250 
frustrated I remember it took me several
weeks<00:05:09.970> before<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.210> was<00:05:11.300> able<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.780> start<00:05:12.080> getting

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
weeks before I was able to start getting

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.790 
weeks before I was able to start getting
the<00:05:12.470> blow<00:05:12.650> bends<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.450> but<00:05:14.450> they<00:05:14.660> really<00:05:15.230> are<00:05:15.470> a

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
the blow bends and but they really are a

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.910 
the blow bends and but they really are a
lot<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.580> fun<00:05:16.850> once<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.870> begin<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.350> master<00:05:18.530> them

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
lot of fun once you begin to master them

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.860 
lot of fun once you begin to master them
okay<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:19.670> let's<00:05:19.940> move<00:05:20.120> on<00:05:20.300> now<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.540> hole<00:05:20.840> number

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
okay so let's move on now to hole number

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:38.320 
okay so let's move on now to hole number
nine

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.300 

okay<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:39.900> both<00:05:40.139> of<00:05:40.169> those<00:05:40.410> holes<00:05:40.770> eight<00:05:41.070> and

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
okay so both of those holes eight and

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.909 
okay so both of those holes eight and
hole<00:05:41.430> nine<00:05:41.639> we<00:05:41.910> can<00:05:42.090> do<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.510> half<00:05:42.990> step<00:05:43.320> again

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
hole nine we can do a half step again

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.550 
hole nine we can do a half step again
the<00:05:44.070> reason<00:05:44.340> I'm<00:05:44.430> using<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:44.910> G<00:05:45.320> harmonica<00:05:46.320> oh

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
the reason I'm using the G harmonica oh

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.320 
the reason I'm using the G harmonica oh
my<00:05:47.070> ears<00:05:47.250> are<00:05:47.460> bringing<00:05:47.760> that's<00:05:47.910> kind<00:05:48.150> of<00:05:48.210> like

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
my ears are bringing that's kind of like

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.050 
my ears are bringing that's kind of like
high-pitched<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:49.740> reason<00:05:50.070> I'm<00:05:50.220> using<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.940> is

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
high-pitched the reason I'm using it is

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.920 
high-pitched the reason I'm using it is
because<00:05:51.360> it's<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.570> lowest<00:05:52.040> as<00:05:53.040> you<00:05:53.630> get<00:05:54.630> to

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
because it's the lowest as you get to

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.110 
because it's the lowest as you get to
the<00:05:55.380> higher<00:05:55.590> harmonicas<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.550> blow<00:05:56.730> bends

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
the higher harmonicas the blow bends

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.610 
the higher harmonicas the blow bends
become<00:05:57.480> a<00:05:57.510> little<00:05:57.750> bit<00:05:57.900> more<00:05:57.960> difficult<00:05:58.560> to

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
become a little bit more difficult to

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.100 
become a little bit more difficult to
execute<00:05:58.730> because<00:05:59.730> they<00:05:59.970> require<00:06:00.630> a<00:06:00.660> more

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
execute because they require a more

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.440 
execute because they require a more
subtle<00:06:01.380> motion<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.389> lower<00:06:03.630> harmonica<00:06:04.410> is

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
subtle motion so the lower harmonica is

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.930 
subtle motion so the lower harmonica is
you<00:06:06.450> know<00:06:06.570> like<00:06:07.580> when<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:08.669> start<00:06:08.850> getting

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
you know like when you start getting

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.450 
you know like when you start getting
above<00:06:09.300> d<00:06:09.600> starts<00:06:10.290> getting<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.530> little<00:06:10.560> shrill<00:06:11.220> D

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
above d starts getting a little shrill D

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.240 
above d starts getting a little shrill D

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
low F to D or E flat are going to be the

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.719 
low F to D or E flat are going to be the

example<00:06:21.080> boy<00:06:22.080> it's<00:06:22.320> really<00:06:22.410> gets<00:06:22.800> shrill<00:06:23.040> up

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
example boy it's really gets shrill up

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.400 
example boy it's really gets shrill up
there<00:06:23.400> and<00:06:23.490> it's<00:06:23.610> really<00:06:23.820> hard<00:06:24.410> specifically

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
there and it's really hard specifically

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.710 
there and it's really hard specifically
on<00:06:25.979> the<00:06:26.160> ten<00:06:26.370> blow<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.790> ten<00:06:27.000> blow<00:06:27.240> is<00:06:27.450> the

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
on the ten blow the ten blow is the

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.190 
on the ten blow the ten blow is the
hardest<00:06:28.320> one<00:06:28.440> to<00:06:28.680> master<00:06:29.070> in<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.310> sense<00:06:29.520> that

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
hardest one to master in the sense that

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.040 
hardest one to master in the sense that
we<00:06:31.200> have<00:06:31.440> two<00:06:32.100> positions<00:06:32.419> that<00:06:33.419> we<00:06:33.600> can<00:06:33.810> bend

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
we have two positions that we can bend

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.879 
we have two positions that we can bend
on<00:06:34.350> the<00:06:34.470> ten<00:06:34.680> blow<00:06:34.950> and<00:06:35.570> the<00:06:36.570> half<00:06:36.780> step<00:06:37.169> just

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
on the ten blow and the half step just

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.270 
on the ten blow and the half step just
as<00:06:38.190> the<00:06:38.580> same<00:06:38.790> as<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:40.229> three<00:06:40.650> draw<00:06:40.889> perhaps

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
as the same as the three draw perhaps

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.400 
as the same as the three draw perhaps
the<00:06:41.520> one<00:06:41.669> in<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:41.910> middle<00:06:42.120> is<00:06:42.450> harder<00:06:43.200> to<00:06:43.229> get

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
the one in the middle is harder to get

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.540 
the one in the middle is harder to get
than<00:06:43.590> the<00:06:43.680> one<00:06:43.830> that's<00:06:43.919> all<00:06:44.100> the<00:06:44.130> way<00:06:44.250> bent

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
than the one that's all the way bent

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.240 
than the one that's all the way bent
down<00:06:44.870> so<00:06:45.870> let's<00:06:46.080> start<00:06:46.470> by<00:06:46.680> just<00:06:46.919> trying<00:06:47.070> to

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
down so let's start by just trying to

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:59.280 
down so let's start by just trying to
bend<00:06:47.610> the<00:06:48.270> ten<00:06:48.600> blow<00:06:49.050> down<00:06:49.380> a<00:06:49.410> whole<00:06:49.800> step

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.480 

okay<00:07:00.100> now<00:07:00.790> if<00:07:01.090> we<00:07:01.270> want<00:07:01.480> to<00:07:01.570> release<00:07:02.230> that<00:07:02.590> once

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
okay now if we want to release that once

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.640 
okay now if we want to release that once
you<00:07:03.610> get<00:07:03.730> it<00:07:03.850> down<00:07:04.030> into<00:07:04.270> the<00:07:04.450> position<00:07:05.140> slowly

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
you get it down into the position slowly

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.410 
you get it down into the position slowly
start<00:07:06.130> releasing<00:07:06.370> up<00:07:06.670> and<00:07:06.880> see<00:07:07.030> if<00:07:07.150> you<00:07:07.270> can

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
start releasing up and see if you can

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.900 
start releasing up and see if you can
get<00:07:07.570> it<00:07:07.690> to<00:07:07.810> pop<00:07:08.020> into<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:09.400> half-step

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
get it to pop into the half-step

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:18.900 
get it to pop into the half-step
position<00:07:10.300> in<00:07:10.420> between<00:07:10.750> them<00:07:10.870> so<00:07:17.610> you<00:07:18.610> hear<00:07:18.880> it

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
position in between them so you hear it

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:31.540 
position in between them so you hear it
yeah<00:07:19.390> man<00:07:20.200> and<00:07:25.950> again

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.550 

okay<00:07:32.550> that's<00:07:32.760> a<00:07:32.880> lot<00:07:33.030> of<00:07:33.090> uh<00:07:33.290> that's<00:07:34.290> a<00:07:34.380> lot<00:07:34.500> of

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 
okay that's a lot of uh that's a lot of

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.920 
okay that's a lot of uh that's a lot of
shrill<00:07:34.950> sounds<00:07:35.550> so<00:07:35.790> I<00:07:36.210> think<00:07:36.510> we<00:07:36.720> should<00:07:36.900> end
