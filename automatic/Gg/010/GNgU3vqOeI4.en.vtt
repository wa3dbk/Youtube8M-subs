00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
 teaching how to make a baby cry was 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.660
 babi 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 so come on good, what will you do? 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.660
 need is ivory of dough 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.730
 multi-color modeling 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.519
 this one has my orange orange 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.519
 black january ball 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 fine 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.640
 you do not need a pencil or 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.149
 pen to make the shortcuts is and is only 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.540
 happy when you will learn but I will 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 I'm intending to use a frog and we 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.090
 over there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.210
 the first thing I 'm going to do is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.460
 and I 'm going to do it, I'll do it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 pick up a little bit big presence 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 a piece of the clay and I'll make a 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.460
 60s ball 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 We had a small shop. 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.689
 Now let's get a little bit 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.110
 from there and we will know if the body 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.750
 lose traffic 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.369
 now you're going to take a bigger ball 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.380
 that the head has to be at the time of 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.990
 head after being smaller 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 the book also brings a little bigger goes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 to roll 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.619
 It is recommended that this little ball 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 You get the largest one of another color to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.290
 look more beautiful and I'll get one more 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.290
 little piece of good 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.630
 and here is going to be the baby's trunk 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.200
 now I'm going to make the little things this 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.770
 Baby, what I'm going to do, I 'll get one. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.190
 and I'll roll up and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.869
 piss 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.869
 It can not be very big, there are people. 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.130
 what is this when I have my goal 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 always let me love you, go and get it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.110
 This part here enters nothing here but to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:30.300
 party was 90 I can be you see this 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:33.450
 like what it seems sometimes it gets 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.630
 sitting next to the mother to get bigger 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.400
 what else is there and leaves a little aside 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.840
 now I'll do my legs to wait 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.820
 do not stay a little longer there 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.190
 to make the recordings a little bit 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:56.269
 legs should be the same way and now 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.269
 I'll do another one 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.310
 I really liked this idea, I think 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:08.400
 is right there you know not consider 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:12.019
 The result is to stay and now I go 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.019
 Check if you were frying in the morning 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.280
 now they just go see is to make eyes and 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.220
 mouth was on his head wearing it 's a 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.780
 toothpick or eat take pips one 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.730
 I'll pay for myself and now I'll make a 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.459
 young lady your income and also do 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:42.209
 rhythm us I do not know already 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.910
 they made some video on YouTube 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.070
 but I never told anyone about your idea 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.690
 OK 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.430
 I was playing with these days. 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.859
 my colleague and then they say that this old 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.769
 He languished in clay and I had to 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.970
 to know that the other side was thus 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.750
 his little head 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.760
 now I'm going to act like a 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.690
 a neckline is is nÃ© nuno sardinha will stay 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.690
 like this one blouse 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:27.750
 now let it ride a little face I 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:29.400
 I'm going over here like this. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.840
 something goes wrong we do not have 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:38.970
 problem if they find out in order to 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.860
 a little bit more for china this year 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.130
 it's looking like the shirt 6 I do not know if 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.650
 the camera is working at zero 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:52.500
 Now we go to his little arms. 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.090
 that the next will sit very powerful 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.860
 and proof of any proceeding has already been thus 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:09.860
 his clothes bank was bankrupt. 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:15.110
 And then my body I know is if 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.110
 touch is great and even tiny people 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.020
 My, you know it's too big. 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.360
 may morishita my opinion that 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:38.060
 he fell in love with a little space 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.060
 graphite a baby so strong decreasing 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.330
 to stay the most ideal 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.729
 I will not edit this video yet cause 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.210
 nothing because then I want you to 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:02.560
 follow step by step how I am 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:06.280
 doing this little baby and now it's joined 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.039
 his legs are lord and now he was the 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.599
 I'm going to do here is low 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.650
 so I'm going to put a little bit here in the 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:21.039
 my desk that cra is leaving the mouse 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:24.430
 with us it 's good to know the lines one 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:29.080
 A little bigger than you want to 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:32.979
 fly because then the one part will stay 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:39.330
 Down here it 's ready. 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:43.120

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.409
 I do not know if I can see it here I go 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.889
 Take plenty to show you how it is. 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.889
 the order 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:07:04.190

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:13.759

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:20.720

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:23.830
 I get there and cuddly then that's okay 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.830
