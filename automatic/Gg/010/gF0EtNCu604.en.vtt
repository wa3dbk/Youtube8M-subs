00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:08.850
 Hello, all friends, how are you doing well? 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:11.969
 this time we are going to see the recording 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.980
 with a microphone a narration in a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.790
 video that I already have here uploaded to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.210
 mobile maker 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.650
 in this case it is a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.689
 an essay so we can see how it is recorded 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.059
 a narration this video that I have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.450
 here has already uploaded to the mobile that does not have 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.400
 sound 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.700
 that is to remove the ambient sound as 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.550
 we had seen in other videos good 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.290
 when you want to record a narration or 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.800
 is explain what happens inside 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.790
 this the video has to be exposed 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.620
 on the mobile 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.350
 that is, we will not be able to record if here 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 there is nothing to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.690
 in what to record then the video is what 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 which makes a clue so that one can 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 record the narration another point to have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.800
 in mind to record a narration to a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.040
 video is in principle to come here 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.950
 about movi maiker and here in audio and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.229
 video have to have selected the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.050
 type of microphone that they will use and that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.869
 is configured for the occasion in this 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.890
 case I have this usb microphone 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.409
 so once I have that, I give it to 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.409
 accept and I'm ready to record a 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.060
 narration with my microphone 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.210
 so when I'm ready, I come 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 here 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.330
 and record a ration I will leave this 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.040
 the record button stop and cancel and 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.290
 when I give it to record I can start 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.470
 to narrate what I want to tell in my 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.930
 video if I'm wrong I come here to 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.230
 cancel or stop 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.530
 I delete what appears here and always with 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.600
 the right click remove 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.610
 and I start again until I get out 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 well I'm going to rehearse anything in 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.340
 this moment for her to see how 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.580

 I am from when they stop me on the route 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.310
 He approached some town but there was nobody 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.660
 I turn the camera backwards without stopping 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 look to the front to see what I have 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.500
 they are donations for a chapel 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.129
 nothing the trip is nice I'm calm 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.500
 I'm comfortable as soon as I find a 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.890
 city where to stop 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.690

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.070
 greeting 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.260
 I give it to stop once the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.050
 narration that mine was a disaster 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.090
 but good 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.310
 once I have that I give it to stop 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 This little window is going to come out for me 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.220
 I kept my narration, I'm going to put it 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 example in the car 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.000
 by name 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.859
 well I give in keeping good as I already 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 I had practiced this before I put him 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.769
 to replace it 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.790
 they keep it on my desk here 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.090
 because I tell him to keep in the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.500
 desk and in turn I add it here 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.689
 this because it happens because if I 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.360
 I suddenly make some mistake here and this 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.390
 I lose I have the copy that made me do 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.110
 the mobile eyecare so that I do not lose 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.860
 what I recorded and it came out good 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.990
 then once I have this 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.620
 and before I forget having 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.810
 selected 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.269
 recording the narration that I did come to 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.299
 narration tools volume 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.360
 story and I upload it to the maximum for not 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.670
 have problems later with the audio 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.860
 I will not do the parts of the edition 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.800
 of the video to put a beginning and a 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.000
 final because we 've already seen it 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.170
 we will do next is whether 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.030
 someone would like to that narration 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.390
 add a musical background 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.580
 we come here 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.260
 principal 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.580
 as we had previously seen 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.580
 add music 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.920
 I do not know, I choose any 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.710
 ready 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.750
 surpass that be that it becomes serious for 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.390
 that they see how to do it adds music I choose 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.750
 the music I give in opening the music is 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.660
 here adds the sound of music and 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.940
 what orange is the sound of narration 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.330
 then when adding music as 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.080
 we had already seen in other items 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.520
 I see that music is in this case 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.680
 good cut we have already seen how to make 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.740
 for 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.569
 I put the editor here 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.479
 make extensions 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.460
 let's say join music if I missed the 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.050
 video then I come to add music in 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.050
 this case as I put the editor there at 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.360
 final I put you add music in the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.819
 current point 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.990
 I choose the same subject again and the 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.020
 music is going to add it to me where I 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.210
 to complete the video then to this 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.650
 second part of the music 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.110
 I will put them 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.940
 in this case to rehearse I have it 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.419
 selected I'm going to tools 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.419
 music 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.430
 fade in and I'm going to get 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.080
 in the middle to see how it comes out infused 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.520
 I'm going to slow you down so 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.039
 finish well 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.039
 and in the music above the selection 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.330
 I'm going to put half of the input 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.820
 also and an infundium of output I'm going to 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.800
 put half to see how it joins with the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.870
 music that I missed 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.000
 then I am ready to listen 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.849
 If it worked out well, let's change the 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.409
 volume music tools the 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.120
 volume of the music I'm going to download it 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.800
 so that it is not so strong with me 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.659
 narration 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.979
 first I have to do it with this 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.039
 I have up and then I have to go 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.659
 down because how are different clues 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.479
 I have to always change the volume to 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.400
 each one selected this music from here 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.729
 in music tools I come here from 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.439
 new and it went down the same 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.360
 then I will not have music so 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:30.909
 strong that I cover my voice in the narration 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.920
 then once done that pretty much 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:36.710

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.560

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.470
 moment 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.380
