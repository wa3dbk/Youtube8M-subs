00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
juggling unit as you can see here these

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.920 
juggling unit as you can see here these
swords<00:02:20.110> are<00:02:20.230> gone<00:02:20.470> into<00:02:20.770> testudo

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
swords are gone into testudo

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.990 
swords are gone into testudo
causing<00:02:22.930> my<00:02:23.050> range<00:02:23.320> attacks<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.190> almost<00:02:24.490> no

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
causing my range attacks to do almost no

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:38.130 
causing my range attacks to do almost no
damage

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.830 

to<00:02:39.140> counter<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.650> simply<00:02:40.430> made<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:41.150> unit<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
to counter this simply made one unit to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.040 
to counter this simply made one unit to
the<00:02:41.959> flame

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.710 

as<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.800> can<00:02:48.980> see<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.880> damage<00:02:50.240> in<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.450> flank

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
as you can see the damage in the flank

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
as you can see the damage in the flank
is<00:02:51.050> considerably<00:02:51.890> higher

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.850 

now<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.689> know<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.049> taking<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.739> the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
now that you know that taking on the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.860 
now that you know that taking on the
sides<00:03:00.129> is<00:03:00.459> more<00:03:00.670> damage<00:03:01.120> than<00:03:01.360> attacking<00:03:01.659> in

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
sides is more damage than attacking in

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.619 
sides is more damage than attacking in
the<00:03:01.989> front<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:03.459> can<00:03:03.489> use<00:03:03.819> this<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.420> do<00:03:04.599> a

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
the front you can use this to do a

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.420 
the front you can use this to do a
pincer<00:03:05.049> maneuver<00:03:05.260> on<00:03:06.040> units<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:07.000> swords<00:03:07.450> as

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
pincer maneuver on units like swords as

pincer maneuver on units like swords as
you<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.579> see<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.090> I'll<00:03:10.329> separate<00:03:10.810> my<00:03:10.989> two

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
you can see here I'll separate my two

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.589 
you can see here I'll separate my two
units<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.799> both<00:03:12.250> sides<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.939> sword<00:03:13.180> unit

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
units on both sides of the sword unit

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.830 
units on both sides of the sword unit
now<00:03:14.379> no<00:03:14.890> matter<00:03:15.099> who<00:03:15.310> he<00:03:15.340> chases<00:03:15.909> he'll<00:03:16.629> be<00:03:16.810> a
