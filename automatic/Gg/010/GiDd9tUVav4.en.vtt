00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
debacle it's like at the beginning of a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
debacle it's like at the beginning of a
recording<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:56.239> didn't<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.390> didn't<00:00:57.899> I

didn't mention no I have a headset okay

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
didn't mention no I have a headset okay
why<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.350> trying<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.100> focus<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.760> all

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
why not trying to get this focus for all

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.359 
why not trying to get this focus for all
you<00:01:12.119> big<00:01:12.360> girls<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:14.189> difficult

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you big girls it's a bit difficult

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.070 
you big girls it's a bit difficult
because<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.150> DS<00:01:15.360> Lite<00:01:15.659> which<00:01:15.869> has

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
because it's on my DS Lite which has

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
because it's on my DS Lite which has
probably<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> nastiest<00:01:17.280> quality<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.820> old

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
probably the nastiest quality in old

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.960 
probably the nastiest quality in old
history<00:01:18.450> oh<00:01:19.460> my<00:01:20.460> god<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> looks<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.030> bad<00:01:22.970> what

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
history oh my god it looks so bad what

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.899 
history oh my god it looks so bad what
does<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> look<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.509> bad<00:01:24.750> oh<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.340> okay

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
does it look so bad oh there we go okay

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.500 
does it look so bad oh there we go okay
who<00:01:29.909> wants<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.780> looks<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.140> don't

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.210 

alright<00:01:35.440> I<00:01:35.470> guess<00:01:35.680> that's<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.920> best<00:01:36.130> it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
alright I guess that's the best it's

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.340 
alright I guess that's the best it's
gonna<00:01:36.370> get<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.850> can't<00:01:37.510> do<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.840> any<00:01:38.140> better

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
gonna get it I can't do it any better

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.460 
gonna get it I can't do it any better
than<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.980> looks<00:01:39.040> horrendous<00:01:40.470> that's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
than that it looks horrendous that's

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.080 
than that it looks horrendous that's
probably<00:01:41.680> why<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:41.980> des<00:01:42.340> doesn't<00:01:42.640> get<00:01:42.760> shines

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
probably why this des doesn't get shines

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.540 
probably why this des doesn't get shines
at<00:01:43.330> all<00:01:43.480> because<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:44.170> horrendous<00:01:44.890> quality

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
at all because it's horrendous quality

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.050 
at all because it's horrendous quality
