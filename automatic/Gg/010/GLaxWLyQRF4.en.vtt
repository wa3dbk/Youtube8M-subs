you<00:02:18.990> can<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.490> figure<00:02:20.490> 8<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.780> one

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
you can get figure 8 and with this one

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.100 
you can get figure 8 and with this one
when<00:02:22.410> enemy<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.040> burning<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.420> deal

your toughness so with this one although
I<00:02:38.310> don't<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.880> much<00:02:39.090> precision<00:02:39.810> because

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
I don't have that much precision because

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.870 
I don't have that much precision because
I<00:02:40.650> am<00:02:40.770> getting<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.160> equipment<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this i will gain an extra force dead

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.150 
this i will gain an extra force dead
which<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.370> precision<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.920> one
