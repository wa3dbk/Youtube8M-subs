00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.439
 More than 50 percent of the toys sold in the state of MichoacÃ¡n 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.899
 they are of Chinese origin I think almost half 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.249
 I think it's that size 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.339
 and this and what I can tell you that according to 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.449
 data that has been handled nationally 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.909
 practically informal trade 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.470
 already in the middle 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 of what dental trade is, however, Michoacan families 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.510
 argues that due to the precarious economic situation they do not have 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.760
 more than looking for low prices 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.870
 of the truth a lot of variety of 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.940
 the ticket was sealed good Sunday evenings to very poor quality of speck 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.930
 of crow markets other 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 our state I do not remember 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700
 the fear the economy 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.290
 economy buzek 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 this Tuesday to Sunday was very important 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.870
 totally agree mexican toy merchants in morelia 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.880
 they complain because the entrance of the Chinese lower their sales they take away 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.410
 the doubts cheaper 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.980
 but it's all 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.630
 the moment of detention 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.990
 impression inspires me a lot 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 if you do not deserve it for example 98 at 5 50 cents 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.340
 but if not, then you know why it is again what it was and announced 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.609
 that does not have 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.000
 the cheap copy cnn 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 1 per hour 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.170
 pure material 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.060
 sader 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.939
 faced with this situation, the Chamber of Commerce that brings together more than 20 thousand 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.390
 companies in the entity calls on the police forces not to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.430
 turn a blind eye and attack this scourge 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.340
 I do not understand the issste 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 as a situation where they filled streets with fayuca toys 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.550
 listen nobody sees them 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.740
 and it turns out that the attorney general's office 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.240
 of state does not see them 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.549
 and it turns out that the different policemen do not see them 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.520
 then that too 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.570
 and this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.680
 is doing input 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.459
 esther many things many times 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609
 more serious of illegality 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 This situation also affects the economy of established commerce 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.560
 generates health problems that can even cause death between 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.559
 little ones that do not get 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.749
 because in an effort to ambush to lower prices 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:29.539
 have lied to situations of contaminated products 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.769
 that have even been toxic to the health of children unfortunately 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.590
 very serious where children who have come to die live 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.740
 Chinese products generate a significant economic loss 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.520
 for the country since they enter without paying tariffs with information of sandra 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.550
