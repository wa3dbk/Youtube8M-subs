00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
now in this segment I did want to take a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.589 
now in this segment I did want to take a
look<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.919> painting<00:00:08.490> mediums<00:00:08.880> now<00:00:09.120> there's<00:00:09.389> all

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
look at painting mediums now there's all

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.900 
look at painting mediums now there's all
sorts<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.260> different<00:00:10.320> painting<00:00:10.889> mediums<00:00:11.370> that

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
sorts of different painting mediums that

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.999 
sorts of different painting mediums that
can<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.269> used<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.809> there<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> wanted

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
can be used out there but what I wanted

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
can be used out there but what I wanted
to<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.549> sort<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.030> show<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> general

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
to do was sort of show a general

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.170 
to do was sort of show a general
overview<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.770> some<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> more<00:00:17.430> common<00:00:17.970> ones

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
overview of some of the more common ones

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.750 
overview of some of the more common ones
that<00:00:18.300> are<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.920> now<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.490> wanted<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that are out there now first I wanted to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.929 
that are out there now first I wanted to
go<00:00:20.939> over<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.980> why<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.039> need<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> painting

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
go over what why you need a painting

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.170 
go over what why you need a painting
medium<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:25.680> exactly<00:00:26.310> goes<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
medium and what exactly goes into a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
medium and what exactly goes into a
painting<00:00:27.599> medium<00:00:27.750> why<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.830> need<00:00:28.949> one

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
painting medium why you really need one

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
painting medium why you really need one
is<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.910> when<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> first<00:00:30.420> squeeze<00:00:30.720> oil<00:00:31.019> paint

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
is that when you first squeeze oil paint

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.370 
is that when you first squeeze oil paint
out<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> tube<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.759> very<00:00:33.719> viscous

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
out of the tube it is very viscous

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 
out of the tube it is very viscous
meaning<00:00:35.010> there's<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> only<00:00:36.030> binder<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.719> there

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
meaning there's the only binder in there

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.569 
meaning there's the only binder in there
at<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.079> point<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.680> oil<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.309> very

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
at that point is in oil and it's very

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.670 
at that point is in oil and it's very
hard<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> maneuver<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> typically<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.559> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
hard to maneuver and typically what you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.619 
hard to maneuver and typically what you
want<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.160> add<00:00:41.489> something<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
want to do is add something to that to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.410 
want to do is add something to that to
make<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> much<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.410> maneuverable<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.670> also

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
make it much more maneuverable and also

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
make it much more maneuverable and also
there's<00:00:45.629> other<00:00:45.809> additives<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> things<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
there's other additives and things you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
there's other additives and things you
can<00:00:47.160> add<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.120> might<00:00:48.539> support<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
can add as well that might support you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260 
can add as well that might support you
in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> particular<00:00:49.800> artistic<00:00:50.550> expression<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in a particular artistic expression that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.470 
in a particular artistic expression that
you're<00:00:51.420> looking<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.610> secondly<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.940> far

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you're looking for and secondly as far

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.500 
you're looking for and secondly as far
as<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.500> far<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> painting<00:00:57.059> medium

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
as the as far as the painting medium

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.080 
as the as far as the painting medium
goes<00:00:58.309> there<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> couple<00:00:59.699> different

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
goes there are a couple different

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
goes there are a couple different
components<00:01:00.289> typically<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> thinner

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
components typically to it a thinner

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.750 
components typically to it a thinner
which<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.650> solvent<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
which is really the the solvent which is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.800 
which is really the the solvent which is
the<00:01:05.970> turpentine<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:07.290> mineral<00:01:07.350> spirits<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the turpentine or mineral spirits and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
the turpentine or mineral spirits and
the<00:01:09.810> binder<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> oils<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> could<00:01:11.670> be

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the binder which is the oils it could be

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
the binder which is the oils it could be
linseed<00:01:12.119> oil<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.540> could<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.869> popular<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.680> could

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
linseed oil it could be popular it could

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.070 
linseed oil it could be popular it could
be<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.460> number<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> different<00:01:15.420> oils<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.080> also

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
be a number of different oils and also

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.679 
be a number of different oils and also
to<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> lesser<00:01:19.350> degree<00:01:20.000> additives<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.270> we're

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
to a lesser degree additives and we're

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
to a lesser degree additives and we're
going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.140> over<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
going to be going over that in just a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.789 
going to be going over that in just a
moment<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.420> first<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> could<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
moment but first one it could kind of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.130 
moment but first one it could kind of
show<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> couple<00:01:26.340> common<00:01:26.820> ones<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.930> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
show you a couple common ones now this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
show you a couple common ones now this
is<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> basically<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.729> common<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is about is basically this common as you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.160 
is about is basically this common as you
can<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.619> linseed<00:01:32.159> oil<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
can get it's really linseed oil and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
can get it's really linseed oil and
turpentine<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
turpentine and this is actually one that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.140 
turpentine and this is actually one that
was<00:01:36.210> used<00:01:36.329> by<00:01:36.540> Monet<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.380> used<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.310> hopper<00:01:38.850> so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
was used by Monet and used by hopper so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.679 
was used by Monet and used by hopper so
really<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.740> basic<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.909> now

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
really about as basic as you can get now

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.789 
really about as basic as you can get now
if<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.350> did<00:01:43.770> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:45.020> substitute<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
if you did want to substitute the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.910 
if you did want to substitute the
linseed<00:01:47.250> oil<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.759> slower<00:01:48.240> drying<00:01:48.540> oil<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
linseed oil for slower drying oil so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.490 
linseed oil for slower drying oil so
it'd<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.579> even<00:01:50.670> slower<00:01:51.119> drawing<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.200> could<00:01:52.350> go

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it'd be even slower drawing you could go

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
it'd be even slower drawing you could go
with<00:01:52.649> something<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.100> poppy<00:01:53.490> oil<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
with something like a poppy oil or like

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200 
with something like a poppy oil or like
a<00:01:54.630> safflower<00:01:55.229> oil<00:01:55.640> certainly<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.090> do

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
a safflower oil certainly you can do

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
a safflower oil certainly you can do
that<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.509> well<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> these<00:01:58.380> also<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that as well and these also have the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.819 
that as well and these also have the
advantage<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> they<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> tendency<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
advantage that they have a tendency to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.280 
advantage that they have a tendency to
yellow<00:02:02.340> much<00:02:02.670> less<00:02:02.939> than<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> linseed<00:02:03.600> oil<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
yellow much less than a linseed oil and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.249 
yellow much less than a linseed oil and
they're<00:02:04.770> also<00:02:04.979> very<00:02:05.399> good<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:06.090> light<00:02:06.840> value

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
they're also very good for light value

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
they're also very good for light value
paintings<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:07.890> example<00:02:08.280> paintings<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
paintings for example paintings with a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.220 
paintings for example paintings with a
lot<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.300> white<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.170> them

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
lot of white in them

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.360 
lot of white in them
now<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:13.400> if<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.269> turpentine<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.709> too<00:02:16.040> strong

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
now if if the turpentine is too strong

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.830 
now if if the turpentine is too strong
of<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.700> solvent<00:02:17.120> for<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.390> could<00:02:17.599> certainly

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
of a solvent for you could certainly

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.009 
of a solvent for you could certainly
substitute<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:19.040> gamsol<00:02:19.909> so<00:02:20.599> that's

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
substitute that for a gamsol so that's

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.399 
substitute that for a gamsol so that's
certainly<00:02:21.290> an<00:02:21.470> option<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:21.950> well<00:02:22.159> now<00:02:23.200> one<00:02:24.200> note

certainly an option as well now one note

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.949 
certainly an option as well now one note
about<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.209> particular<00:02:26.209> medium<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.629> I<00:02:26.690> just

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
about that particular medium that I just

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.720 
about that particular medium that I just
talked<00:02:27.170> about<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.470> have<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:27.769> very<00:02:28.129> careful

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
talked about you have to be very careful

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.970 
talked about you have to be very careful
not<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.540> use<00:02:29.720> too<00:02:29.750> much<00:02:30.080> thinner<00:02:30.410> because<00:02:30.620> that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
not to use too much thinner because that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.470 
not to use too much thinner because that
really<00:02:31.190> breaks<00:02:31.400> down<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.879> adhesive

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
really breaks down the adhesive

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.809 
really breaks down the adhesive
qualities<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.200> paint<00:02:33.440> or<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:34.489> the

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
qualities of the paint or on the

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.280 
qualities of the paint or on the
flipside<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.269> that<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.720> also<00:02:35.780> don't<00:02:36.049> want<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
flipside of that you also don't want to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.869 
flipside of that you also don't want to
use<00:02:36.349> too<00:02:36.590> much<00:02:36.620> oil<00:02:36.950> because<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.640> wrinkle

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
use too much oil because you can wrinkle

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.930 
use too much oil because you can wrinkle
the<00:02:38.060> paint<00:02:38.299> we<00:02:39.290> wrinkle<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.040> paint<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.879> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the paint we wrinkle the paint so it's a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.420 
the paint we wrinkle the paint so it's a
good<00:02:41.060> idea<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.360> kind<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.720> stay<00:02:42.019> somewhere<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:43.280> a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
good idea to kind of stay somewhere in a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.520 
good idea to kind of stay somewhere in a
mid<00:02:43.670> range<00:02:43.879> for<00:02:44.269> those<00:02:44.720> particular<00:02:45.019> mediums

any art supply shop you really which
want<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.890> dissolve<00:03:10.250> those<00:03:10.459> crystals<00:03:10.940> in

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
want to do is dissolve those crystals in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.039 
want to do is dissolve those crystals in
100%<00:03:11.780> gum<00:03:12.410> turpentine<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:14.450> addition<00:03:15.019> of

100% gum turpentine and the addition of

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.780 
100% gum turpentine and the addition of
the<00:03:15.549> damar<00:03:16.549> really<00:03:18.340> has<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> couple<00:03:19.700> of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
the damar really has a couple of

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.080 
the damar really has a couple of
vintages<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.200> well<00:03:21.849> one<00:03:22.849> it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
vintages one is that it's well one it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
vintages one is that it's well one it
causes<00:03:23.540> more<00:03:23.709> glossiness<00:03:24.709> which<00:03:24.889> some<00:03:25.099> people

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
causes more glossiness which some people

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.000 
causes more glossiness which some people
like<00:03:25.519> in<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:26.630> technical<00:03:26.989> advantage<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.739> also

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
like in for technical advantage it also

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.150 
like in for technical advantage it also
protects<00:03:28.849> against<00:03:29.239> dampness<00:03:29.599> so<00:03:30.049> it's<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.130> I

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
protects against dampness so it's one I

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.069 
protects against dampness so it's one I
really<00:03:31.400> prefer<00:03:31.849> it's<00:03:32.120> very<00:03:32.419> common<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:32.930> there

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
really prefer it's very common out there

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.470 
really prefer it's very common out there
a<00:03:33.109> lot<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.380> manufacturers<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.099> their<00:03:34.130> own

Utrecht has one out here oil painting
medium<00:03:37.069> that<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.549> basically<00:03:38.030> those<00:03:38.299> same

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
medium that is basically those same

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.610 
medium that is basically those same
ingredients<00:03:39.400> now<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.359> wanted<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.139> for

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
ingredients now if you wanted to for

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.699 
ingredients now if you wanted to for
example<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:43.099> a<00:03:43.310> smooth<00:03:44.030> very<00:03:44.810> enamel<00:03:45.560> like

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
example have a smooth very enamel like

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.349 
example have a smooth very enamel like
surface<00:03:46.130> you<00:03:46.340> might<00:03:46.489> want<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.790> look<00:03:46.940> into<00:03:47.150> an

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
surface you might want to look into an

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.420 
surface you might want to look into an
oil<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.810> stand<00:03:48.139> oil<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.859> can<00:03:49.069> see<00:03:49.250> right

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
oil like stand oil you can see right

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.360 
oil like stand oil you can see right
here<00:03:49.459> it's<00:03:49.730> very<00:03:49.910> syrupy<00:03:50.349> very<00:03:51.349> viscous<00:03:51.769> slow

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
here it's very syrupy very viscous slow

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.150 
here it's very syrupy very viscous slow
moving<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.209> this<00:03:53.870> would<00:03:54.049> be<00:03:54.169> substituted<00:03:54.590> for

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
moving and this would be substituted for

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.250 
moving and this would be substituted for
one<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.669> the<00:03:55.760> oils<00:03:56.150> like<00:03:56.389> one<00:03:56.569> seed<00:03:56.780> oil<00:03:56.989> or

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
one of the oils like one seed oil or

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.059 
one of the oils like one seed oil or
poppy<00:03:58.099> oil<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:59.780> would<00:04:00.079> give<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.620> nice

overview of what mediums are and some of

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.279 
overview of what mediums are and some of
the<00:05:24.919> possibilities<00:05:25.639> they<00:05:25.789> can<00:05:26.000> use<00:05:26.270> again<00:05:27.050> it

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
the possibilities they can use again it

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.990 
the possibilities they can use again it
depends<00:05:27.620> on<00:05:27.770> what<00:05:27.979> you're<00:05:28.160> looking<00:05:28.460> for<00:05:28.729> as

depends on what you're looking for as

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.029 
depends on what you're looking for as
far<00:05:29.270> as<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.510> expression<00:05:30.410> you're<00:05:30.530> looking<00:05:30.830> for

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
far as the expression you're looking for

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.860 
far as the expression you're looking for
and<00:05:31.600> like<00:05:32.600> choosing<00:05:33.320> your<00:05:33.830> your<00:05:34.430> paint<00:05:35.000> it's

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
and like choosing your your paint it's

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.140 
and like choosing your your paint it's
it<00:05:36.800> really<00:05:37.220> takes<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.520> little<00:05:37.639> bit<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:37.880> healthy

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
it really takes a little bit of healthy

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.210 
it really takes a little bit of healthy
experimentation<00:05:39.080> but<00:05:39.289> at<00:05:39.500> least<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:39.919> gives

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
experimentation but at least this gives

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.790 
experimentation but at least this gives
you<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.729> sort<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.120> framework<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.960> begin<00:05:42.320> with<00:05:42.530> so

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
you a sort of framework to begin with so

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.469 
you a sort of framework to begin with so
next<00:05:43.340> up<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.700> did<00:05:43.880> want<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.120> talk<00:05:44.300> about

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
next up I did want to talk about

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.070 
next up I did want to talk about
solvents<00:05:45.139> so<00:05:45.260> let's<00:05:45.590> take<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.770> look<00:05:45.979> at
