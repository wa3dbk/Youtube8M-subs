a<00:03:30.720> ringer<00:03:31.049> style<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:31.709> obviously<00:03:32.099> it's<00:03:32.519> like<00:03:32.549> a

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
a ringer style and obviously it's like a

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.869 
a ringer style and obviously it's like a
big<00:03:32.760> ring<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.419> different<00:03:34.220> papers<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.609> stuff

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879

big ring of different papers and stuff
like<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:38.030> using<00:03:39.030> actually<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.599> same

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
like that and using actually the same

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.500 
like that and using actually the same
types<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.349> strips<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.829> paper<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.430> can

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
types of strips of paper you can

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.430 
types of strips of paper you can
transform<00:03:42.510> into<00:03:42.750> something<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.200> call<00:03:43.319> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
transform into something and call the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.300 
transform into something and call the
tangle<00:03:43.829> ball

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
tangle ball

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.710 
tangle ball
this<00:03:44.609> kinda<00:03:44.879> looks<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.120> something<00:03:45.449> maybe<00:03:45.599> a

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
this kinda looks like something maybe a

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.809 
this kinda looks like something maybe a
cat<00:03:46.019> would<00:03:46.260> play<00:03:46.440> with<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:47.699> make

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
cat would play with but you can make

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.640 
cat would play with but you can make

both of those and the garland are really
easy<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.109> do<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.470> there's<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.709> couple<00:03:52.949> of<00:03:53.250> other

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
easy to do but there's a couple of other

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.300 
easy to do but there's a couple of other
ideas<00:03:54.840> they're<00:03:55.049> just<00:03:55.290> they're<00:03:55.709> all<00:03:55.859> easy<00:03:56.129> to

ideas they're just they're all easy to

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.710 
ideas they're just they're all easy to
make<00:03:56.459> these<00:03:56.730> are<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.060> slightly<00:03:57.329> more

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
make these are just slightly more

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
make these are just slightly more
advanced<00:03:58.260> okay<00:03:58.829> let<00:03:59.010> me<00:03:59.099> show<00:03:59.129> you<00:03:59.310> another
