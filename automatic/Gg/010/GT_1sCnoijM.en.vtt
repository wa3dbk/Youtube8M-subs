 and there we are and we are supposed to now 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 must open a new profile comfort and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 if here is we are going to click and we 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.690
 will automatically unlock but it will 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.600
 worry this is very normal and it's going to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.530
 pass each time you log in each time 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.140
 let's install fort 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.250
 we start and write our mail or 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.869
 user and our password once 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.940
 I put it, let's click on 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:40.100
 play to check that if it was installed 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.490
 correctly we will have to wait 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.490
 let's see now 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.429
 there it is and it appeared very well that that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.600
 give a good signal and we see here 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.969
 changes for example after this 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.039
 We have three active modes and one option 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.799
 new call mods we are going to click and 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.420
 we see that we have three downloaded mods 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.950
 even though we have not downloaded anything 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 this is motive come by default 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270
 comfort and will allow us to add other 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.459
 we are going to close it, there are no changes 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.109
 since we are not going to need it anymore and 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.060
 now although the good lobe we're going to 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.849
 settle in this case I decided 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 download the mod de montgrÃ­ kers for 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.069
 download we are going to click here on 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.319
 member will send us again to another 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.620
 add fly page and we will have to 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.120
 wait for 5 seconds 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.739
 once I wait for five seconds 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.480
 let's click on jump advertising and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.430
 again we will have to wait for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.860
 is 7 seconds on this page to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.230
 that we generate the download link 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.000
 let's click on generate link and now 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.530
 yes we can download our mode in 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.150
 this case I 'm not going to do it because I 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.209
 I have not downloaded 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.159
 and now we are going to search and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.590
 let's write this percent app 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.120
 data percent and it's going to look like a 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.129
 option called roaming we are going to give 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.900
 click we are going to click on the folder of 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.579
 point minecraft we are going to click on the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.980
 mods folder and now the only thing that 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.049
 going to do is drag the way to 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.180
 the folder in case it does not come out 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.349
 that in states and possesses as 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.109
 Booklets mean that they do not have 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.340
 downloaded the winrar I'm also going to 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.739
 leave some links so that what 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.299
 download in the description very well 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.879
 now it is the one that is supposed to be our 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.930
 mode is installed let's click 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:22.859
 in minecraft to open it and check it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:25.379
 it is assumed that the mount is already installed 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.819
 very well we do not see it as comfort and we 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.280
 says that we are ready to play the 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:35.359
 1.7 points 2 comfort now let's wait 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.359
 that opens correctly 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.069
 Y 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.760
 we're going to treat him a little bit there we are already 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.400
 and we can see the changes for example 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.760
 that we now have four assets and here 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.580
 we have the mobile tours downloaded we go 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.400
 to generate a new world on the server 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.740
 to be able to explore it to see if we are 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.810
 have correctly installed the world and 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.660
 we can observe all the new 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.550
 creatures that the world contains us 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.550
 let's see creating terrain 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 this may take a little 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.910
 there we are, let's see 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.830
 okay 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.540
 I think this is a generation loop 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.730
 something strong 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.980
 and it's loading a piece of land 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.260
 go Go 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.610
 the land is loaded and even the most 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.470
 we are seeing the normal animals of 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.050
 minecraft we are not seeing any 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.060
 let's see if we can find 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.060
 alcohol or some creature 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:59.689
 wow we can already see some some of 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.089
 the mods that includes how to 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.619
 example this bow tie and well then I think 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.869
 that our mode is confirmed 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.939
 is correctly installed very well 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:10.009
 I think that for my part it would be everything 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.559
 forget to click on subscribe if it is 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.659
 that they liked and like it 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:18.729
 all that helps a lot and for my part 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.729
 it would be all thanks until then
