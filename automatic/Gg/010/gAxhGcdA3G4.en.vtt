00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.759
Today I’m going to give you a quick overview of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.839
the newest CNC from Inventables. 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.370
Meet the X-Carve the newest CNC from Inventables.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.160
It’s got 50% less parts than their previous machine

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.520
which means it takes 50% less time to assemble.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.230
One power supply to power everything, 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.220
and a new spindle mount for more rigidity and accuracy.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380
This machine is  open source and completely customizable.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.260
Today I’m going to show you a technique to make this sign and keeping all the small pieces properly spaced. 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Take a look.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.700
I first start by clamping down my wood to the wasteboard. 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.000
There are many ways to do this but I prefer double sided tape.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840
Then I lower the bit until it just kisses the wood.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.100
In Adobe Illustrator I’ll draw my art.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.860
If you use text you’ll need to convert it to outlines.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.920
I will then reverse it and save it as an SVG.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.350
I’ll then navigate to Easel.com, log in and import my SVG into a new project.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.900
I’m going to slightly modify my art so you can see how easy it is.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.740
Next I’ll go in and modify my material to the species and size I’m using.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.770
Which happens to be walnut that is 11” x 7” by 1/4 thick.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.280
Then you’ll have to choose if you want to cut a fill, on the line, inside our out and we want to cut outside the line.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.180
I’ll then set the depth of my cut to just a hair shy of the full thickness.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.900
Next I’ll click Carve, confirm the thickness and then make sure the material is secure, 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.370
select the size bit I’m using, confirm the bit is in the home position, 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.510
tell the machine to raise the bit, turn the spindle on and start carving.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.020
From here it’s just a waiting game as the X-Carve will cut out my art with a few passes.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.130
Now we’ll add CA glue to the parts we want to keep.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.120
Spray some activator on the mating board, position the art and add some weight to clamp it down for a minute.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.080
Now it’s just a matter of sanding through until the art is revealed.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.300
This technique can be used with any CNC projects that involve small pieces where alignment is key. 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.980

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.220
If you’re new to my channel I put out new videos every week 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.620
and you can find out more about me on my website at DrunkenWoodworker.com.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.780
Thanks for watching. Be safe. Stay passionate and 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.940
make something!
