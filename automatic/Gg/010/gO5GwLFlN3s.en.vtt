transcription demo and over on the right
and<00:03:09.099> notice<00:03:10.099> also<00:03:11.049> not<00:03:12.049> only<00:03:12.170> did<00:03:12.440> it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
and notice also not only did it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.550 
and notice also not only did it
faithfully<00:03:13.099> convert<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.730> printing<00:03:14.599> to<00:03:15.109> text

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
faithfully convert the printing to text

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.490 
faithfully convert the printing to text
but<00:03:16.129> it<00:03:16.250> did<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> reasonably<00:03:17.389> nice<00:03:17.540> job<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
but it did a reasonably nice job on the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.180 
but it did a reasonably nice job on the
table<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.870> then<00:03:20.870> down<00:03:21.200> below<00:03:21.230> here<00:03:21.769> remember

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
table and then down below here remember

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.830 
table and then down below here remember
how<00:03:22.639> I<00:03:22.670> had<00:03:23.000> written<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.450> cursive<00:03:23.989> over<00:03:24.500> here

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
how I had written in cursive over here

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.110 
how I had written in cursive over here
well<00:03:27.250> seems<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.519> did<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.670> pretty<00:03:28.909> good<00:03:29.060> job

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
well seems like it did a pretty good job

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.809 
well seems like it did a pretty good job
transcribing<00:03:30.049> my<00:03:30.769> cursive<00:03:31.220> handwriting<00:03:31.519> as

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819

well<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.269> then<00:03:32.989> what<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.620> learned<00:03:34.159> I<00:03:34.579> share

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
well and then what I learned I share

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.500 
well and then what I learned I share
this<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:36.879> basically<00:03:37.879> what<00:03:38.090> I've<00:03:38.209> learned

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
this here basically what I've learned

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.569 
this here basically what I've learned
learned<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.620> if<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.250> average<00:03:40.430> person

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
learned is that if the average person

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.750 
learned is that if the average person
can<00:03:41.000> read<00:03:41.329> you're<00:03:41.569> printing<00:03:41.959> or<00:03:42.260> cursive<00:03:42.760> then

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
can read you're printing or cursive then

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.580 
can read you're printing or cursive then
