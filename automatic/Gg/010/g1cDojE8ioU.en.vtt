as<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.740> showed<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> last<00:00:23.910> video<00:00:25.669> one<00:00:26.669> is<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
as I showed in the last video one is to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.749 
as I showed in the last video one is to
give<00:00:28.020> it<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.259> more<00:00:28.610> rounded<00:00:29.610> ball<00:00:30.329> appearance

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
give it a more rounded ball appearance

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.319 
give it a more rounded ball appearance
now<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> did<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:34.340> with<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.579> cut<00:00:36.090> an

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
now all I did there with was cut an

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
now all I did there with was cut an
extra<00:00:36.840> notch<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.440> an<00:00:37.860> extra<00:00:39.380> angle<00:00:40.520> on<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
extra notch or an extra angle on the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.720 
extra notch or an extra angle on the
backside<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.660> each<00:00:42.930> piece<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.220> goes<00:00:44.460> from

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
backside of each piece so it goes from

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.890 
backside of each piece so it goes from
this<00:00:45.060> to<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:53.700> but<00:00:54.690> those

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
this to this but other than but those

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.240 
this to this but other than but those
outside<00:00:55.410> cuts<00:00:56.660> nothing<00:00:57.660> else<00:00:57.900> has<00:00:58.170> changed

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:09.700 

but<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.610> just<00:01:02.820> portney

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.709 

one<00:01:10.310> cut

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
one cut

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.340 
one cut
not<00:01:12.259> just<00:01:12.439> still<00:01:12.590> fortunate

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:30.080 

there<00:01:17.890> we<00:01:17.950> go

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.140 

or<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.869> can<00:01:32.140> create<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:34.290> star<00:01:35.290> appearance

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
or you can create the star appearance

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.940 
or you can create the star appearance
but<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.270> like<00:01:37.540> that<00:01:37.780> one<00:01:37.990> that's<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.350> cool<00:01:38.560> one

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
but I like that one that's a cool one

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.649 
but I like that one that's a cool one
and<00:01:39.520> all<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.360> did<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:44.500> add<00:01:44.950> two<00:01:45.820> cuts<00:01:46.330> on

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
and all I did there was add two cuts on

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.510 
and all I did there was add two cuts on
each<00:01:47.350> end<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:51.399> ends<00:01:51.729> up<00:01:51.820> like<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:53.520> other

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
each end so it ends up like that other

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.510 
each end so it ends up like that other
than<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:55.530> everything<00:01:56.530> stayed<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.190> exact

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
than that everything stayed the exact

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.639 
than that everything stayed the exact
same<00:01:58.500> we're<00:01:59.500> gonna<00:01:59.740> cut<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.790> each<00:02:00.970> piece

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
same we're gonna cut the each piece

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.770 
same we're gonna cut the each piece
there<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:04.380> there<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.710> there<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.270> it'll<00:02:07.539> be

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
there there there and there so it'll be

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:22.490 
there there there and there so it'll be
just<00:02:08.289> like<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:12.610> each<00:02:12.850> end

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:33.760 

is<00:02:22.860> not

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:03:11.490 

not<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.520> down

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.910 

so<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.799> standard<00:03:12.950> piece<00:03:14.709> that's<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
so that's the standard piece that's the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.240 
so that's the standard piece that's the
ball<00:03:16.629> variation<00:03:18.849> but<00:03:19.849> turn<00:03:19.969> it<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.150> way

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
ball variation but turn it that way

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.780 
ball variation but turn it that way
that's<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.430> star<00:03:22.700> variation<00:03:23.329> he<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:25.280> go<00:03:25.459> from

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
that's the star variation he can go from

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.819 
that's the star variation he can go from
our<00:03:26.030> standard<00:03:27.370> block<00:03:28.370> Eber<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:30.500> the
