00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
sky here's something that I did ahead of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.220 
sky here's something that I did ahead of
time<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:04.940> did<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.180> little<00:02:05.270> experimenting

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
time I just did a little experimenting

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.840 
time I just did a little experimenting
with<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.500> colors<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.890> see<00:02:07.220> what<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.400> was<00:02:07.580> going

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
with the colors to see what I was going

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.340 
with the colors to see what I was going
to<00:02:07.880> like<00:02:08.270> best<00:02:08.600> it's<00:02:08.869> totally<00:02:09.200> your

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
to like best it's totally your

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.320 
to like best it's totally your
preference<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.250> want<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.580> experiment<00:02:11.030> a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
preference if you want to experiment a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.460 
preference if you want to experiment a
little<00:02:11.360> bit<00:02:11.570> especially<00:02:11.930> since<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.410> is

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
little bit especially since this is

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.740 
little bit especially since this is
really<00:02:12.620> only<00:02:12.920> my<00:02:13.130> second<00:02:13.520> time<00:02:13.700> doing<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.300> so

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
really only my second time doing this so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.080 
really only my second time doing this so
I<00:02:14.780> decided<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.620> liked<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.490> one<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.880> best

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
I decided that I liked this one the best

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.910 
I decided that I liked this one the best
it's<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.390> little<00:02:17.690> more<00:02:17.840> subdued<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.560> Blues<00:02:18.890> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
it's a little more subdued the Blues a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.430 
it's a little more subdued the Blues a
little<00:02:19.460> more<00:02:20.090> faint<00:02:20.450> if<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.810> guys<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.260> see

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
little more faint if you guys can see

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.220 
little more faint if you guys can see
that<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:21.800> close<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.180> really<00:02:23.570> liked<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.080> way

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
that up close but I really liked the way

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.840 
that up close but I really liked the way
that<00:02:24.440> looked<00:02:24.830> compared<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.430> some<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
that looked compared to some of the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.610 
that looked compared to some of the
other<00:02:26.000> results<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.810> got<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.230> I'm<00:02:27.290> gonna<00:02:27.440> go

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
other results that I got so I'm gonna go

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.070 
other results that I got so I'm gonna go
with<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.010> one<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.640> first<00:02:29.150> started<00:02:29.570> off<00:02:29.780> by

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
with this one I first started off by
