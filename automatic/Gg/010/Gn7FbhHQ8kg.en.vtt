from flat sheet into raised forms using
a<00:00:33.930> loss<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> hammering<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> etching

combining<00:00:36.420> different<00:00:36.570> metals<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.290> work<00:00:37.469> both

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
combining different metals I work both

in<00:00:37.860> precious<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.430> non-precious<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:39.360> don't

in precious and non-precious I don't

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
in precious and non-precious I don't
really<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:41.129> distinction<00:00:41.640> between<00:00:42.270> them

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
really see a distinction between them

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
really see a distinction between them
obviously<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> terms<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> value<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
obviously there is in terms of value but

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.139 
obviously there is in terms of value but
in<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> approach<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.370> likely<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
in how I approach them I'm as likely to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
in how I approach them I'm as likely to
treat<00:00:48.510> silver<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.079> same<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.710> treat

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
treat silver in the same way as I treat

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.069 
treat silver in the same way as I treat
steel<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.910> sort<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> quite<00:00:51.390> roughly<00:00:51.780> perhaps

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
steel so sort of quite roughly perhaps

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.100 
steel so sort of quite roughly perhaps
and<00:00:52.440> etching<00:00:53.010> hammering<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> combine

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and etching hammering I like to combine

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.119 
and etching hammering I like to combine
the<00:00:55.260> different<00:00:55.500> colors<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:57.530> textures<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the different colors and textures to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
the different colors and textures to
produce<00:00:59.340> interesting<00:01:00.030> objects<00:01:00.420> hopefully

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
produce interesting objects hopefully

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.579

i started off and my working life
working<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.400> finance<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.329> although<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.840> knew

working in finance which although I knew
it<00:01:31.200> wasn't<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> wanted<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.280> at<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it wasn't what I wanted to do at that

it wasn't what I wanted to do at that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
time I wasn't really all that sure what

careers<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.009> i<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.460> say<00:01:38.640> probably<00:01:38.820> fell<00:01:39.270> into

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
careers I i would say probably fell into

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260 
careers I i would say probably fell into
how<00:01:39.990> he<00:01:40.049> chosen<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> wrong<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> levels<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
how he chosen the wrong a levels but it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.050 
how he chosen the wrong a levels but it
it<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.840> give<00:01:43.079> me<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.530> chance<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.729> earn<00:01:44.759> some

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it did give me a chance to earn some

money<00:01:45.149> let's<00:01:45.630> pay<00:01:45.840> two<00:01:46.259> years<00:01:46.470> travelling

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
money let's pay two years travelling
which<00:01:47.579> did<00:01:47.850> give<00:01:48.030> me<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> time<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> think

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
which did give me the time to think

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.560 
which did give me the time to think
about<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:49.619> interested<00:01:50.220> me<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> i

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
about what really interested me and i

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.719 
about what really interested me and i
thought<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> child<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.399> always

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
thought back as a child of is always

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.690 
thought back as a child of is always
making<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:56.009> thought<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.549> perhaps

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
making things so I thought well perhaps

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
making things so I thought well perhaps
where<00:01:57.000> did<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> foundation<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.869> art<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.259> design

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
where did a foundation in art and design

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
where did a foundation in art and design
I<00:01:58.770> could<00:01:58.920> narrow<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> find<00:02:00.060> out

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I could narrow it down to find out

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.080 
I could narrow it down to find out
exactly<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> wanted<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> make<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.090> in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
exactly what I wanted to make and in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
exactly what I wanted to make and in
that<00:02:03.570> time<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.350> fell<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.530> love<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:04.950> metal

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that time I just fell in love with metal

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.839 
that time I just fell in love with metal
it<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.329> something<00:02:06.979> once<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.160> picked<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it was something once I picked it up and

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.430 
it was something once I picked it up and
found<00:02:09.060> how<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.629> hammer<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.229> change

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
found how you can hammer it and change

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.280 
found how you can hammer it and change
the<00:02:10.619> way<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> looked<00:02:11.750> well<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.870> found<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the way it looked well I just found it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.680 
the way it looked well I just found it
incredible

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
incredible

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.810 
incredible
citing<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.770> feel<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.340> haven't<00:02:15.580> looked

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
citing and feel like I haven't looked

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.120 
citing and feel like I haven't looked
back<00:02:15.940> since<00:02:18.660> peace<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.840> now<00:02:19.990> we'll<00:02:20.140> cut<00:02:20.380> out<00:02:20.590> so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
back since peace is now we'll cut out so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.670 
back since peace is now we'll cut out so
the<00:02:21.340> next<00:02:21.490> stage<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.030> boil<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.630> just<00:02:23.320> soften

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the next stage is to boil it just soften

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.070 
the next stage is to boil it just soften
the<00:02:23.800> piece<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.280> gets<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.820> cherry<00:02:25.480> red<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the piece so it gets to cherry red and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.930 
the piece so it gets to cherry red and
then<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.560> know<00:02:26.620> from<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.190> color<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.820> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
then I know from the color that it's the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:44.430 
then I know from the color that it's the
right<00:02:27.970> softness<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.960> work<00:02:29.290> on

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.990 

if<00:02:45.440> i<00:02:45.590> heated<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.459> saw<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> color

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
if i heated it then you saw the color

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.839 
if i heated it then you saw the color
change<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> brighter<00:02:48.190> quite<00:02:49.190> ong<00:02:49.670> red

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
change to a brighter quite ong red

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.720 
change to a brighter quite ong red
that's<00:02:50.780> ready<00:02:51.110> I'm<00:02:51.920> now<00:02:52.099> going<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> carry<00:02:52.610> it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
that's ready I'm now going to carry it

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.550 
that's ready I'm now going to carry it
through<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.239> pickle<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.930> quench<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.379> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
through to the pickle to quench it and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.729 
through to the pickle to quench it and
clean<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:59.510> quite<00:02:59.750> clean<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.290> was<00:03:00.500> them

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
clean it it's quite clean that was them

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.650 
clean it it's quite clean that was them
quench<00:03:01.220> while<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.610> was<00:03:01.700> hot<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.269> have<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
quench while it was hot and I have to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:14.319 
quench while it was hot and I have to
just<00:03:02.810> wash<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.200> acid<00:03:03.530> off<00:03:13.060> when<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.150> was<00:03:14.299> a

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
just wash the acid off when I was a

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.170 
just wash the acid off when I was a
child<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:15.129> thought<00:03:16.129> I<00:03:16.250> made<00:03:16.430> things<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.970> play

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
child I thought I made things to play

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.460 
child I thought I made things to play
with<00:03:17.209> them<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:17.660> actually<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.049> think<00:03:18.079> I<00:03:18.410> just

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
with them but actually I think I just

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.800 
with them but actually I think I just
made<00:03:18.799> them<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.280> sake<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.489> making<00:03:19.819> them<00:03:20.209> my

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
made them for the sake of making them my

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.270 
made them for the sake of making them my
favorite<00:03:21.230> thing<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.500> made<00:03:21.709> which<00:03:21.950> probably

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
favorite thing I made which probably

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.830 
favorite thing I made which probably
took<00:03:22.640> me<00:03:22.790> about<00:03:22.940> two<00:03:23.239> years<00:03:23.420> all<00:03:23.660> together

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
took me about two years all together

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.259 
took me about two years all together
because<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.319> kept<00:03:24.530> adding<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.160> was<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.879> shop

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
because I kept adding to it was a shop

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.949 
because I kept adding to it was a shop
and<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:27.470> made<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.069> actual<00:03:28.430> outside<00:03:29.209> part<00:03:29.540> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
and I made the actual outside part and

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.050 
and I made the actual outside part and
then<00:03:30.079> I<00:03:30.140> made<00:03:30.410> all<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.769> little<00:03:31.069> counters<00:03:31.910> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
then I made all the little counters and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.699 
then I made all the little counters and
things<00:03:32.239> inside<00:03:32.629> it<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:32.900> then<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.290> made<00:03:33.440> all<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
things inside it and then I made all the

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.099 
things inside it and then I made all the
food<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.190> sell<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.599> idea<00:03:35.870> was<00:03:35.930> that

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
food to sell in it and the idea was that

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.809 
food to sell in it and the idea was that
I<00:03:36.319> was<00:03:36.470> then<00:03:36.620> play<00:03:36.829> with<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.340> play<00:03:37.519> shops

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
I was then play with it and play shops

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.059 
I was then play with it and play shops
but<00:03:38.060> actually<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.840> really<00:03:39.500> didn't<00:03:39.769> interest

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
but actually that really didn't interest

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.039 
but actually that really didn't interest
me<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.340> much<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.910> was<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.299> was<00:03:41.450> making<00:03:41.900> that

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
me that much it was it was making that

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.800 
me that much it was it was making that
alight<00:03:42.410> I'm<00:03:43.160> now<00:03:43.400> good<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.670> start<00:03:43.910> getting<00:03:44.690> the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
alight I'm now good to start getting the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.870 
alight I'm now good to start getting the
shape<00:03:45.049> by<00:03:45.290> hammering<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.739> onto<00:03:46.129> an<00:03:46.250> old<00:03:46.430> tree

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
shape by hammering it onto an old tree

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.599 
shape by hammering it onto an old tree
stump<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.620> first<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.739> all<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.829> started<00:03:49.370> humming

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
stump and first of all I started humming

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.059 
stump and first of all I started humming
onto<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.180> flat<00:03:50.389> surface<00:03:50.959> but<00:03:51.530> then<00:03:51.709> I'll<00:03:51.859> move

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
onto the flat surface but then I'll move

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.059 
onto the flat surface but then I'll move
it<00:03:52.220> into<00:03:52.430> some<00:03:53.030> indents<00:03:53.450> I've<00:03:53.750> made<00:03:54.069> because

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
it into some indents I've made because

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.460 
it into some indents I've made because
that<00:03:55.340> way<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.489> can<00:03:55.790> determine<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:57.200> shape

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
that way I can determine the the shape

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:12.460 
that way I can determine the the shape
of<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.680> finished<00:03:58.040> piece<00:04:10.930> my<00:04:11.930> degree<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.260> I

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
of the finished piece my degree so I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.610 
of the finished piece my degree so I
made<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.829> selection<00:04:13.549> of<00:04:14.030> metal<00:04:14.750> containers<00:04:15.410> at

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
made a selection of metal containers at

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.110 
made a selection of metal containers at
health<00:04:15.799> pebbles<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.519> they<00:04:16.609> were<00:04:16.669> all<00:04:16.760> pebbles

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
health pebbles and they were all pebbles

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.020 
health pebbles and they were all pebbles
that<00:04:17.269> had<00:04:17.450> picked<00:04:18.169> up<00:04:18.349> at<00:04:18.590> various<00:04:19.099> times<00:04:19.430> that

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
that had picked up at various times that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.770 
that had picked up at various times that
were<00:04:20.479> some<00:04:21.079> significance<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.769> me<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:23.690> I

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
were some significance to me and when I

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.870 
were some significance to me and when I
left<00:04:23.990> college<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.740> was<00:04:25.099> worried<00:04:25.370> about<00:04:25.669> when

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
left college I was worried about when

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.909 
left college I was worried about when
our<00:04:26.000> bid<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.389> sell<00:04:26.599> my<00:04:26.750> work<00:04:26.960> so<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.500> was<00:04:27.680> trying

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
our bid to sell my work so I was trying

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.430 
our bid to sell my work so I was trying
to<00:04:28.070> think<00:04:28.330> how<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.360> could<00:04:29.690> change<00:04:29.930> its<00:04:30.139> making

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
to think how I could change its making

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440 
to think how I could change its making
containers<00:04:31.010> in<00:04:31.160> something<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.880> people

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
containers in something that people

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.029 
containers in something that people
would<00:04:32.570> buy<00:04:32.750> because<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.260> wasn't<00:04:33.500> sure<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.919> I

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
would buy because I wasn't sure that I

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.250 
would buy because I wasn't sure that I
would<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.460> able<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.669> sell<00:04:35.080> containers<00:04:36.080> with

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
would be able to sell containers with

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.200 
would be able to sell containers with
pebbles<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.889> especially<00:04:37.400> pebbles<00:04:37.729> I<00:04:37.880> picked

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
pebbles in especially pebbles I picked

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.469 
pebbles in especially pebbles I picked
up<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.860> really<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.699> sat<00:04:40.880> down<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.300> looks

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
up so I really just sat down and looks

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:42.909 
up so I really just sat down and looks
at<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.750> shape<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.169> them<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:42.530> they've<00:04:42.889> just

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
at the shape of them and they've just

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.150 
at the shape of them and they've just
seemed<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.669> lend<00:04:43.880> themselves<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:45.160> being

evening<00:04:49.580> bags<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.240> then<00:04:51.169> when<00:04:51.469> I<00:04:51.560> got<00:04:51.590> onto

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
evening bags and then when I got onto

evening bags and then when I got onto
the<00:04:52.099> bags

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
the bags

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.640 
the bags
I<00:04:53.090> had<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.360> free<00:04:53.630> rein<00:04:53.930> with<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.290> design<00:04:54.620> of

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
I had a free rein with the design of

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.090 
I had a free rein with the design of
them<00:04:55.040> so<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.550> worked<00:04:56.389> quite<00:04:56.660> well<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.139> that

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
them so that worked quite well so that

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.860 
them so that worked quite well so that
they<00:04:58.280> yes<00:04:58.490> they<00:04:58.520> grew<00:04:58.910> out<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.090> little

the look of the piece you can actually

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.460 
the look of the piece you can actually
hear<00:05:33.200> when<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.889> hammer<00:05:34.070> strikes<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:35.200> I'm<00:05:36.200> time

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
correctly and doing what it should be

00:05:49.610 --> 00:06:01.090 
correctly and doing what it should be
doing<00:05:51.280> it<00:05:52.280> around<00:05:59.470> listening<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:00.800> sound

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
and actually moving the hammer ends up

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.659 
and actually moving the hammer ends up
being<00:06:03.979> almost<00:06:04.640> in<00:06:05.030> an<00:06:05.210> instinctive<00:06:05.960> thing<00:06:06.669> you

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
being almost in an instinctive thing you

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.040 
being almost in an instinctive thing you
can<00:06:07.850> just<00:06:08.030> feel<00:06:08.180> it's<00:06:08.390> right<00:06:08.600> when<00:06:08.930> you're

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
can just feel it's right when you're

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.740 
can just feel it's right when you're
hanging<00:06:09.229> correctly<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:12.789> like<00:06:13.789> the<00:06:14.090> actual<00:06:14.450> feel

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
hanging correctly I like the actual feel

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.710 
hanging correctly I like the actual feel
of<00:06:15.140> having<00:06:15.590> a<00:06:15.800> hammer<00:06:16.010> in<00:06:16.550> my<00:06:16.610> hand<00:06:16.970> I<00:06:17.390> like<00:06:17.570> the

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
of having a hammer in my hand I like the

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.870 
of having a hammer in my hand I like the
sound<00:06:17.900> it<00:06:18.140> makes<00:06:18.289> on<00:06:18.530> the<00:06:18.620> metal<00:06:18.979> I<00:06:19.190> suppose

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
sound it makes on the metal I suppose

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.170 
sound it makes on the metal I suppose
sometimes<00:06:20.740> it's<00:06:21.740> slightly<00:06:22.130> therapeutic<00:06:22.910> you

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
sometimes it's slightly therapeutic you

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.240 
sometimes it's slightly therapeutic you
can<00:06:23.690> perhaps<00:06:24.110> daydream<00:06:24.710> while<00:06:24.800> you<00:06:25.070> do<00:06:25.220> it

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
can perhaps daydream while you do it

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.250 
can perhaps daydream while you do it
it's<00:06:25.880> not<00:06:25.970> that<00:06:26.120> you<00:06:26.210> don't<00:06:26.360> think<00:06:26.750> it's<00:06:26.990> just

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
it's not that you don't think it's just

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.960 
it's not that you don't think it's just
that<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.560> your<00:06:27.919> mind<00:06:28.190> is<00:06:28.340> free<00:06:28.580> to<00:06:28.760> think

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
that you your mind is free to think

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.100 
that you your mind is free to think
about<00:06:29.180> other<00:06:29.360> things<00:06:29.720> while<00:06:29.960> you're

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
about other things while you're

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.590 
about other things while you're
hammering<00:06:30.500> it's<00:06:31.130> just<00:06:31.400> photos<00:06:31.880> I<00:06:32.060> absolutely

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
hammering it's just photos I absolutely

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.360 
hammering it's just photos I absolutely
love<00:06:32.870> doing<00:06:33.139> and<00:06:33.289> as<00:06:33.440> long<00:06:33.620> as<00:06:33.770> I'm<00:06:33.889> not<00:06:33.919> making

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
love doing and as long as I'm not making

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.129 
love doing and as long as I'm not making
the<00:06:34.490> same<00:06:34.520> pieces<00:06:34.940> all<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.300> time<00:06:35.600> as<00:06:35.840> long<00:06:35.990> as

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
the same pieces all the time as long as

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.529 
the same pieces all the time as long as
I'm<00:06:36.979> constantly<00:06:37.520> setting<00:06:37.789> myself<00:06:38.030> a<00:06:38.419> new
