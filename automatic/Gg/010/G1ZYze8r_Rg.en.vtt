00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 these people start making money 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.770
 very early today you have a boy from 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 base category between 40 and 50 thousand 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.849
 reais per month to play my dear, nor 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.410
 so easy because I study I'm seeing 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.160
 all without studying so I will continue 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.759
 like this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.160
 I think it's a little contemptuous of the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.690
 clear majority that there are honorable and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.050
 but the vast majority do not care 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.050
 thereby 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 You're in the trio there was such a person. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.390
 back today getting here in our 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.520
 milton studio the milk of the beast 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 sports broadcasting of journalism 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.270
 I never bothered to do stick 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 to sign up to be thinking a cool thing 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
 it's the first really went well 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.460
 over here because all these expressions 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.710
 I wear 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 they were already of use not only mine but of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.079
 friends my grandchildren in things I have not even been 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 I invented it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.570
 then it is what beauty for example is the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.010
 most famous of them neither is mine is of André 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 that a sports reporter with a 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 who worked there a long time on the radio and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.190
 he who wore what beauty then 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 so ironic as I use today, huh? 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.670
 only one day on a transmission of sound 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280
 Miguel until the 2000 Olympics final 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 I'm still in this in Brazil. 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.010
 it was then incorporated into the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.479
 vocabulary in my play with 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.409
 my friends and I just have one 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.760
 transition 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.320
 and then you will see the repercussion 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.549
 it is noticed that people liked the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.380
 people thought that interesting is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.610
 different then you said it here 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 I think I can repeat it. 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.060
 thus becoming the others were arising 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 I have also never created a staff 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.930
 specifically a broadcast them 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.150
 appeared because they already existed there 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.520
 some way on my friends wheels 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 and relatives anyway, it was all like that. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.460
 man gives impression that he stays on the sofa 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.079
 these kind of people are staying on the couch 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 Waiting for you to make a mistake, the guy is with a 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.189
 Bloch in hand there when you love a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 information or exchange a player's name 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.780
 for the note goes to twitter métropole 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 I liked this kind of thing already 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 bothered even more bother me because 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.200
 You prepare me for more people. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.040
 They work in general prepare 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.450
 too much 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.860
 usually the people who are in that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.689
 means no longer on cable television, which is a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 thing and very much demand because 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.520
 Dude, what are you paying for? 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 people realize that there is a concern 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.119
 everyone study and prepare for the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.280
 game with the number of information and such 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.860
 You talk for two and a half hours, you? 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.080
 hit almost everything that a single misstep 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.550
 The guy goes there and does not tell me 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.900
 it bothers a little but I confess not 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.220
 It bothered me a lot more nowadays. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.650
 I know it has a lot to do with the passion of the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.659
 with the winning team or 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 not right his team the guy loses you the worst 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.930
 player of the world you scream team goal 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.000
 longer 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.340
 if his team won sensational 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.439
 spectacular then in time you will 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.359
 learning to realize this 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.859
 emotional imbalance of the 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.470
 soccer where I lived in jundiaí 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.939
 worked in the newspaper and on the radio there I 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.620
 had many friends who had come 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.269
 For Sao Paulo, they work in newspapers here. 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.439
 especially in the staging of a very 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.420
 big there and I played 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.620
 in one of them gave me the tip one day I already 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.790
 had expressed interest in coming 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.709
 work in sao paulo 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.030
 and then to advance their careers because 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.069
 wages are higher in six 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.690
 opportunities is one of them. 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.940
 call to speak we have a chance here 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.379
 but the economy has nothing more than 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.540
 that the weak economy wants to know I'm going 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.010
 in because I think this was a brand 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.780
 of my career was like that. 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.909
 do not be prejudiced with anything in any 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 subject in publishing when it appeared the 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.260
 chance in the economy that is the possibility 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.819
 to come to São Paulo I decided to get the snake 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.340
 You 'll prepare if it's going to start. 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.379
 to read each of economics to learn 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.930
 So that's what I usually say until 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.419
 When a lot of students look for the end, I'll go. 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.099
 talking to university staff is a 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.980
 little what mine think today 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.510
 I have to the point that I arrived at 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.090
 my career that is a legal point 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.199
 Anyway, if I succeeded in my 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.699
 career has something to do with this 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.690
 training that I had in my own 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.220
 career 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 I mean I'm not a guy I graduated 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.799
 In sports I stayed in sports, you only talk. 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.030
 of sports 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.739
 so I worked with a program of 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.750
 varieties on the radio and newspaper I did 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.430
 many other things on radio did 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.659
 almost everything too 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.190
 there I had the chance to work almost 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.049
 four years in the economy of the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.940
 a time of economy one of the most 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.500
 of journalism that we do not 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.579
 had economic stability that people 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.639
 have today 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.829
 So all this training for me today is 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.299
 important to you so I know what I 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.709
 I'm on my way to protecting the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.750
 development that I have though today 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.799
 fixed only on the sport 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.870
 so I really appreciate the opportunities 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.579
 that I've had all along this 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.810
 career period outside the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.379
 sport even outside the area that I 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.540
 liked 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.030
 we're off the air one guy's the sign 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.199
 leaves the stadium goes to the satellite in that 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.569
 half way someone with an antenna 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.829
 parabolic captor that he did not think 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.269
 What can not even do today in 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.060
 day with the signals coded at the time 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.700
 of the face do not know why speech recording 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.680
 I still do not know why. 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.639
 he put on the air a year and a half after right 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 this was recorded in 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.780
 2007 at the time of america canopy and only 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.490
 aired in early 2009 and so did not 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.020
 has had no repercussions at all 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.909
 much greater repercussion of the Pauline saint 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.469
 who can only have rogério ceni like theirs 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.210
 with the myth this whole thing and when 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.169
 Someone's talking about rogério, we 're a god. 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.150
 call us 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.259
 then some games soon after 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.120
 I went to Morumbi 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.889
 entering the press sector someone 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.110
 arrived well complained to play ball of 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.150
 paper but it was also a very 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.729
 Short then he had no problem 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.800
 Conditional it was a truth I 'm 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.449
 referring not specifically to the figure 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.770
 of the rogério ceni but there is an interview 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.270
 he was giving us tava 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.680
 waiting to get in the air and also has 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.629
 who know what to play são paulo and santos 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.219
 that day he was giving this 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.960
 interview I was following not 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.779
 had enough wait hours yesterday such 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.400
 The rogério ceni is annoying I do not know what is 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.110
 seeing that moment that interview 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.759
 thought I was talking and think that 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.439
 it's kind of boring gorgeous same year 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.560
 no I think there's something to be mean 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:25.199
 half arrogant half pedantic so more 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.139
 the master is to find himself the king of the 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.939
 black coconut but it is not part of it 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.259
 nothing like that because as I said 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.849
 I do not know the rogério ceni. 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.139
 I personally never talked more than 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.219
 five minutes with him not being that 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.259
 interview the day he spoke at the 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.539
 then I have no program and how 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.039
 so his quality as a player as 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.169
 athlete excels at any other type of 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.300
 assessment is this is a question that every 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.699
 world does since the goal in the cup final 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.289
 of the world 2010 announced to the world 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.990
 who would be thinking about retirement 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.669
 after the 2014 World Cup here in Brazil that 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.729
 everyone worries who will be the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.560
 successor but knows that in fact these 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.430
 two things the first retirement of the 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.169
 what he said is actually 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.149
 that the 2014 Cup should be the last 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.319
 his world cup but it is obvious that he 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.240
 will not stay out of the Olympiad on the river 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.430
 January is his city then 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.319
 effectively to the Olympics and go and 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.819
 will probably continue after this 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.199
 narrating to the globe doing events 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.539
 anyway I think very little 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.689
 likely that it will definitely stop 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.669
 but we 'll still think about this 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.520
 the possibility that will narrate - or 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.399
 do not do the big events and such 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.669
 inside the globe that I usually hear 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:35.069
 is that the globe does not intend to have a 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.470
 I gongo a guy to your butt understood 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:40.500
 that this should be a bit more 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.850
 is diversified 10 among the 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.110
 Narrators who normally watch TV Globe 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.150
 uses but it's obvious nobody can be 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.280
 cover the sun with the sieve, it is obvious that the 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.980
 face ax has a tv shoot globe 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.110
 Luis Roberto still on the river screen 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.760
 which obviously put them in front of the 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.710
 others do not have the slightest doubt that 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.390
 I imagine that I luiz carlos júnior 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.070
 that she from the river also in the sportv that 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.410
 has also narrated on the globe 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.320
 we will have more possibilities 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.340
 of naha globe events but not 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.010
 imagine that we will stay the four 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.610
 on the same level of possibility within 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.610
 of the globe at last
