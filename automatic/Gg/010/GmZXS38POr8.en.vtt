00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello everyone today on my channel 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.340
 regular review of the next fixes 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.230
 today it is fixed by the company amassed juice 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.830
 I often have companies 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.299
 channel specifically this instance 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.570
 arrived for my friend from the city 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.510
 Moscow or in the coming days this knife 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.220
 go to him let's see what 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:32.870
 this is a pint knife a year from 14 m is normal 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.390
 Pentagon is not cut down version for Russia 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.879
 standard pint new year 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 Taiwan production 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.590
 so let's take a look in the box 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 then everything in the box is folded in such 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.480
 here's a plastic seal there we see 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.430
 bottom case well, in principle, the dagger itself 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 actually call it just a knife 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.969
 quite difficult because all the same 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.589
 this is a dagger let's see what it means 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.640
 we have here we have here with you 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.229
 good quality which is necessary 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 which mount is made under 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.220
 a mole system here we have 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.520
 small pocket for multitool 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.270
 either for a snare on size after all for 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.009
 multitool 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 and here we have ourselves a sheath what is 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:35.280
 here's a plastic insert if you can 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 observe means wear on going in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.729
 the whole thing is locked in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.189
 buttons + velcro that nowhere is nothing 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.020
 loose sticky stick off first 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.409
 next we have a button 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.810
 Well , let's say so I like me 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.500
 of course like kaideksa you and sheath 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.020
 I asked that I look for him to you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 and you need to actually have them but worth 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.189
 not really decent money therefore 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.030
 it was decided that we take the standard 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.970
 bundling here but now what can I 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.340
 say here by this knife 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.599
 need actually u 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.129
 unsuccessful very high quality made 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.480
 very nice grip shape 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.090
 that until the first time I 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.400
 supported this knife hands it seemed to me 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.670
 that it is a very traumatic knife that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.670
 very likely that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.629
 the wedge pops up but actually having 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.060
 This is the shape of the blade handle 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.030
 tightly fixed in the hand 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.030
 at least reverse grip even direct grip 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.640
 even fencing grip even so 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.519
 here with a palm rest here we give 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.269
 let's talk a little bit about you 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.019
 dagger means the length of the blade here 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.920
 with you 125 millimeters 12 centimeters 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.920
 our cutting edge begins well and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.180
 here is much less and here 10 up on 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.110
 in fact two and a half centimeters 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.840
 eaten here by this notch 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.630
 this one and in principle this one 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.910
 part of the knife is actually made more 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.880
 neatly than the old version but has 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.850
 a thinner tip is actually a tip 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.090
 enough thickness is enough here 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.400
 for even picking something else so much 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.940
 here aus-8 produced the whole thing in 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.190
 taiwan 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.889
 actually a cult knife in many 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.620
 movies in many TV shows of the early 1990s 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:44.200
 two thousandths this knife doesnâ€™t figure 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.930
 less than the same halo and other knives 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.510
 there was even a whole movie I have a good one 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.069
 friend before pasha who is literally today 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 I was reminded of this movie 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.730
 I do not remember the name where 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.249
 a cop kissing he was a maniac he 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.280
 repaint the whole family like this 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:08.319
 pentagon what is remarkable dagger 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.150
 that he is not really cold 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.980
 Russian law 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.769
 I've already heard about what's in the certificate 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.380
 a special mark that the letter r should 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.750
 be I unfortunately did not give up in 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.300
 studying this issue but nonetheless 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.060
 I think for the transfer of the Russian mine 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.669
 certificates will be enough actually 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.789
 grip here is still enough 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.400
 traumatic 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:36.190
 behind . we are not two-way here 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.810
 one of the parties is completely a surreytor 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.990
 serreytor very qualities such 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.210
 about how not to dare to give here and that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.190
 does it automatically 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.139
 at least according to our legislation 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.259
 this is what a raiter does ours 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.960
 tourist that's why here's 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.300
 a great knife like that 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.910
 convenient such rubberized handle 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.310
 we see the inscription juice everywhere 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.630
 quality and notching pleasant 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.349
 here but there really was some kind of 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.860
 story 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:12.030
 that the pentagon and the care and the guy broke 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.380
 he had three things there 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.750
 somewhere there was such a story in my opinion 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.449
 I wonâ€™t remember the Hansa now 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.039
 less I have seen such knives and now 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.389
 Recently, in our region was 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.970
 US military base and there I am 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:31.000
 several times saw such knives in the military 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.770
 and in fact they were in such as 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.240
 Well 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.520
 able to be seen with knives 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.550
 worked long enough at that 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 that's where I saw 1 from the broken line 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.400
 up to 5 millimeters tip everything else 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.860
 always been in place that's so nice 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.650
 dagger, I can even be very 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.569
 pleased with this plastic 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.680
 insertion and no big deal what they 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:59.330
 made of nylon from cordura 1000 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.729
 here is actually a very nice thing 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.699
 to sit down to turn around 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.919
 spinning just magically very comfortable 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.349
 very well executed actually 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.349
 I would not like to name the version at all 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.919
 have here the knife sits in the hand very 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:18.409
 well that bare hand that glove here 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.550

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.289
