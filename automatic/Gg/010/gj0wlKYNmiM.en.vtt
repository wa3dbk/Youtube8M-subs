00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
don't know if it came with it or not but

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.860 
don't know if it came with it or not but
this<00:00:44.900> little<00:00:45.170> rubber<00:00:45.470> piece<00:00:45.770> right<00:00:46.070> here

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
this little rubber piece right here

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.660 
this little rubber piece right here
there<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:47.989> go<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.530> little<00:00:48.980> raw<00:00:49.160> piece<00:00:49.430> right

there didn't have it so I think that was

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.310 
there didn't have it so I think that was
one<00:00:55.130> reason<00:00:55.160> why<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.670> didn't<00:00:56.030> work<00:00:56.510> but<00:00:56.870> anyways

it's what you got to do though is oh by
the<00:01:29.329> way<00:01:29.450> like<00:01:30.409> if<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.709> may<00:01:30.859> seem<00:01:31.279> if<00:01:31.490> know<00:01:31.700> you

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
the way like if you may seem if know you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.519 
the way like if you may seem if know you
felt<00:01:32.149> this<00:01:35.529> this<00:01:36.529> is<00:01:36.709> not<00:01:36.889> a<00:01:36.950> completely<00:01:38.529> soft

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:39.529 
felt this this is not a completely soft

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:42.160 
felt this this is not a completely soft
case<00:01:39.979> as<00:01:40.639> you<00:01:40.880> can<00:01:40.999> see<00:01:41.209> it<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:41.659> it's<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:42.020> little

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
case as you can see it so it's a little

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.039 
case as you can see it so it's a little
hard<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:42.889> i<00:01:42.979> mean<00:01:43.479> overall<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.719> will

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
hard but i mean overall it will

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.769 
hard but i mean overall it will
definitely<00:01:45.560> protect<00:01:46.359> definitely<00:01:47.359> a<00:01:47.389> see<00:01:47.630> if<00:01:47.689> i

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779
