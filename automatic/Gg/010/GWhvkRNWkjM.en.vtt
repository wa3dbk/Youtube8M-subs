00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.029
 hello friends today we are going to learn to 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.000
 recycle a glass jar for 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.180
 Moroccan decoration the materials are 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 the glass pot painting for the 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.820
 interior painting three-dimensional for 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.820
 decorate and a piece of graph paper 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.160
 let's fill the pot inside of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.160
 painting 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.330
 in this case blue color 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 if we see that the paint is very thick 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.240
 we can help with a brush to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.810
 to extend 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.810
 our painting 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.750
 we extend the paint well we throw well 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.760
 that is covered inside 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.760
 the boat we let it dry 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 we are with 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.280
 well let's go to 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.180
 to paint with the relief painting in 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.110
 this case is golden 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 I'm going to do 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.390
 A line 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.939
 perhaps 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.420
 the part of the thread 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.399
 discover it 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.240
 but for chunks why 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.240
 the paint runs off 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.929
 we'll let it dry then we make another 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.929
 piece 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.310
 you have to do it to small pieces flat 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.410
 so that the paint does not run off 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.000
 depending on the paint you use 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.869
 try it like this 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 Now what we are going to do is guide us 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.090
 by a grid and we will make a point 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.090
 other 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.270
 dots 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.730
 and we will do the same 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 the drawing you want 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.410
 in this case, the paint squeezed 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.870
 down 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.870
 we can fill it with dots 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.909
 and let dry this side when 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.900
 dry we pass to another side as we do the 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.900
 same drawing 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:32.040
 both the top one and the one below 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.040
 we already have the dry paint now we can 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 here 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.099
 the paper we have already removed the paper and now 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.120
 it's dry we can decorate our 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.360
 Moroccan style home we can put 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.450
 inside a candle to make a portal 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.819
 candles whatever you want I hope you have 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.650
 liked if it's like that be generous give it to 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.650
 I like and share God
