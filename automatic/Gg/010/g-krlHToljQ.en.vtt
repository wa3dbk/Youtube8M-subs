 Thin guy 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.900
 Taking a little bit at first, feeling that went this paste this 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.280
 Wet because that I do not want to dirty their hands in the back of the lid 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.280
 But it's okay with the back of the hand 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.840
 Adjust the color and flatten the tip of the atos brush here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840

 And then I think of all right pencil type without'm vip down the end descriptor Darn 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:35.829
 If there is a person who is there, it's just the bottom of the bone in the darkest place with that pencil. 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.090
 Because I do not think of my editing type 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.610
 I used dip down, but the dip group is so various from 9 minutes 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 Easy to do 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.310
 Is good 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.590

 And this Is the concealer in between this little to blend me cat 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.769

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.769
 Then 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.600

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:52.570
 Well this is gold but this is 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:56.670
 It's pretty old, but it's not like it, but it's like this kind of blow 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:02.040
 I put the blue salmon at the end 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:05.070
 But it's okay, but it's a shame. 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:12.050
 I'm a clear mascara of cover girl 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:12.050

 You can make it or you can use gold- based heat

 It's all right if you go with that light brown and no light beige 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:57.860
 But the very first um Step 1 is that 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:03.230
 I will write the lower one firmly with a slightly darker color 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:08.270
 Deato is speaking all the way to Aishado their favorite color pick 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:11.600
 You should take that god blond person from blond well
