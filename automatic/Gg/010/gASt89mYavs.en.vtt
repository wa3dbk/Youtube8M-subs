 all three mp4 or all is possible with new ones coming today 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.630
 not welcome in the day seven from the top 30 2 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.550
 today goes with you visitors of the animals in black ops two are just one 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.800
 few general announcements first a few the general rules the chocolate and 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.660
 many pelvis from little boy and she looks like a normal 2 sec 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.789
 contractor pennies 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 has a few advantages also has a few disadvantages of course because each 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.699
 advantage has a disadvantage as Johan Cruijff always said 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.829
 The advantage of this is that you have few campers and who is sitting here was the 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.660
 mill will be these video campers 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.720
 who then went to look like in a house they saw with the shotgun from the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.710
 share pocket 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.920
 because they were better with that, they were better off shooting and others 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.310
 involved it was of course one thing that the that 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.580
 he just shot eastkil to use that there was a group 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.510
 The world's richest growers are a metal and the image is still partly to do with 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.140
 that in this field is not saying what the only times of everything if they don't 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.810
 sex medically when they are on sales 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.250
 is that you don't like them as it bernt evens secondary that if you are on them 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.090
 can use 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.700
 one of the names gets incredibly handy to mill flares February could be as if 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.290
 you want 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.300
 he was simply extinguishing the map but you could do a whole lot like me 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.960
 sleeping large files 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.080
 so only twelve preferably because when you are in a breath 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.969
 in the field of movie campers 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.049
 the cow that is going to fmm fair with the show am a regular and 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.529
 thick bullet for a moment and then the other but is a shame like that the 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.229
 kempen heavy unfortunately it is no longer possible but yes this is also an advantage like me 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.920
 said first of all you are the first to shop in black ops second and 12 16 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.730
 the and 12 16 is, I think, comparable to the and 10 14 murdering madrid it is one 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.659
 kind of protruding always black ops 2 so one thing that can shoot four times 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.450
 only he was able to shoot just a little faster than the stab had had himself 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.350
 even a substitute namely the substitute of the abandonment 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.960
 is the r8 170 and jazz 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.539
 this weapon from most looked to the game you can see who had it 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.409
 to put clotheslines exactly the same in the way of milo de or most 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.159
 milo directly but if you get a shot that shot 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.290
 shooting the dolls too far according to Volker was exactly the same 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.470
 the band was sort of sort of exactly the same and also soon again 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.670
 hurry up 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.880
 if Anna has exactly the same property, then probably the same ideas as the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.789
 makes sense 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.409
 according to eddy the sa heech a12 she goes 12 is just the replacement for the a8 12 it 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.579
 is of course also a 12 and the twelve is always knowing the twelve is 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.150
 I hit the ball at school and give a chance even in the attack 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.489
 works can sleep, so his weapon is fairly easy to use 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.529
 especially when you are just starting out 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:33.200
 if you are really well organized with the evening, it must be really good and it must be 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.080
 also a lot of time but as someone from 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.660
 we have some couples who would never have played fashion market 3 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.679
 come and handle it well again 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.500
 and I know how to spread is the replacement of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.910
 and it is certainly certainly not as fast as the number 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.659
 disguised madrid but that can also be like that of one thing that they really do 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.509
 as if it just really jumps in really unbelievably fast shiedam inside 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.740
 I'm not just saying funny 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.070
 eaten the cheese because we give the chance of course just an exact 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.889
 copy of the mill water that had eaten cheese 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.019
 that if a little together for stomach i hope you are a part of the if 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.909
 the profitable thumbs up is a nice short size of visitors 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.199
 two sizes disney hofveld later or even 8 past half past ten what in this episode 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.510
 upset because there was still something to do for my studies because I had to 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.869
 one by one kind of 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.259
 but because there is no evening of information and I have studies there 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.499
 wooden a little in error let that would go on and lasted until something from 10am 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.089
 and so I am now at half past ten 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.170
 do not comment on the robbery 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.209
 and you know for internet data a diving team and ratings that I will 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:33.829
 all do it 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.719
 I totally want to find a mess of it and it looks like it in 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.880
 the past period 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.769
 really thank you in seven boys of 10,000 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.069
 Where the hell are we with this week I don't know anymore I want you too 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.630
 just thank you for the ladies 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.470
 an extreme the motivations that will probably be 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.790
 and being able to see that the population can be a quarter to eleven is already almost there 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.540
 take another bowl with this top 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.200
 and with this I say more guests here tomorrow
