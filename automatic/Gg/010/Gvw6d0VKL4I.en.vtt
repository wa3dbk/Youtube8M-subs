the microphone however it does have this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
the microphone however it does have this
unique<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.640> called<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> focus<00:00:54.539> control

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
unique thing called the focus control

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.340 
unique thing called the focus control
the<00:00:55.680> focus<00:00:55.860> control<00:00:56.539> slightly<00:00:57.539> changes<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the focus control slightly changes the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
the focus control slightly changes the
way<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.309> amount<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.640> voltage<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.239> being

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
way the amount of voltage that's being

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.529 
way the amount of voltage that's being
applied<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.500> condenser<00:01:02.250> element<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> if

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
applied to the condenser element and if

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.820 
applied to the condenser element and if
you<00:01:03.629> look<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> back<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> packaging<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you look at the back of the packaging it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.649 
you look at the back of the packaging it
looks<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.670> affecting<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> low-cut

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
looks like it's just affecting a low-cut

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
looks like it's just affecting a low-cut
and<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.040> happening<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and that is happening but there's a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.120 
and that is happening but there's a
little<00:01:09.960> bit<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> also

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
little bit more going on to that it also

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.280 
little bit more going on to that it also
affects<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> dynamic<00:01:12.510> range<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
affects the dynamic range of the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
affects the dynamic range of the
microphone<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.240> listening

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
microphone so right now we're listening

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
microphone so right now we're listening
to<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.110> microphone<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> focus<00:01:17.100> button

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to the microphone with the focus button

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
to the microphone with the focus button
disengaged<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.960> hear<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.290> got<00:01:19.409> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
disengaged you can hear it's got that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
disengaged you can hear it's got that
sort<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> big<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.540> larger-than-life

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
sort of big you know larger-than-life

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.859 
sort of big you know larger-than-life
sound<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.610> intense<00:01:24.210> proximity

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
sound that like really intense proximity

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
sound that like really intense proximity
effect<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:26.009> sort<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> signature<00:01:26.670> blue

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
effect that sort of signature blue

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.410 
effect that sort of signature blue
larger-than-life<00:01:27.840> vocal<00:01:28.380> sound<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:30.090> we

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
larger-than-life vocal sound so if we

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.100 
larger-than-life vocal sound so if we
engage<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.170> focus<00:01:31.470> effect<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.750> hear<00:01:33.930> now

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
engage the focus effect you can hear now

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.359 
engage the focus effect you can hear now
that<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.979> tightens<00:01:35.280> everything

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that it's it kind of tightens everything

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
that it's it kind of tightens everything
up<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:35.970> bit<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:37.110> almost

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
up a little bit there's a it's almost

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.630 
up a little bit there's a it's almost
sounds<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.890> we've<00:01:38.040> put<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> slight

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sounds like we've put a slight

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.730 
sounds like we've put a slight
compressor<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.470> light

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
compressor a really like light

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.399 
compressor a really like light
compressor<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.400> everything<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.930> doesn't<00:01:43.200> have

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
compressor on everything it doesn't have

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.920 
compressor on everything it doesn't have
quite<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> same<00:01:43.979> dynamic<00:01:44.549> range<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.329> does<00:01:45.630> cut

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
quite the same dynamic range it does cut

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.770 
quite the same dynamic range it does cut
a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.290> bit<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> those<00:01:46.619> lows<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:48.540> makes

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
a little bit of those lows out it makes

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.770 
a little bit of those lows out it makes
it<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.560> suitable<00:01:50.369> microphone<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.299> well

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it a very suitable microphone for well
