it just so happens I just got both of my
bows<00:00:14.849> reared<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> thought<00:00:16.440> before<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> put

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
bows reared so I thought before I put

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.450 
bows reared so I thought before I put
rosin<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.090> second<00:00:18.539> bow<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.960> would<00:00:19.770> let<00:00:20.430> you

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
rosin on my second bow I would let you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.150 
rosin on my second bow I would let you
take<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> look<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.449> try<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.689> show<00:00:22.020> you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
some stuff okay so here's my two bows I

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
some stuff okay so here's my two bows I
hope<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> difference<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
hope you can see the difference in the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.780 
hope you can see the difference in the
hair<00:00:28.920> color<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:31.019> -<00:00:31.260> well<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.130> know<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
hair color of the - well I know you can

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.290 
hair color of the - well I know you can
see<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> difference<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.520> basically<00:00:35.520> I've

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
see a difference and basically I've

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.270 
see a difference and basically I've
already<00:00:36.750> rosin<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.210> bow<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
already rosin this but this bow here and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.500 
already rosin this but this bow here and
so<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.460> hair<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.420> whiter<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.290> more

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
so it's hair is a lot whiter and more

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.350 
so it's hair is a lot whiter and more
dull<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.870> color<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.590> can't<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> light<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
dull in color I can't get the light to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.369 
dull in color I can't get the light to
catch<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:50.660> but<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.170> can

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
catch this one just right but if you can

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
catch this one just right but if you can
get<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.190> sunlight<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.660> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
get it in sunlight you can see that it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.520 
get it in sunlight you can see that it's
kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> glistening<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.899> it's<00:00:57.899> kind<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
kind of glistening and it's kind of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
kind of glistening and it's kind of
off-white<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.609> shiny<00:01:00.410> whereas<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
off-white and shiny whereas this is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.299 
off-white and shiny whereas this is
bright<00:01:02.609> white<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.290> dull<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.650> chalky

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bright white and kind of dull and chalky

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.780 
bright white and kind of dull and chalky
looking<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.799> that's<00:01:07.799> an<00:01:08.040> important<00:01:08.549> clue

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
looking and that's an important clue

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.750 
looking and that's an important clue
because<00:01:09.299> after<00:01:10.020> you're<00:01:10.950> playing<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.580> bow

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
because after you're playing on your bow

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 
because after you're playing on your bow
for<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> while<00:01:12.270> that's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.229> big<00:01:13.470> clue<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
for a while that's a big clue that you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
for a while that's a big clue that you
need<00:01:14.580> rosin<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> start<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
need rosin when you start to get that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.190 
need rosin when you start to get that
glisteny<00:01:17.130> shiny<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> know

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
glisteny shiny look again then you know

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.070 
glisteny shiny look again then you know
it's<00:01:19.350> time<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.650> rosin<00:01:20.250> again<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.880> sure<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's time to rosin again for sure now I

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
it's time to rosin again for sure now I
want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> show<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.549> bow<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.970> has

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
want to show you how the bow that has

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.890 
want to show you how the bow that has
not<00:01:24.330> yet<00:01:24.360> been<00:01:24.720> rosin<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:27.180> won't<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.780> able

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
not yet been rosin how it won't be able

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:39.830 
not yet been rosin how it won't be able
to<00:01:28.049> even<00:01:28.229> play<00:01:28.500> any<00:01:28.950> sounds

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.249 

it's<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.549> slippery<00:01:42.149> so<00:01:43.049> let's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's really really slippery so let's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.800 
it's really really slippery so let's
rosin<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.520> course<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.119> first<00:01:45.479> time

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
rosin it up and of course the first time

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.179 
rosin it up and of course the first time
you<00:01:45.960> rosin

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you rosin

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.389 
you rosin
Noori<00:01:47.850> hair<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> brand<00:01:48.689> new<00:01:48.869> bow<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.920> takes<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
Noori hair or a brand new bow it takes a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.730 
Noori hair or a brand new bow it takes a
lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.880> rosin<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.750> won't<00:01:51.990> ever<00:01:52.170> put<00:01:52.500> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
lot of rosin you won't ever put this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
lot of rosin you won't ever put this
much<00:01:53.039> on<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.520> again<00:01:54.240> most<00:01:55.229> likely<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.789> start

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
much on it again most likely so I start

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.850 
much on it again most likely so I start
down<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> Frog<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:59.520> cover<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.270> ferrule

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
down at the Frog and I cover the ferrule

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.999 
down at the Frog and I cover the ferrule
that<00:02:01.860> metal<00:02:02.220> thing<00:02:02.789> with<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.659> thumb<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.890> I

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that metal thing with my thumb so that I

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.880 
that metal thing with my thumb so that I
don't<00:02:05.539> you<00:02:06.539> know<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:06.899> chip<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.679> rosin

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
don't you know so I don't chip my rosin

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.609 
don't you know so I don't chip my rosin
on<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.670> metal<00:02:08.989> instead<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.050> let<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> run

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
on the metal instead I let it run

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.650 
on the metal instead I let it run
straight<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.819> thumb<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:15.239> way<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.420> can

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
straight into my thumb that way I can

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.789 
straight into my thumb that way I can
get<00:02:15.810> rosin<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:16.590> down<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> ferrule

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
get rosin right down to the ferrule

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.090 
get rosin right down to the ferrule
without<00:02:19.799> rosin<00:02:20.280> e<00:02:20.370> without<00:02:21.090> ruining<00:02:21.680> my<00:02:22.680> rosin

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
without rosin e without ruining my rosin

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.509 
without rosin e without ruining my rosin
and<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.780> scrub<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.069> work<00:02:26.280> it

and I really scrub it I like to work it
down<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.940> there<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.769> little<00:02:28.980> spot

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
down in there just in that little spot

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.460 
down in there just in that little spot
and<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.140> make<00:02:31.319> little<00:02:31.620> circles<00:02:33.019> just<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.230> work

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and I make little circles just to work

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.490 
and I make little circles just to work
it<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:35.130> down<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> ferrule<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:37.470> I

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
it right down to the ferrule and then I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.949 
it right down to the ferrule and then I
do<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:39.150> tip<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.290> same<00:02:40.560> way<00:02:41.360> lots<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.780> lots

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.280 
do the tip the same way lots and lots
and<00:02:43.200> lots<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.650> rosin<00:02:47.600> when<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.630> start<00:02:48.959> with<00:02:49.109> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and lots of rosin when I start with the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.069 
and lots of rosin when I start with the
ends<00:02:49.739> because<00:02:50.359> they<00:02:51.359> take<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:51.900> bit<00:02:52.019> of

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
ends because they take a little bit of

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.550 
ends because they take a little bit of
scrubbing<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.750> then<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:54.989> do<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.230> rest<00:02:55.380> of

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.600 
rotate your rosin as your rosin it won't
get<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.840> groove<00:04:37.229> in<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.100> you'll<00:04:38.250> wear<00:04:38.490> it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
get that groove in it and you'll wear it

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.570 
get that groove in it and you'll wear it
down<00:04:38.790> completely<00:04:39.419> flat<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.020> even<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:41.460> know

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
down completely flat and even you know

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.370 
down completely flat and even you know
the<00:04:41.610> groove<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.330> people<00:04:42.600> get<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.110> then<00:04:43.260> they

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the groove that people get and then they

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.409 
the groove that people get and then they
can't<00:04:43.620> use<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.460> other<00:04:44.610> half<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.300> their

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
can't use the the other half of their

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.240 
can't use the the other half of their
rosin<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:48.120> will<00:04:48.300> prevent<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:49.260> groove<00:04:49.680> from

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
rosin this will prevent that groove from

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.770 
rosin this will prevent that groove from
happening<00:04:50.669> if<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.380> keep<00:04:52.380> rotating<00:04:53.780> it's

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
happening if you just keep rotating it's

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.290 
happening if you just keep rotating it's
a<00:04:54.840> little<00:04:55.080> bit<00:04:55.200> tricky<00:04:55.940> now<00:04:56.940> while<00:04:57.180> I'm

it<00:05:33.240> was<00:05:33.419> probably<00:05:33.600> bugs<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.440> were<00:05:34.590> chewing

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950

sunlight<00:05:48.510> for<00:05:49.229> several<00:05:49.560> hours<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:50.070> will<00:05:50.430> get

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
sunlight for several hours that will get

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.940 
sunlight for several hours that will get
rid<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.910> bugs<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.510> you<00:05:52.080> should<00:05:52.350> be<00:05:52.470> fine

so that's what I did so if you
mysteriously<00:05:57.600> have<00:05:57.840> a<00:05:57.870> bunch<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.229> horse<00:05:58.470> hair

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
mysteriously have a bunch of horse hair

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.380 
mysteriously have a bunch of horse hair
showing<00:06:00.750> up<00:06:00.960> broken<00:06:01.289> you<00:06:01.950> might<00:06:02.159> have<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.700> bow

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
showing up broken you might have a bow

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.300 
showing up broken you might have a bow
bug<00:06:04.310> weirdest<00:06:05.310> thing<00:06:05.550> ever

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
bug weirdest thing ever

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.890 
bug weirdest thing ever
okay<00:06:08.310> so<00:06:08.370> I'm<00:06:08.970> really<00:06:09.270> putting<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.690> lot<00:06:09.720> of

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
okay so I'm really putting a lot of

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.310 
okay so I'm really putting a lot of
rosin<00:06:10.410> on<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.860> this<00:06:11.610> horsehair<00:06:12.210> is<00:06:12.480> kind<00:06:13.290> of

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
rosin on and this horsehair is kind of

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.130 
rosin on and this horsehair is kind of
resistant<00:06:14.030> it's<00:06:15.030> not<00:06:15.210> taking<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.930> rosin

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
resistant it's not taking to the rosin

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.670 
resistant it's not taking to the rosin
like<00:06:16.530> most<00:06:16.830> horsehair<00:06:17.400> I'm<00:06:17.550> used<00:06:17.730> to<00:06:17.880> but<00:06:18.680> it's

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
like most horsehair I'm used to but it's

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.400 
like most horsehair I'm used to but it's
different<00:06:19.890> every<00:06:20.220> time<00:06:20.990> okay<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.110> then<00:06:22.290> I<00:06:22.350> do

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
different every time okay and then I do

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.060 
different every time okay and then I do
a<00:06:22.500> couple<00:06:22.740> of<00:06:22.950> long<00:06:23.190> swipes<00:06:23.850> just<00:06:24.780> to<00:06:25.070> blend

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
a couple of long swipes just to blend

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.600 
a couple of long swipes just to blend
all<00:06:26.370> my<00:06:26.550> scrubbing<00:06:28.190> my<00:06:29.190> rosin<00:06:29.430> is<00:06:29.730> evenly<00:06:30.390> worn

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
all my scrubbing my rosin is evenly worn

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
then of course when I first play on this

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.180 
then of course when I first play on this
it's<00:06:51.060> gonna<00:06:51.240> leave<00:06:51.630> a<00:06:51.660> big<00:06:51.930> crusty<00:06:52.500> deposit<00:06:53.100> on

violin<00:07:00.090> it<00:07:00.330> will<00:07:00.630> adhere<00:07:00.840> chemically<00:07:01.740> to<00:07:02.070> your

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
violin it will adhere chemically to your

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080
