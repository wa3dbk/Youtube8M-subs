00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.480
 it was that in my childhood 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.410
 There's a lot of cool place for you to do. 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.629
 sport then it 's going to run around 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.790
 pick up a ladder pick up a lawn give 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.290
 through a rope to another and I 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.750
 I love it so it's one of the good things 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:15.500
 What to do in the city is dying for 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:19.340
 example that can take place in Brazil to 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.840
 My beautiful city that I love is a 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.990
 city ​​where I would like to create my 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.830
 children because it's a quiet town. 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.649
 city ​​of silence a city of emptiness 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.020
 no spaces brasilia is not this has a 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.630
 something bucolic someone has already spoken but in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.660
 a city is an asphalt farm 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.630
 I like this small town face. 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.750
 Do you know Brasilia is a great city 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.390
 small and I hope she never saw one 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.610
 small big city is a very 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.470
 good for artists to grow you 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.500
 how artist educate himself as an artist 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.720
 because art is beauty friend right in 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.179
 Brasilia is very beautiful so it's a 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.280
 beauty that is a little work you look at 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.490
 Talk what is beautiful but I think it too. 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.789
 that the cerrado teaches one thing about 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.099
 the beauty that is the beauty of crooked 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.550
 beauty of the ugly the beauty of thorn 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.880
 dry cactus of a round earth of the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.050
 dust from the stone and I think 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.270
 the person who learned to see beauty in it 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.770
 it is an aesthetic education that in a few 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.660
 places you will have that is not that 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.420
 easy beach beauty 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:38.020
 Ai Bird's Gull Beach is not a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.020
 Rustic beauty lasts but it's beauty 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.030
 the city was made for a year worth 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.560
 man is so inhuman and not so cold 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.930
 the city is here the banks are here 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.549
 only people who are not because they 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.920
 are not here and they are closed in 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.560
 home because you can not win and take 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.299
 a chimarrão no newspaper here has to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.189
 be all not only away from home 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.919
 I then think so in Brazil is 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.609
 son enjoyed by Brazilians 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:21.700
 Because the spaces are there for us. 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.849
 occupy only whether it is communist architecture 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.889
 people of the people but we forget 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.909
 And I was locked in the house seeing 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.519
 television 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.359
 but the city is waiting there for us 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.359
 to take her
