00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello to everyone, some with my first 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.539
 tutorial the cat old section see 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.670
 some fat guys I want in this look 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.029
 as you can see inspired 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.250
 of having frozen the new disney movie 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.109
 I liked this movie a lot but 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.449
 above all they were all 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.250
 time his beautiful trick of elsa ho 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.439
 tried to reproduce it and this the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.020
 final result is not a look 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.050
 therefore they are particularly difficult 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.690
 sure that you could very well reproduce it 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.480
 for carnival for a cosplay or for 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.340
 anything but you want to be 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.770
 passionate about cartoon animations 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.480
 animated to finish the match then straight 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.870
 I think this video will follow 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.879
 many other bonuses will follow many 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.500
 other similar spirits especially a 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.109
 feminism in other characters 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.050
 let me know who you would like to see and to 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.620
 next let's start immediately with the tutorial 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.870
 or already applied a base and now standing 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.110
 of the powder on the eye in a manner 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.000
 uniform to prepare my eyelid 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.300
 to the nuances 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.060
 ok now i have created this base 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.060
 powder for eyeshadow e 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.260
 pencil by drawing this pencil and by 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.320
 astra lizard for the lips to make a 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.230
 guideline for brownish nuance 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.180
 so that it does not come too much 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 disharmonious with the color of skin 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.750
 so a basis for a think technic 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.770
 of the poor because they were very capable ok 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.990
 at this point being the base well and the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.990
 Smudge with a flat brush 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.290
 ok assures me to blend the pencil well 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.390
 it doesn't have to be too precise because 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.650
 now we will go to the pencil with a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.420
 suitable eyeshadow with a pink eyeshadow 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.200
 from the palette 88 mat colors 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.460
 so what we do we concentrate on 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.860
 we focus the color above all on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.780
 pencil and sponge it towards the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.720
 eyebrows that I already have, however 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.250
 made of sumo more or less ok 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.730
 we continue to blur its engine 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.830
 of the aster and must be very much 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 therefore proud and very precise 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.250
 we realize with the movement of 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.040
 brush and not with a brush a 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.790
 nuance now we make the eyelid 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 I take a dark purple ellos eye shadow 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.260
 smoke on the sides of the eye to create a 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 three-dimensional effect 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.320
 if in fact you see the protagonist frozen 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 to this this very singer eyelid 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.920
 very nuanced 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.349
 that can be realized in various ways is 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.290
 this one is one of his ways the most 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.349
 therefore indicate both parts 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.879
 of the eye do not worry about 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.450
 fallout because then we'll clean everything 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.720
 to this it continues to fade 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.430
 both sides until they are 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.530
 satisfied in the effect at this point 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.230
 they will have an angled brush you can 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.030
 use any type of brush and from the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.080
 palette but in me with the heat collection 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.410
 they will have a bald purple to this 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.060
 moment I apply it to the center of the eye 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.799
 blending both parts of the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.760
 purple eyeshadow that I applied in 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.190
 previously there will be no way 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.819
 a cut too strong if you have this 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.319
 iridescent effect I was talking about ok here 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.269
 I take a brush and removes the fall 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.069
 out so that later when I go 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.220
 remove the under part in the eye not 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.329
 I will have too much product to take away 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.780
 continue the nuance continues his 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.780
 tough 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.410
 ok i finished it now by creating the pencil of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.180
 astra which I have already explained above 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.860
 and I apply it under the eye and then it 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.300
 vent scroll is more brighter to 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.819
 this very big my black pencil 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.709
 di zoeva is the first component of mind 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.780
 in the eye in fact elsa or an eye shadow 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.760
 however quite dark and even one 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.769
 a fairly dark line since a 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870
 character with a connotation also 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.960
 a little negative 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.960
 now I apply the mascara of absences that 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.730
 you know all and above and below 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.490
 creating a base for the vigilies the inter 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.160
 at this point I take a black eyeliner 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.090
 these diagnoses there but fate a dear 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.440
 friend flown and I got it glittered e 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.990
 draw a line and beg her on 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.690
 this line the false eyelashes use le 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.419
 threats are Chinese false eyelashes with one 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.100
 glue called charme 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.320
 ok rest off the lower part 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.440
 of the eye with micellar water but 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.740
 let's give the biphasic makeup remover something 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.890
 was continuing by applying the concealer the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.950
 team xd burned so it looks like an idiot 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.060
 and slowly with the monitor in Thuringia 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.340
 another dead 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.830
 we need to blend very well and in any case 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.770
 keeping the boundaries polite to this 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.190
 I take a lot of my coverage 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.350
 cosmetic femmes and a brush e 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.600
 incipio for the lower part 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:32.300
 of the eyes so as to create a 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.070
 continuous covering effect and to this 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.570
 point I make a little trick that 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.210
 they taught me the makeup course 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.300
 creating a flat brush and using 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.280
 a bit of concealer I better define the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.650
 eye shadow tail I prefer to do 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.400
 so instead of using the scotch that me 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:54.080
 seems an effective method but a bit lazy 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.419
 then I blur that finger the correction that 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.520
 I did and if you notice the case anyway 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.190
 look will look cleaner and more refined 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.320
 as you can see you can see a little more 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.180
 at the customer's hairline but 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.370
 is due to the liner that was released and 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.050
 to the glue that was still fresh 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.540
 don't worry personally 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.580
 detachment indeed will be minimally then 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.580
 thanks to oars following the next video
