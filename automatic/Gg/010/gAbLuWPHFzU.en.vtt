00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.989
 the teams certainly tightening a good start to the African championship 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.769
 we have a new coach so a new system a lot of new 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.599
 players I think it takes maybe a little lack adapt we know that 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.189
 it's very metallic 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.519
 the very important matches even though he thinks that 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.759
 this beginning of the season it is always important for Friborg to make 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.289
 a good start precisely found this this collision 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.169
 I think it's normal if this time to start I think we miss him 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.529
 it's the same year 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.230
 always run out of three five ten games which costs us 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.080
 many points 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.290
 so leave meaningless 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.219
 and as a 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.990
 more personal I think that 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.760
 Cuba at least good season 5% was happy with my fridge is fine 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 usually 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.979
 this moment is always better for banks 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.270
 try to follow this dynamic of equipped 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.249
 nhl 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.490
 for 100 th you have it 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.429
 the and v and m 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.999
 the week for now but never touched because it's still a goal 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.390
 it's clear that it is and it was first of all she knows that for you that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.880
 I think the harness 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.450
 in magic e2 now 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.220
 it was my goal there was 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.330
 a little bit of the two anti-bear leaders between 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
 the manga on this lost sleeve also shows who is who made me think 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.670
 there I was ready to take a step 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.120
 the word was really really too much 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.290
 Then I had to shoot in Switzerland these two 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.270
 de mormal remains 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.180
 here is the rehabilitation is to overcome a lot of time I do it 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.000
 still a season anyway so now 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.220
 imagine a little 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.760
 French in pre-season 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.170
 the gesture and season and launch alone 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.720
 it's already a chance that shows up why not I think he did 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120
 his 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.550
 actually by my big goal after that of passing the mass I 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.530
 think this is why not 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200
 same place 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 she's in a corner of the head ah of course I think it's still a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.230
 little here 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.910
 we may be able to benefit from this vote in weak in fact of the decline of the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.580
 request for this year in europe 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.520
 why do I think it's the same everywhere also interviews in March has 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.050
 been brought door-to-door to regret this it remains of 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.290
 europe a university that persists and signs his jacket to a goal is that 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.420
 his system 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.889
 not quite I think that 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.070
 some 25 years so I still have a few years of eclipses in front of me 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.880
 e i think a lot of helped out kyi great opportunities that are going to get 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.240
 introduce to the involved the world championships everyone even 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.180
 investigation for why not I think it's clear that with a change 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.450
 of coach like like his little sound sent to several that his 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.829
 shadow summoned to a little 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.230
 as on toulouse 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.440
 it's a good thing it brings competition so it's always a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.390
 goal for me is that it takes good times the Swiss team have emptied 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.649
 the two men also fell 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.869
 you are for the olympics I have the chance to participate this spirit 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.159
 general in the life of an athlete banks so far to continue to 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.259
 luxury but the Swiss team 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.379
 opposite 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.439
 well it's fun we promise to be hot this stage to tackle the year the 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.609
 title designed these slots 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.699
 by working in any rest to do this for people in a hurry to do 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:57.819
 petanque 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.959
 who what if it's waiting for us and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.699
 and also with the fabrics of problem but jersey about peace 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.699
 why not from to go as high as possible 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:08.099
 no
