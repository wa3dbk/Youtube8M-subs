 wire 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.000
 I will 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.570
 U 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 Ah 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.950
 we 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.310
 I would rather not 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.310
 Welcome fda The two other letter 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:46.070
 4 This time I do not even have to introduce the product by myself . 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.780
 The intuitive product that you are responsible for introducing today is Tesla's 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.430
 It's a vibrating temper. 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 The vibration wave is not a party yogeo heunhideul 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.690
 It looks simple to be more open. 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.879
 Just listen, and do so in a beautifully somyi able to hold the line, eh cast 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.720
 I think you could be righteous. 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:10.509
 I'm going to explain the concept of staircase not breaking . 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.649
 Vibration damper 1 like and do not want to be generated between the machine heads 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.149
 It is a product developed to prevent such string noise. 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.470
 He says he's pending. 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:25.149
 There is no more need to look great when you actually record this in the old charity 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.280
 As a user who has been using it at the time of recording , 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.560
 I think I can explain the feeling well . 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 It's just that it's just not good. 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.940
 It is a Goron product that you have to grasp and use . 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.280
 Here you see the wall, b poise 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.660
 And this is the reverse. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.289
 This is why you see so testing the noise coming out of the original John i 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.429
 Yaw damper, so Misty short-range noise when the Romans felt 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:58.819
 But I think he's got a little bit of a little bit of amplification right now. 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:02.810
 Do you think that your will is greatly reduced? 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.369
 If you look at the recorded under-wave, the noise itself gets so big. 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.280
 Basically, 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.410
 Now, in order to emphasize more, we need to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.610
 It seems to be a picture that has been amplified . 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.360
 Now these things are like bass or electric guitar solos. 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.260
 When the casting is that is has to save Joe Priest 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.040
 Your teeth may have experienced a lot of white noise. 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.730
 Geureongeo Expecting sleep is very efficient, especially those low bass 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.450
 As Sting ringing noise from the station would not really care iteusil 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:37.010
 Yogeo slip considerably products that help it Electric Guitar in Solothurn case 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.920
 The same thing that you do not need when you floss or something you put on your body. 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.290
 She will boil the baby properly. 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.129
 Instead, I just want you to put it in here and recommend it for use. 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.480
 Blow 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:53.250
 Now I can do this 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:58.470
 I just tried it with the Sant ton. 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.810
 It feels a little warm or something that catches some natural feeling 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.440
 I have a few features. 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 You neatly realize the ios of the neck , 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.810
 It's very helpful when you're recording your studio, but it's actually scratch 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:18.000
 Sound or natural budging is much more attractive. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:21.780
 It's rather natural when you play acoustic pink style or yoron 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.860
 You do not want to use it to get sting noise 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.010
 Sounds good . 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.580
 Why is that you utilize a lot of the time you'll use the same, complete 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.580
 I put it here. 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.580

 It was tempo. 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.090
