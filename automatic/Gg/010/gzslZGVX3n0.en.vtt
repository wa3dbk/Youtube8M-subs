00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.759 
about my ecookbook that's coming out
soon<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.940> slow<00:00:09.240> cooker<00:00:10.019> freezer<00:00:10.530> meals

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.470 
soon about my slow cooker freezer meals
and<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.519> wanted<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.880> take<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.030> little<00:00:12.240> bit<00:00:12.420> of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and so I wanted to take a little bit of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.900 
and so I wanted to take a little bit of
a<00:00:12.750> time<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.710> show<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> assemble<00:00:14.759> them

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
a time to show you how I assemble them

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.430 
a time to show you how I assemble them
because<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.540> that's<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.960> big<00:00:16.139> part<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
because really that's the big part of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
because really that's the big part of
the<00:00:16.529> concept<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.670> Assembly<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.210> all

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the concept is just the Assembly of all

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.330 
the concept is just the Assembly of all
the<00:00:18.840> ingredients<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.470> then<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.740> dump<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the ingredients and then you dump it and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.210 
the ingredients and then you dump it and
you<00:00:20.430> forget<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.080> super<00:00:22.500> time-saving

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you forget it and it's super time-saving

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
you forget it and it's super time-saving
and<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.390> really<00:00:24.720> great<00:00:25.080> easy<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.740> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and just a really great easy way to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460 
and just a really great easy way to
incorporate<00:00:26.539> freezer<00:00:27.539> cooking<00:00:27.750> into<00:00:28.170> your

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
incorporate freezer cooking into your

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
incorporate freezer cooking into your
life<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> first<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.949> label<00:00:32.880> my

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
life so first what I do is I I label my

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.680 
life so first what I do is I I label my
ziploc<00:00:33.600> bag<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.480> permanent<00:00:36.480> marker

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
ziploc bag and I use a permanent marker

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
ziploc bag and I use a permanent marker
but<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> buy<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> ecookbook<00:00:38.309> you're

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
but if you buy the ecookbook you're

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.280 
but if you buy the ecookbook you're
going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.000> super<00:00:39.300> cute<00:00:39.510> labels<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
going to get super cute labels that you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.610 
going to get super cute labels that you
can<00:00:40.730> click<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> your<00:00:42.120> bag<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.110> easier<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
can click on your bag so it's easier to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.020 
can click on your bag so it's easier to
write<00:00:43.829> when<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.129> flat<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.610> easier<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
write when they're flat it's easier to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
write when they're flat it's easier to
put<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> labels<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.719> their<00:00:46.020> flat<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
put the labels on their flat so if you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.130 
put the labels on their flat so if you
this<00:00:46.800> before<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.730> any<00:00:47.969> assembly<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.960> once

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this before you do any assembly and once

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
this before you do any assembly and once
you<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.550> I've<00:00:50.550> already<00:00:50.730> chopped<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you do that I've already chopped all of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
you do that I've already chopped all of
my<00:00:51.780> ingredients<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.469> clearly<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:53.039> do

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
my ingredients but clearly you would do

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
my ingredients but clearly you would do
that<00:00:53.219> before<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.940> would<00:00:54.149> dump<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that before you would dump it into the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
that before you would dump it into the
bag<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:56.190> once<00:00:56.370> you've<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.789> your

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
bag but once you've got all your

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
bag but once you've got all your
ingredients<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> matter<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
ingredients it's just a matter of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
ingredients it's just a matter of
dumping<00:00:59.070> everything<00:00:59.750> into<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.899> rag<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
dumping everything into your rag and it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
dumping everything into your rag and it
doesn't<00:01:03.420> matter<00:01:03.559> which<00:01:04.559> way<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
doesn't matter which way you do it you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
doesn't matter which way you do it you
could<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.659> carrots<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
could you know do your carrots first you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.370 
could you know do your carrots first you
could<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.770> last<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> doesn't<00:01:09.960> matter<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.290> all

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
could get last it doesn't matter at all

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.160 
could get last it doesn't matter at all
so<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.040> dumping<00:01:11.280> everything<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:12.170> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so you're just dumping everything in and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
so you're just dumping everything in and
I<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.439> love<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.979> park<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.880> always

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
sort of like an assembly line where I've

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.910 
sort of like an assembly line where I've
grouped<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.759> vegetables<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.509> spices

and<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.780> easy<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.349> just<00:02:34.500> put<00:02:35.069> all

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
and so it's really easy you just put all

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.390 
and so it's really easy you just put all
of<00:02:35.250> your<00:02:35.540> ingredients<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.799> then<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.190> zip

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
of your ingredients in and then we zip

of your ingredients in and then we zip
it<00:02:38.519> up<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:40.430> once<00:02:41.430> you've<00:02:41.549> got<00:02:41.700> everything<00:02:42.090> in

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
it up and once you've got everything in

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.490 
it up and once you've got everything in
I<00:02:42.629> sort<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.700> will<00:02:44.700> lay<00:02:44.879> everything<00:02:45.239> flat<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
I sort of will lay everything flat so

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.339 
I sort of will lay everything flat so
that<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.860> freezes<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.459> brick<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.349> you

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
that it freezes like a brick and you

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.190 
that it freezes like a brick and you
certainly<00:02:49.769> don't<00:02:49.980> have<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.489> but<00:02:51.200> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
certainly don't have to do that but it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.910 
certainly don't have to do that but it
saves<00:02:52.560> space<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:53.280> your<00:02:53.340> freezer<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.690> also

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
saves space in your freezer and it also

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.410 
saves space in your freezer and it also
just<00:02:55.920> makes<00:02:56.160> things<00:02:56.250> look<00:02:56.700> really<00:02:56.910> pretty<00:02:57.180> i'm

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
just makes things look really pretty i'm

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.890 
just makes things look really pretty i'm
totally<00:02:58.200> OCD<00:02:58.410> about<00:02:59.269> pantries<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.299> kitchens

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
and and things being organized so that's

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.080 
and and things being organized so that's
a<00:03:04.980> way<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> say<00:03:05.850> spaces<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.920> lay<00:03:08.069> flat<00:03:08.880> like

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
a way to say spaces to to lay flat like

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.199 
a way to say spaces to to lay flat like
a<00:03:09.120> break<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.980> there<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.400> there<00:03:11.849> is
