00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 you have to pay to cancel your account 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 have the money and be tomorrow in your 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.220
 house at the agreed time 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 I have your order, I'll pass through your house tomorrow 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.250
 As we agreed, we look at her still 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 I do not have the clear money that there may be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.329
 a little more than a few days what happens is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.540
 that my husband is still not paid 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.250
 carmen do not worry I understand you think 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.850
 that you can have the money spent tomorrow 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.760
 to deliver the products 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.500
 I think it's better on Wednesday even though you 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.640
 do you think you could come to my house tomorrow 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.640
 equal to leave me the product 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 never deliver the products to you 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.650
 client if you have not paid the order is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.240
 better reschedule a date for the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.240
 delivery of the order and payment 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.710
 I'm sorry Carmen, I can not better the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.120
 Wednesday I'm going to charge I'll take it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.670
 would be paola understand then we 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.370
 we see on Wednesday I give you the money and you 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.810
 You give me the delivery of my carmen order 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.880
 I failed with the payment date that 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.030
 we had agreed but you saw how 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.250
 I resolved kindly I proposed another 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.950
 payment date and ready 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.600
 we both won, it has happened to you that some 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.390
 Once a client has failed 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.909
 if it happens to you 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.070
 and avoid giving credits for very 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.470
 great I suggest a maximum of two 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.320
 Products per customer if the order is 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.450
 bigger divide it into two campaigns not 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 deliver any product if you do not 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.850
 cancel if you do it will be easier than 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.460
 try to avoid canceling your debt by 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.700
 that do not leave any product if you do not 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.770
 they finish paying 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.289
 and always asks for an advance in each 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.530
 requested so you ensure the commitment of the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.569
 client from the beginning find out 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.380
 who do I recommend it if it's a good 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.380
 payer 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.530
 Finally check your data and have the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.470
 always updated where he lives he works 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.540
 and your home phone numbers 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.700
 office and mobile you already know what you have 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.740
 what to do to collect your orders and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.500
 enforce delivery agreements and 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.660
 collection with customers 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.660
 Once you have closed the sale to your 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.520
 customers past your order for extranet and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.280
 delivered and charged the products 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.070
 do not forget to cancel the amount in the bank 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.050
 that appears on your coupon that amount is the 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.720
 of the sale to your customers less your 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.700
 discount percentage and taxes 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.550
 of law plus the cost of transportation 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.459
 remember to handle neatly the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.069
 Collection of your orders will allow you 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.709

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.110
 Credit commitments with yanbal will 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.090
 that your line of credit increases and 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.599

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.470
