00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 So in this video lesson, I suggest you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.870
 see which one should be used 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 equipment at first when you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190
 just starting to write your own 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.740
 podcasts no need to buy 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.350
 such dress special microphone 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 xlr deploy you can use here 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.090
 so here's one for which you can 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.769
 find in any store for 100 120 rubles 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.769
 I use this microphone xlr 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 connector that connects to the external 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.290
 sound card then and hut map the whole world 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.809
 lapel microphone which can be 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.780
 record high quality sound 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.800
 but all this equipment here together 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.870
 It costs about 9000 rubles for you these expenses 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.390
 At first, absolutely not needed 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.370
 so we will use this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 here is the microphone of a small refinement of the hour I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.280
 I will show what needs to be done in this 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.440
 microphone 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.309
 we will refine the focus 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.379
 sound wave 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.719
 how this is done is taken ordinary 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.539
 physical film to solid so she 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.270
 it was made with a small cone 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.090
 here it is tight so from the background here these 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 here are the sides the sound into the microphone did not arrive 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 on to the exit she goes cone-shaped and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 such 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.330
 opening we also leave free see 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.490
 yes for what it needs a system unit 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.909
 I have here right here below and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.700
 accordingly when i write 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.380
 Now we put this refinement done 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.990
 literally two three minutes 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.420
 You can glue tape so that it does not 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.040
 you fell constantly and when you will 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 write directing and in this way 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.310
 so that this wall is closed 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.890
 noise and that come from the system unit a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.750
 this wall was open was in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.939
 direct hit sound wave 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.799
 which comes when you speak and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.119
 record the sound that is such here 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.759
 modelku I recommend you use 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.740
 At first, in a separate video tutorial, I 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.380
 I will show you how to set up the recording correctly 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 sound on a computer using this 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.310
 devices you can write quite 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.920
 high-quality audio on your computer 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.380
 Anyway, at first, for now. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.149
 your adidas will not start making money 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.260
 or until you buy yourself more at 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.269
 south more professional 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.030
 equipment of course i recommend 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.890
 achieve high quality sound your 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.739
 voice quality recording your voice 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.769
 because it is very necessary nobody 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.230

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.390
 stress komi with excess amplitude and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.629
 so on then there must be quality 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.870
 caress let's say a rumor or at least as 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.180
 minimum not to cause additional 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.180
 some kind of negative emotions and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.680
 combined with content quality with 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.500
 useful information that you will 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.730
 give podcasts your podcasts will 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.980
 will be in demand 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.349
