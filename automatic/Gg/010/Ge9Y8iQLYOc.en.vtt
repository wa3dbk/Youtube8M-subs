00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello how am I on Thursday zdf of the first ticket sme and steve is little of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.490
 Easter 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.660
 d bishop more and now we will see the law needs 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.219
 this cessation of 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.239
 a few months ago 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.579
 i first 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.579
 I have to kill these enemies 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.260
 read the story be dead 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.050
 Now our typical 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.380
 with those 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.530
 type although the act 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 to the sixth the little one would go there is one 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.730
 and on the other side 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 several titles 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.440
 third countries 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 several thousands now from 4 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.160
 It is not the first time that the shooters on the other side 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.469
 bidasoa that for him v just in front of the first 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.469
 i will wait for you to ask me 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 there is one 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 and now we're going to the Venezuelans 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.830
 i 4 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 and now it goes well 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.580
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.040
 if you shoot too much walls to mutate on a wire 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.510
 that throws fire 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.450
 i 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 I do not know there's a lot of morality because if it's this 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 if it can kill you, you can throw 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.629
 but this one who kills her does not happen 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.829
 it just takes out luster Corinthians declared 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.249
 By the way in the wait grow or state 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.539
 this comment from the pair exist 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.569
 peking 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.349
 I explain
