00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.320 
metal flashing so what the roofer did
here<00:00:19.740> was<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.160> ran<00:00:20.430> their<00:00:21.439> roofing<00:00:22.439> paper

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
paper actually goes underneath the metal

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.299 
paper actually goes underneath the metal
and<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> white<00:00:33.360> arrows<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:34.110> pointing<00:00:34.739> oh<00:00:34.950> I'm

paper on and the white arrows are

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
paper on and the white arrows are
pointing<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.309> imaginary<00:00:44.309> path<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:45.149> water

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
pointing to the imaginary path of water

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.279 
pointing to the imaginary path of water
let's<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.739> say<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.250> raining<00:00:48.200> some<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
let's just say that it's raining some of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
let's just say that it's raining some of
the<00:00:49.350> water<00:00:49.530> gets<00:00:49.800> underneath<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.550> roofing

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the water gets underneath the roofing

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.170 
the water gets underneath the roofing
tiles<00:00:51.559> guess<00:00:52.559> where<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.910> going

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
tiles guess where it's going it's going

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.520 
tiles guess where it's going it's going
to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> roof<00:00:57.050> now<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.379> at

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
to be going down the roof now look at

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.160 
to be going down the roof now look at
this<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.890> isn't<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.430> steep<00:00:59.910> roof<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.079> you're

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this this isn't a steep roof so you're

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
this this isn't a steep roof so you're
even<00:01:01.230> gonna<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.620> bigger<00:01:02.039> problems<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
even gonna have bigger problems here the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
even gonna have bigger problems here the
water<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.650> roll<00:01:05.159> underneath<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
water will actually roll underneath the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.880 
water will actually roll underneath the
metal<00:01:07.520> find<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.640> hard<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> believe<00:01:09.090> well

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
metal find that hard to believe well

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
metal find that hard to believe well
trust<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> guy<00:01:12.689> they

call when they when they got water leaks
in<00:01:15.659> their<00:01:15.780> house<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.920> need<00:01:17.070> something

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
in their house and they need something

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.130 
in their house and they need something
like<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.670> fixed<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.930> one<00:01:21.930> other

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
like this fixed so there is one other

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.840 
like this fixed so there is one other
thing<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> roofers<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.580> they'll

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
thing that roofers will do they'll

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
thing that roofers will do they'll
actually<00:01:24.150> roll<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.200> paper<00:01:26.420> up<00:01:27.420> along<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
actually roll the paper up along the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.270 
actually roll the paper up along the
wall<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.960> instead<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> stopping<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
wall and instead of stopping it at the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
wall and instead of stopping it at the
wall<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.119> roll<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.079> run

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
wall they just roll it up and they run

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
wall they just roll it up and they run
it<00:01:34.470> behind<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:36.329> between<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.560> exterior

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it behind the in between the exterior

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.060 
it behind the in between the exterior
wall<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:41.180> metal<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.500> provides<00:01:43.890> them

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
wall and the metal so this provides them

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.620 
wall and the metal so this provides them
with<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.790> added<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.939> little

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
with a little added you know a little

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
with a little added you know a little
extra<00:01:49.020> protection<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.890> any<00:01:50.100> water<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
extra protection if any water was to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.010 
extra protection if any water was to
roll<00:01:51.740> behind<00:01:52.740> underneath<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> metal<00:01:54.020> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
roll behind underneath the metal it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
roll behind underneath the metal it's
going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:56.299> have<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.659> spot<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.159> roll

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
going to have a spot that it can roll

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.700 
going to have a spot that it can roll
down<00:01:59.880> safely<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.299> out<00:02:03.719> off<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
down safely you know out out off the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.459 
down safely you know out out off the
edge<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> roof<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.320> way

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
edge of the roof now with this the way

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.910 
edge of the roof now with this the way
this<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.660> water<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.500> actually

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
this is right now the water can actually

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.410 
this is right now the water can actually
roll<00:02:11.280> underneath<00:02:11.849> them

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
roll underneath them

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.970 
roll underneath them
and<00:02:12.830> into<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.220> house<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.599> can<00:02:16.260> always<00:02:16.620> put

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and into the house so you can always put

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.970 
and into the house so you can always put
some<00:02:17.160> tar<00:02:17.780> something<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:19.020> between<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.800> metal

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
some tar something in between the metal

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.500 
some tar something in between the metal
and<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.450> paper<00:02:21.620> roll<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> paper<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.510> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
and the paper roll the paper up it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.030 
and the paper roll the paper up it's
almost<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.290> I'm<00:02:25.380> trying<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> say<00:02:25.920> is

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.840 
almost like what I'm trying to say is
anything<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.120> especially<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.950> roof

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
anything but this especially on a roof
