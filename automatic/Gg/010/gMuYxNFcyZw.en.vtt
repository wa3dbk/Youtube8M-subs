folder<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:43.230> game<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:45.300> folder<00:02:45.690> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
folder in game then this folder and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.100 
folder in game then this folder and
there<00:02:47.280> should<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.519> any<00:02:47.730> boot<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.060> there<00:02:48.269> this

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
there should be any boot in there this

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.460 
there should be any boot in there this
is<00:02:49.260> where<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> lot<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.680> things<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.130> wrong<00:02:51.470> some

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
is where a lot of things go wrong some

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.370 
is where a lot of things go wrong some
people<00:02:52.500> say<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.100> um<00:02:53.610> eat<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.840> e<00:02:54.870> boot<00:02:55.200> does

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
people say that um eat the e boot does

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.640 
people say that um eat the e boot does
not<00:02:55.560> pop<00:02:55.769> up<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.190> there<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.580> if<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.959> does<00:02:58.260> not

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
not pop up in there and if that does not

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.960 
not pop up in there and if that does not
come<00:02:58.950> up<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.310> probably<00:02:59.519> because<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:01.970> CSO

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
come up it's probably because that CSO

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.350 
come up it's probably because that CSO
was<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.299> compatible<00:03:03.630> or<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.890> working<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.970> I

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
megabytes the after version it could be

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.289 
megabytes the after version it could be
a<00:03:57.879> much<00:03:58.329> larger<00:03:58.810> file<00:03:59.079> as<00:03:59.829> you<00:04:00.010> can<00:04:00.159> see<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:01.180> a
