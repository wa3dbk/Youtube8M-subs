to<00:01:32.810> be<00:01:32.900> taken<00:01:33.410> down<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.950> in<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.160> case<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:34.760> is

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
to be taken down and in this case it is

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.660 
to be taken down and in this case it is
for<00:01:35.390> transmitter<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.860> little<00:01:37.100> icons

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
for transmitter now the little icons

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.060 
for transmitter now the little icons
drop<00:01:38.090> down<00:01:38.330> below<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:39.050> I<00:01:39.200> believe<00:01:39.710> are<00:01:40.010> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
drop down below that I believe are the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.220 
drop down below that I believe are the
things<00:01:40.430> you<00:01:40.640> are<00:01:40.670> meant<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.120> be<00:01:41.270> taken<00:01:41.720> out<00:01:41.930> in

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
things you are meant to be taken out in

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.260 
things you are meant to be taken out in
that<00:01:42.500> specific<00:01:42.740> moment<00:01:43.160> like<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> things<00:01:44.090> you

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
that specific moment like the things you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.730 
that specific moment like the things you
are<00:01:44.300> meant<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.690> taken<00:01:45.110> out<00:01:45.200> during<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
are meant to be taken out during the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.380 
are meant to be taken out during the
face<00:01:46.010> and<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:46.700> kind<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.180> little

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
face and it's kind of like a little

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.690 
face and it's kind of like a little
achievement<00:01:48.110> thing<00:01:48.320> as<00:01:48.560> well<00:01:48.920> because<00:01:49.400> if<00:01:49.580> you

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
achievement thing as well because if you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.610 
achievement thing as well because if you
take<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:49.970> look<00:01:50.210> at<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.480> fourth<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:51.050> it's<00:01:51.290> kind

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
take a look at the fourth one it's kind

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.590 
take a look at the fourth one it's kind
of<00:01:51.740> like<00:01:51.830> some<00:01:52.010> little<00:01:52.130> gas<00:01:52.490> station<00:01:53.180> thing

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
of like some little gas station thing

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.780 
of like some little gas station thing
not<00:01:53.930> exactly<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.470> gas<00:01:54.890> station<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.580> know

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
not exactly a gas station but you know

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.680 
not exactly a gas station but you know
that<00:01:56.300> big<00:01:56.630> tall<00:01:56.960> tower<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:58.040> explodes

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
that big tall tower that just explodes

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.520 
that big tall tower that just explodes
dramatically<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.870> you<00:01:59.990> know<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.230> just<00:02:00.260> looks

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
dramatically and you know it just looks

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.210 
dramatically and you know it just looks
pretty<00:02:00.860> awesome<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.300> list<00:02:02.720> so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
pretty awesome that is on that list so

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.530 
pretty awesome that is on that list so
automatically<00:02:04.220> I'm<00:02:04.550> assuming<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.420> is

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
automatically I'm assuming that is

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.030 
automatically I'm assuming that is
something<00:02:05.900> right<00:02:06.170> now<00:02:06.380> at<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.800> base<00:02:07.010> that

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
something right now at that base that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.490 
something right now at that base that
Rico<00:02:07.640> needs<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.030> take<00:02:08.209> out<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.899> then<00:02:09.079> what<00:02:09.379> you

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
Rico needs to take out and then what you

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.339 
Rico needs to take out and then what you
see<00:02:09.530> on<00:02:09.920> your<00:02:09.950> bottom<00:02:10.429> left<00:02:10.670> hand<00:02:10.879> corner

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
see on your bottom left hand corner

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.500 
see on your bottom left hand corner
is<00:02:11.560> all<00:02:11.950> your<00:02:12.129> grappling<00:02:12.489> hook<00:02:12.849> at<00:02:13.030> Eva's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
is all your grappling hook at Eva's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.270 
is all your grappling hook at Eva's
whatever<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.959> want<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.230> say<00:02:14.439> and<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.129> can

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
whatever you want to say and as you can

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.089 
whatever you want to say and as you can
see<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.609> case<00:02:15.909> Rico<00:02:16.629> has<00:02:17.109> used<00:02:17.530> four<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
see in this case Rico has used four of

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.580 
see in this case Rico has used four of
them<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.549> only<00:02:18.760> has<00:02:19.090> two<00:02:19.420> left<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.439> on

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
them and only has two left and then on

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.349 
them and only has two left and then on
the<00:02:20.709> bottom<00:02:20.859> right<00:02:21.249> you<00:02:21.430> see<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.849> combat

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
the bottom right you see is a combat

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.239 
the bottom right you see is a combat
zone<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.989> weapon<00:02:23.319> he's<00:02:23.499> using<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.099> the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:24.249 
zone and the weapon he's using and the

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.830 
zone and the weapon he's using and the
ammo<00:02:24.609> he<00:02:24.790> has<00:02:24.969> and<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.299> course<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.659> can

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
ammo he has and of course you can

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.959 
ammo he has and of course you can
release<00:02:26.139> tethers<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:27.099> if<00:02:27.249> you<00:02:27.370> take<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.639> look

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
release tethers now if you take a look

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.240 
release tethers now if you take a look
at<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.359> Hut<00:02:28.689> you<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.109> see<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.439> is<00:02:29.650> completely

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
at this Hut you can see it is completely

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.099 
at this Hut you can see it is completely
different<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.120> big<00:02:31.299> reason<00:02:31.510> for<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.930> is

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
different and a big reason for this is

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.899 
different and a big reason for this is
kind<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.439> obvious<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.950> now<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.430> are<00:02:33.639> in<00:02:33.879> a

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
kind of obvious because now we are in a

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.339 
kind of obvious because now we are in a
very<00:02:34.299> cool<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.719> what<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.989> see<00:02:35.139> in<00:02:35.200> your

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
very cool and what you see in your

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.140 
very cool and what you see in your
bottom<00:02:35.590> left-hand<00:02:35.920> corner<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.609> your

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
bottom left-hand corner is your

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.479 
bottom left-hand corner is your
speedometer<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.019> then<00:02:38.349> in<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.680> case<00:02:39.010> as<00:02:39.250> he

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
speedometer and then in this case as he

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.459 
speedometer and then in this case as he
is<00:02:39.609> wanted<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.599> can<00:02:40.719> see<00:02:40.870> lost<00:02:41.169> visual

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
is wanted you can see lost visual

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.349 
is wanted you can see lost visual
contact<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> guess<00:02:42.579> kind<00:02:42.879> of<00:02:42.939> like<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> heat

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
contact and I guess kind of like a heat

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.569 
contact and I guess kind of like a heat
level<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.930> again<00:02:44.469> in<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.859> case<00:02:44.919> we<00:02:45.430> got

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
level and again in this case we got

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.420 
level and again in this case we got
freestyle<00:02:46.150> or<00:02:46.389> free<00:02:46.629> badges<00:02:47.079> now<00:02:47.469> going<00:02:48.099> into

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
freestyle or free badges now going into

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.909 
freestyle or free badges now going into
this<00:02:48.700> one<00:02:49.090> again<00:02:49.569> as<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.930> mentioned<00:02:50.379> before<00:02:50.439> it

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:50.919 
this one again as I mentioned before it

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.399 
this one again as I mentioned before it
all<00:02:51.219> varies<00:02:51.849> on<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.209> base<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.689> are<00:02:52.719> in<00:02:53.079> here

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
all varies on the base you are in here

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.159 
all varies on the base you are in here
we<00:02:53.590> actually<00:02:53.799> see<00:02:54.159> a<00:02:54.400> percentage<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.959> base

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
we actually see a percentage and a base

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.530 
we actually see a percentage and a base
name<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.859> how<00:02:57.069> much<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.579> damaged<00:02:58.090> right<00:02:58.329> now

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
name and how much is damaged right now

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.199 
name and how much is damaged right now
it<00:02:58.689> is<00:02:58.889> 25%<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.069> then<00:03:00.189> right<00:03:00.489> at<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.849> top<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
it is 25% and then right at the top the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.170 
it is 25% and then right at the top the
first<00:03:01.239> icon<00:03:02.019> does<00:03:02.260> say<00:03:02.530> wreak<00:03:03.219> havoc<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.000> then

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
first icon does say wreak havoc and then

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.089 
first icon does say wreak havoc and then
you<00:03:04.299> can<00:03:04.449> see<00:03:04.599> it<00:03:04.689> is<00:03:04.810> pretty<00:03:05.139> much<00:03:05.379> I<00:03:05.650> guess<00:03:05.919> a

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
you can see it is pretty much I guess a

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.479 
you can see it is pretty much I guess a
full<00:03:06.489> bar<00:03:06.790> below<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.959> says<00:03:07.989> zero<00:03:08.980> out<00:03:09.280> of

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
full bar below that it says zero out of

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.819 
full bar below that it says zero out of
one<00:03:09.669> jail<00:03:10.090> cell<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.689> then<00:03:10.840> zero<00:03:11.199> at<00:03:11.469> a<00:03:11.500> one

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
one jail cell and then zero at a one

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.209 
one jail cell and then zero at a one
call<00:03:12.189> in<00:03:12.489> rebel<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.359> basically<00:03:14.349> it's<00:03:14.829> kind<00:03:15.129> of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
call in rebel so basically it's kind of

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.890 
call in rebel so basically it's kind of
like<00:03:15.370> getting<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.849> a<00:03:15.879> hundred<00:03:16.269> percent<00:03:16.509> I

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
like getting it a hundred percent I

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.390 
like getting it a hundred percent I
guess<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.259> could<00:03:17.409> say<00:03:17.439> on<00:03:17.829> like<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.099> specific

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
guess you could say on like a specific

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.879 
guess you could say on like a specific
base<00:03:18.939> so<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:19.689> this<00:03:19.810> case<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.290> need<00:03:20.409> to<00:03:20.470> call<00:03:20.739> in

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
base so in this case you need to call in

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.619 
base so in this case you need to call in
a<00:03:20.979> rebel<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.519> then<00:03:21.639> you<00:03:21.759> get<00:03:21.909> that<00:03:22.090> one<00:03:22.299> point

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
a rebel and then you get that one point

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.899 
a rebel and then you get that one point
and<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:22.989> need<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.229> do<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> jail<00:03:24.129> cell<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.790> then

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
and you need to do a jail cell and then

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.999 
and you need to do a jail cell and then
you<00:03:25.060> know<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.509> another<00:03:25.780> point<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.349> again

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:27.009 
you know you get another point and again

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.069 
you know you get another point and again
it<00:03:27.280> varies<00:03:27.819> down<00:03:28.120> below<00:03:28.509> and<00:03:28.720> we<00:03:28.840> always<00:03:28.989> to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
it varies down below and we always to

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.589 
it varies down below and we always to
see<00:03:29.259> a<00:03:29.290> statue<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.040> second<00:03:30.430> icon<00:03:30.609> upward<00:03:31.299> so

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
see a statue the second icon upward so

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.960 
see a statue the second icon upward so
again<00:03:32.409> very<00:03:32.439> saying<00:03:33.099> you<00:03:33.250> need<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.489> go<00:03:33.669> take

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
again very saying you need to go take

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.360 
again very saying you need to go take
out<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.659> Ravello<00:03:35.049> statue<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.889> lock<00:03:36.009> it<00:03:36.189> down

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
out the Ravello statue and lock it down

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.129 
out the Ravello statue and lock it down
and<00:03:36.430> then<00:03:36.699> you<00:03:36.819> get<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.209> point<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.870> that's

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
and then you get that point so that's

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.800 
and then you get that point so that's
how<00:03:38.620> I'm<00:03:38.829> assuming<00:03:39.430> it's<00:03:39.609> working<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.629> me

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
how I'm assuming it's working and to me

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.140 
how I'm assuming it's working and to me
it<00:03:41.259> looks<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.680> lot<00:03:42.069> more<00:03:42.129> organized<00:03:42.879> because

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
it looks a lot more organized because

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.059 
it looks a lot more organized because
now<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.599> know<00:03:43.750> what<00:03:44.169> you<00:03:44.349> have<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.650> take<00:03:44.859> out

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
now you know what you have to take out

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.280 
now you know what you have to take out
in<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.400> game<00:03:45.609> compared<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:47.079> cause

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
in the game compared to and just cause

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.809 
in the game compared to and just cause
to<00:03:47.500> when<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.829> want<00:03:48.009> it<00:03:48.099> to<00:03:48.159> go<00:03:48.310> get<00:03:48.639> like<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
to when you want it to go get like a

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.249 
to when you want it to go get like a
hundred<00:03:49.000> percent<00:03:49.209> on<00:03:49.479> a<00:03:49.509> specific<00:03:49.780> area

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
hundred percent on a specific area

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.409 
hundred percent on a specific area
unless<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.859> save<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.189> air<00:03:51.370> pool<00:03:51.729> you<00:03:52.180> just

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
unless you save the air pool you just

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.719 
unless you save the air pool you just
kind<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.840> had<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.079> go<00:03:53.259> around<00:03:53.590> trying<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.340> blow

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
kind of had to go around trying to blow

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.729 
kind of had to go around trying to blow
everything<00:03:55.209> up<00:03:55.569> and<00:03:55.870> hope<00:03:56.079> that<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.439> get<00:03:56.560> some

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
everything up and hope that you get some

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.679 
everything up and hope that you get some
sort<00:03:56.919> of<00:03:56.949> percentage<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.669> it<00:03:57.819> but<00:03:58.060> hey<00:03:58.629> you

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
sort of percentage for it but hey you

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.719 
sort of percentage for it but hey you
now<00:03:59.139> know<00:03:59.349> exactly<00:03:59.500> what<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.280> are<00:04:00.430> meant<00:04:00.609> to

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
now know exactly what you are meant to

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.399 
now know exactly what you are meant to
do<00:04:00.909> and<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.180> probably<00:04:01.419> assume<00:04:01.989> it's<00:04:02.169> just<00:04:02.229> gonna

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
do and I probably assume it's just gonna

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.679 
do and I probably assume it's just gonna
be<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.739> matter<00:04:03.009> of<00:04:03.250> finding<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.239> again<00:04:04.509> as

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
be the matter of finding it and again as

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.390 
be the matter of finding it and again as
you<00:04:04.719> can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.229> all<00:04:05.409> varies<00:04:06.040> you've<00:04:06.250> got

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
you can see it all varies you've got

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.159 
you can see it all varies you've got
your<00:04:06.549> tethers<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.060> you've<00:04:07.539> got<00:04:07.689> your<00:04:07.900> list<00:04:08.049> of

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
your tethers and you've got your list of

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.319 
your tethers and you've got your list of
icons<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.769> what<00:04:08.919> you<00:04:09.039> need<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:09.310> do<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.789> it<00:04:10.180> is

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
icons and what you need to do and it is

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.240 
icons and what you need to do and it is
the<00:04:10.509> same<00:04:10.719> in<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.109> screenshot<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.889> the<00:04:12.099> one

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
the same in this screenshot and the one

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.129 
the same in this screenshot and the one
after<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.759> with<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.090> tank<00:04:13.509> again<00:04:13.750> you've

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
after that with the tank again you've

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.080 
after that with the tank again you've
got<00:04:14.169> your<00:04:14.379> speedometer<00:04:15.009> I'm<00:04:15.310> not<00:04:15.669> sure<00:04:15.909> what

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
got your speedometer I'm not sure what

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.939 
got your speedometer I'm not sure what
that<00:04:16.239> little<00:04:16.389> icon<00:04:16.630> next<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.289> it<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.680> if<00:04:17.859> you

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
that little icon next to it is if you

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.020 
that little icon next to it is if you
know<00:04:18.099> what<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.489> lemming<00:04:18.880> in<00:04:18.969> the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
know what it is lemming in the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.099 
know what it is lemming in the
conversation<00:04:19.570> below

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
conversation below

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.350 
conversation below
and<00:04:20.229> then<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.739> different<00:04:21.340> one<00:04:21.489> here<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:21.969> with

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
and then a different one here is with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360 
and then a different one here is with
your<00:04:22.569> helicopter<00:04:23.259> right<00:04:23.530> now<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.770> don't<00:04:24.129> see

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
your helicopter right now you don't see

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.740 
your helicopter right now you don't see
your<00:04:24.550> speed<00:04:24.879> but<00:04:25.090> it's<00:04:25.240> got<00:04:25.389> some<00:04:25.509> sort<00:04:25.659> of

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
your speed but it's got some sort of

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.869 
your speed but it's got some sort of
other<00:04:25.900> measurement<00:04:26.650> I'm<00:04:26.800> not<00:04:27.340> sure<00:04:27.550> if<00:04:27.669> that's

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
other measurement I'm not sure if that's

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.520 
other measurement I'm not sure if that's
about<00:04:28.120> your<00:04:28.300> height<00:04:28.539> or<00:04:28.750> something<00:04:29.199> and<00:04:29.349> then

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
about your height or something and then

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.649 
about your height or something and then
on<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.830> top<00:04:30.039> left<00:04:30.340> corner<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.909> believe<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.509> is

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
on the top left corner I believe it is

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.779 
on the top left corner I believe it is
possibly<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.289> location<00:04:33.039> now<00:04:33.159> about<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.610> HUD

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
playing the game in general we are gonna

playing the game in general we are gonna
have<00:04:42.069> to<00:04:42.219> map<00:04:42.400> either<00:04:42.639> on<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:42.969> left<00:04:43.000> or<00:04:43.330> bottom

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
have to map either on the left or bottom

have to map either on the left or bottom
right-hand<00:04:43.870> corner<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.740> know<00:04:44.889> although<00:04:45.219> we

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
right-hand corner and I know although we

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.369 
right-hand corner and I know although we
didn't<00:04:45.610> see<00:04:45.759> it<00:04:45.879> in<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.150> gameplay<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:47.199> main

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
didn't see it in the gameplay the main

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.110 
didn't see it in the gameplay the main
reason<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.860> think<00:04:47.889> that<00:04:48.189> was<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.669> case<00:04:48.849> is

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
reason I think that was the case is

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.390 
reason I think that was the case is
Pickers<00:04:49.449> they<00:04:49.659> don't<00:04:50.020> wanna<00:04:50.289> I<00:04:50.560> guess<00:04:50.830> spoil

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
Pickers they don't wanna I guess spoil

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.070 
Pickers they don't wanna I guess spoil
the<00:04:51.520> map<00:04:51.759> because<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.419> know<00:04:52.539> when<00:04:52.750> someone

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
the map because you know when someone

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.659 
the map because you know when someone
sees<00:04:53.319> like<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.620> tiny<00:04:53.919> bit<00:04:54.099> of<00:04:54.189> the<00:04:54.310> map<00:04:54.490> they

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
sees like a tiny bit of the map they

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.279 
sees like a tiny bit of the map they
somehow<00:04:55.120> come<00:04:55.389> up<00:04:55.479> with<00:04:55.599> like<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.930> rest<00:04:56.139> of

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
somehow come up with like the rest of

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.080 
somehow come up with like the rest of
the<00:04:56.409> map<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.770> don't<00:04:57.219> know<00:04:57.310> how<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.520> happens

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
the map I don't know how that happens

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.570 
the map I don't know how that happens
but<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.539> happens<00:04:58.569> so<00:04:59.229> again<00:04:59.979> that<00:05:00.189> is<00:05:00.219> also

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
but it happens so again that is also

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.040 
but it happens so again that is also
gonna<00:05:00.699> be<00:05:00.909> something<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.419> see<00:05:01.689> em<00:05:01.779> you<00:05:01.900> can
