00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.170
 Miguel was my 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.680
 I'll 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.110
 get started now being commented on the soy from psp 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.049
 tel because I come 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.389
 minister 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.669
 the passage of doing so 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.669
 they commented on australia 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.360
 for 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.040
 ps3s people thought everything else 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.489
 I think it's cool. 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.169
 do 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.470
 for this the pcp since it does not have enough difficult some such nor all 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.230
 world knows all the games 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.230
 so soon they started to comment and talk about 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 with inter-game launches with the old games 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.970
 but only 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.970
 the games that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.820
 here the staff usually 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 speak well everything else 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 the gender 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.100
 is not defined as such 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.840
 all kinds of games out there 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.870
 I realized starting with a 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.620
 the game has been released it's been a while 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 It's going to be a lot of fun, the graphics are not the best 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.390
 but for those who like tennis 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 bieler you can but you can make a good championship 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.490
 bad in the championship 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 playing to women and men 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.560
 you can do in no time like furniture and 21 points would be 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 you play 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.880
 the character 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 play against someone 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 if you with pcp 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.560
 and the career mode where you create your lime-like character 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.410
 and will play a championship and will train and everything else 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.969
 in relation to mobility 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.969
 He is very quiet, well, steps to play. 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.770
 arrows 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.770
 controls your character on the court 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.469
 hostile 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.469
 is used as 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.759
 continue to the ball 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.759
 at the final 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.579
 the earthquake 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 you bounce her high 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.569
 it contained 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:47.649
 the square 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.649
 helps you to make effects the right side 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 and ball defeats and made good defense 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.429
 that's the light player 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.349
 veto players to pl are players 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.349
 that there really are 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.949
 rat snakes tennis 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.859
 the ranking I think is hard 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.859
 last year 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.809
 but have not yet shouted at tennis 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 this year 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.999
 that's right 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.999
 meanwhile free even without playing time 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.819
 although the chart was not very good with him three months 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.739
 ef 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.739
 in this event 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.379

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.429
 finish 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.429
 without some curiosity about the rolls 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.199
 or on vertical promotions pr 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.459

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.990
 maybe even slightly optimistic 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.379
