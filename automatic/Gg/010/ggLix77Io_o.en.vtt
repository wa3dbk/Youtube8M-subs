00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello everyone, max, I will tell you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.559
 such a story from my life two years 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 back we moved north 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.780
 from here from bavaria southern bavaria itself 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.780
 southern point says say and 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.980
 Well, we lived there 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.390
 in the north 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.030
 how to say well 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.029
 climate yes let's say 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.150
 some let in Russia also that there 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.320
 maritime climate 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.320
 it's cold wind all the time 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.219
 Of course there is one when there is no wind 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.480
 as here of course is less than meters 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.329
 that's noticeable 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 And since the climate is so mild more 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.190
 softer climate than here in winter 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.840
 there is almost no frost so much 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.470
 maybe there a couple of days there will be snow all over 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470
 terrestrial all 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.540
 but this cold 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.840
 northern 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.840
 sea 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.740
 we lived there 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.340
 Well, how would I somehow care where to live 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 I lived there not lived we are not 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 trees to live in one place before 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.550
 who wants maybe 1 month i will not allow 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.680
 I wonder how not to travel 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.940
 everywhere will try because life is one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.260
 should know everything 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.260
 children like 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.870
 here and then we come here in two years 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.670
 moved back now here already 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.670
 we are settling down quietly 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.159
 however, and there as it were normal to 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.950
 but 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.950
 I have parents here 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.170
 and for my daughter as if 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:22.800
 grandfather grandmother is the most important thing 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.800
 they love my daughter very much their granddaughter 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:32.990
 but here I will tell you the advantage 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.990
 cons and pros of bavaria 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.920
 can be a little bit on the more advantages than 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:44.680
 but for me this is my general opinion 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.650
 sea â€‹â€‹1 to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.269
 adriatic sea italy here it is all 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.470
 how would close to Italy 300 kilometers 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.860
 from here from the north are going to rest in 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 italy 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.180
 respectively 1300 is already Aladdin 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.100
 sleep well of course blaze people who 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.200
 behind 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.160
 for all this for all the way 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.550
 so no what not no not started wickets 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:24.060
 Turkey and so just not all go without 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.060
 stops without pauses will be 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.630
 and I can't but this is not only because 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.300
 is it inside 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.290
 generally i'm talking 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.650
 do not be angry 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.450
 and to Croatia too 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.400
 let's go a little further 500 kilometers 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.920
 also a series is obtained 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.620
 ski resort 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.210
 too from there everything is north north here or 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.080
 on 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.640
 gadiz beautiful landscape actually on 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.180
 north how to say farther up 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.180
 reverse then minus 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.430
 here 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.730
 but in the north how to say there is easier 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.820
 maybe with some laws so here 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:22.620
 that for me fishing is very important i 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:26.450
 I fish a lot and in the north how is everything there 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.510
 cheaper here licenses are cheaper for fishing 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.080
 well, it's like 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.770
 so small-small 200 where 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.200
 what it is in life is not very important but 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.409
 anyway plus 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.989
 here of course more expensive all 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.229
 here post laws are more complicated about 

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:46.229
 fishing 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.529
 bavaria me 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:07.820
 what more are the fines here a little harder there on 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.910
 north let's say I could all winter 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.290
 on summer tires about nobody would drive me 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.370
 said nothing but here they can 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.370
 fine write out 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:29.979
 Well, so to speak, but here's another plus on 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.259
 north of what's cheaper there apartments 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:38.169
 example district so he is one hundred one hundred fifty 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.169
 euro well and even there hickey 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.600
 there are cheaper apartments 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.270
 for rent or 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.400
 and we buy houses from us here 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.450
 King 7 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.450
 if you want to buy a house 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:57.230
 but in thousands from 200 starting up to such 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.230
 small house 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.949
 in general, an average of about 300 thousand 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:13.380
 250 300000 and there the average is 150150 thousand 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:19.970
 now to 50,000 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:23.000
 difference also let's say cities depend 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:27.150
 oldenburg dear 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.130
 we can say the most expensive city to introduce 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:36.750
 Station Hydraxone is lower saxony 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:38.690
 here is the most expensive min hee hee not of course 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.360
 even more expensive 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:47.660
 I say that here the south is the most 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:50.210
 expensive area such here to do 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:55.360
 Tourists gather and tooth for tooth near 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.360
 also because of this, everything is expensive 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.900
 These are the pros and cons but this 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:08.780
 Of course not all the pros and cons I can 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:10.759
 go to list endlessly as if 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.830
 someone wants me to tell 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:15.460
