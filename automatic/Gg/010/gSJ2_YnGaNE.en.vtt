and when you do this it works really

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
well if you put conditioner by just a

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.680 
well if you put conditioner by just a

little light leave-in conditioner on
your<00:03:57.720> hair<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:59.450> it'll<00:04:00.450> make<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.720> hair<00:04:00.870> more

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
your hair and it'll make the hair more

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.990 
your hair and it'll make the hair more
pliable<00:04:01.140> I'm<00:04:01.980> not<00:04:02.190> gonna<00:04:02.400> do<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.760> right<00:04:02.970> now

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
pliable I'm not gonna do that right now

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.400 
pliable I'm not gonna do that right now
because<00:04:03.330> I'm<00:04:03.600> about<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.870> go<00:04:04.110> wash<00:04:04.380> my<00:04:04.620> hair<00:04:04.860> but

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
because I'm about to go wash my hair but

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.520 
because I'm about to go wash my hair but
basically<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:07.800> what<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.160> do<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:10.260> pull

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
basically this is what I do and I pull

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.740 
basically this is what I do and I pull
the<00:04:10.680> hair<00:04:11.090> all<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.150> way<00:04:12.420> down<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.380> point

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the hair all the way down to a point

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.840 
the hair all the way down to a point
because<00:04:15.750> when<00:04:16.440> as<00:04:16.709> your<00:04:16.919> hair<00:04:17.130> grows<00:04:17.400> out<00:04:17.609> you

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
because when as your hair grows out you

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.560 
because when as your hair grows out you
can<00:04:18.030> tell<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:19.169> it's<00:04:20.070> not<00:04:20.549> healthy<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.239> if<00:04:21.359> it's

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
can tell if it's not healthy and if it's

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.650 
can tell if it's not healthy and if it's
damaged<00:04:22.080> because<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:23.190> should<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.640> thick<00:04:24.330> all

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
damaged because it should be thick all

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.200 
damaged because it should be thick all
the<00:04:25.020> way<00:04:25.110> down<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.250> telltale<00:04:26.789> sign

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the way down so a telltale sign

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.659 
the way down so a telltale sign
when<00:04:27.509> you<00:04:27.660> need<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:28.020> trim<00:04:28.289> is<00:04:28.590> when<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.430> hair

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
when you need to trim is when that hair

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.930 
when you need to trim is when that hair
starts<00:04:29.970> getting<00:04:30.330> really<00:04:30.509> thin<00:04:31.259> down<00:04:31.770> here<00:04:32.100> so

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
starts getting really thin down here so

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.680 
starts getting really thin down here so
what<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.389> do<00:04:34.100> since<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.310> cut<00:04:35.490> my<00:04:35.639> hair<00:04:35.820> every<00:04:36.210> six

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
what I do since I cut my hair every six

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.460 
what I do since I cut my hair every six
to<00:04:36.750> eight<00:04:36.960> weeks

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
to eight weeks

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.450 
to eight weeks
I<00:04:37.620> always<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:38.669> trim<00:04:38.970> just<00:04:39.509> a<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:40.380> bit<00:04:40.560> so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
I always just trim just a little bit so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:51.080 
I always just trim just a little bit so
let<00:04:42.000> me<00:04:42.090> get<00:04:42.240> closer<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:49.710> as<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:49.979> can<00:04:50.100> see<00:04:50.160> I'm

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.820 

that's<00:04:57.539> where<00:04:57.810> all<00:04:57.900> my<00:04:58.110> single<00:04:58.380> strand<00:04:58.770> knots

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
are and I have just eliminated them and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.490 
are and I have just eliminated them and
now<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.680> hair<00:05:04.979> is<00:05:05.099> cut<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.870> section<00:05:07.199> is

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
for each section some sections are worse

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.870 
for each section some sections are worse
than<00:05:18.090> others<00:05:18.449> there<00:05:19.410> are<00:05:19.560> areas<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:20.220> my<00:05:20.370> hair

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
that get more single strand knots than

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.939 
that get more single strand knots than
other<00:05:23.970> sections<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.750> always<00:05:25.349> try<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.560> pull<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949

other sections I always try to pull the
hair<00:05:26.160> out<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:26.910> most<00:05:27.120> natural<00:05:27.300> way<00:05:27.599> that

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
hair out in the most natural way that

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.339

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
noticed that a lot of times if I pull it

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.279 
noticed that a lot of times if I pull it
straight<00:05:34.889> out<00:05:35.099> like<00:05:35.430> this<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:36.630> is<00:05:36.840> how<00:05:36.870> I<00:05:37.050> get

all the way down to the smallest point
where<00:06:22.259> it<00:06:22.380> starts<00:06:22.650> to<00:06:22.800> get<00:06:22.949> thin<00:06:23.280> and<00:06:23.310> frayed

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
where it starts to get thin and frayed

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.659 
where it starts to get thin and frayed
and<00:06:24.150> I'm<00:06:24.930> going<00:06:25.169> to<00:06:25.320> cut<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:26.159> off<00:06:27.409> so<00:06:28.669> the

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
and I'm going to cut that off so the

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.360 
and I'm going to cut that off so the
front<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.240> try<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.780> be<00:06:31.380> very<00:06:31.409> careful<00:06:32.190> with

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
front I try to be very careful with

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.120 
front I try to be very careful with
because<00:06:33.300> I<00:06:33.630> don't<00:06:33.930> want<00:06:34.169> it<00:06:34.289> to<00:06:34.500> fall<00:06:34.770> at<00:06:35.099> a

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
because I don't want it to fall at a

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.750 
because I don't want it to fall at a
weird<00:06:35.610> angle<00:06:36.229> so<00:06:37.229> usually<00:06:38.010> when<00:06:38.219> I<00:06:38.250> cut<00:06:38.639> the

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
weird angle so usually when I cut the

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.220 
weird angle so usually when I cut the
front

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
front

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.100 
front
I<00:06:40.400> cut<00:06:41.400> the<00:06:41.640> smallest<00:06:42.180> amount<00:06:42.630> off<00:06:42.870> of<00:06:42.900> the

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
I cut the smallest amount off of the

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.010 
I cut the smallest amount off of the
front<00:06:43.380> and<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:44.010> wait<00:06:44.220> until<00:06:44.670> it<00:06:45.090> is<00:06:45.360> curly<00:06:45.990> and

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
front and I wait until it is curly and

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.050 
front and I wait until it is curly and
then<00:06:46.290> I<00:06:46.320> go<00:06:46.590> in<00:06:46.830> and<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.100> look<00:06:47.130> at<00:06:47.490> it<00:06:47.520> a<00:06:47.670> second

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
then I go in and I look at it a second

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.300 
then I go in and I look at it a second
time<00:06:51.110> the<00:06:52.110> front<00:06:52.410> usually<00:06:52.800> grows<00:06:53.070> a<00:06:53.190> lot

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
time the front usually grows a lot

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.950 
time the front usually grows a lot
slower<00:06:53.610> than<00:06:53.730> the<00:06:53.940> rest<00:06:54.120> of<00:06:54.270> my<00:06:54.420> hair<00:06:54.450> so<00:06:54.900> I

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
slower than the rest of my hair so I

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.520 
slower than the rest of my hair so I
usually<00:06:55.200> don't<00:06:55.590> have<00:06:55.800> to<00:06:55.980> cut<00:06:56.220> very<00:06:56.430> much<00:06:56.700> off

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
usually don't have to cut very much off

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.660 
usually don't have to cut very much off
and<00:06:58.530> I<00:06:58.650> don't<00:06:58.710> have<00:06:58.980> to<00:06:59.100> cut<00:06:59.280> it<00:06:59.400> very<00:06:59.580> often<00:07:01.670> so

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
and I don't have to cut it very often so

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.850 
and I don't have to cut it very often so
once<00:07:03.000> I<00:07:03.150> do<00:07:03.210> my<00:07:03.360> wash<00:07:03.750> and<00:07:03.960> go<00:07:04.080> I<00:07:04.350> can<00:07:04.530> go<00:07:04.560> back

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
once I do my wash and go I can go back

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.970 
once I do my wash and go I can go back
in<00:07:05.100> and<00:07:05.580> while<00:07:06.150> this<00:07:06.300> curly<00:07:06.900> I<00:07:07.110> will<00:07:07.620> cut<00:07:07.800> each

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
in and while this curly I will cut each

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.830 
in and while this curly I will cut each
individual<00:07:08.550> curl<00:07:08.820> because<00:07:09.060> this<00:07:09.420> part<00:07:09.690> is

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
individual curl because this part is

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.650 
individual curl because this part is
kind<00:07:10.020> of<00:07:10.140> weird<00:07:10.350> and<00:07:10.620> I<00:07:11.040> need<00:07:11.250> it<00:07:11.370> to<00:07:11.460> fall<00:07:11.700> kind

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
kind of weird and I need it to fall kind

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.580 
kind of weird and I need it to fall kind
of<00:07:12.750> like<00:07:12.870> this<00:07:13.490> so<00:07:14.490> I'll<00:07:14.850> go<00:07:15.000> back<00:07:15.150> in<00:07:15.390> and<00:07:15.660> I'll

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
of like this so I'll go back in and I'll

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.570 
of like this so I'll go back in and I'll
cut<00:07:16.860> it<00:07:17.010> like<00:07:17.460> that<00:07:18.020> so<00:07:19.020> that<00:07:19.980> is<00:07:20.190> pretty<00:07:20.370> much

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
cut it like that so that is pretty much

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.740 
cut it like that so that is pretty much
how<00:07:20.640> I<00:07:21.380> trim<00:07:22.380> my<00:07:22.410> hair<00:07:22.560> and<00:07:23.540> those<00:07:24.540> are<00:07:24.690> the

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
how I trim my hair and those are the

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.700 
how I trim my hair and those are the
three<00:07:24.990> methods

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
three methods

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.670 
three methods
