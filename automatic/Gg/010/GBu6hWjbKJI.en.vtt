in<00:00:04.690> this<00:00:04.930> video<00:00:05.140> we're<00:00:05.920> going<00:00:06.069> to<00:00:06.220> add<00:00:06.310> an<00:00:06.430> eye

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.550 
in this video we're going to add an eye

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.860 
in this video we're going to add an eye
sockets<00:00:07.060> and<00:00:07.270> then<00:00:08.260> I<00:00:08.410> to<00:00:08.469> our<00:00:08.830> character<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
sockets and then I to our character to

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.230 
sockets and then I to our character to
do<00:00:10.990> this<00:00:11.139> once<00:00:11.440> I<00:00:11.559> add<00:00:11.769> now<00:00:12.010> another<00:00:12.790> polygon

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
do this once I add now another polygon

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.150 
do this once I add now another polygon
this<00:00:13.480> time<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:14.290> perimeter<00:00:14.679> i'm<00:00:14.830> going<00:00:15.040> to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
this time the perimeter i'm going to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.010 
this time the perimeter i'm going to
pick<00:00:15.340> is<00:00:15.580> a<00:00:15.639> sphere<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.390> size<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.930> the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
pick is a sphere now the size of the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.109 
pick is a sphere now the size of the
sphere<00:00:20.320> i'm<00:00:20.800> going<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.189> change<00:00:21.430> that<00:00:21.579> to<00:00:21.700> one

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
sphere i'm going to change that to one

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.179 
sphere i'm going to change that to one
for<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:22.840> radius<00:00:25.470> i'm<00:00:26.470> going<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.890> keep<00:00:27.040> the

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
for the radius i'm going to keep the

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.460 
for the radius i'm going to keep the
axis<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:27.880> hike<00:00:28.180> divisions<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.779> same<00:00:29.050> i'm

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470

going<00:00:29.680> to<00:00:29.770> God<00:00:29.919> creates<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.720> at<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.869> moment

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
going to God creates now at the moment

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.040 
going to God creates now at the moment
you<00:00:32.320> can't<00:00:32.590> see<00:00:32.890> my<00:00:33.100> character<00:00:33.640> if<00:00:34.360> I<00:00:34.570> go<00:00:34.780> into

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
you can't see my character if I go into

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.619 
you can't see my character if I go into
y4m<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.969> can<00:00:37.120> actually<00:00:37.239> see<00:00:37.420> it<00:00:38.199> is<00:00:38.379> there<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
y4m you can actually see it is there and

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.840 
y4m you can actually see it is there and
I'm<00:00:40.750> going<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:40.960> move<00:00:41.199> it<00:00:41.350> up<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.350> outwards

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I'm going to move it up and outwards

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.529 
I'm going to move it up and outwards
slightly<00:00:45.850> will<00:00:46.719> go<00:00:46.809> back<00:00:46.929> to<00:00:47.079> shared<00:00:47.350> in

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
slightly will go back to shared in

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.529 
slightly will go back to shared in
you'll<00:00:49.539> see<00:00:49.570> now<00:00:51.149> where<00:00:52.149> my<00:00:52.179> eye<00:00:54.449> socket<00:00:55.449> is

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
you'll see now where my eye socket is

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:02.189 
you'll see now where my eye socket is
going<00:00:55.749> to<00:00:55.870> be<00:00:59.100> in<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.309> attribute<00:01:00.399> editor<00:01:01.199> I'm

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
going to be in the attribute editor I'm

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.360 
going to be in the attribute editor I'm
going<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.620> change<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:03.010> name<00:01:03.039> of<00:01:03.399> my<00:01:03.429> sphere<00:01:05.370> to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
going to change the name of my sphere to

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:14.950 
going to change the name of my sphere to
eye<00:01:10.590> sockets

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.109 

so<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:15.740> we<00:01:15.830> know<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.340> our<00:01:16.549> eyes<00:01:16.790> I

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
so that we know that that is our eyes I

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.270 
so that we know that that is our eyes I
sake<00:01:17.869> that<00:01:18.080> we're<00:01:18.200> going<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.440> have<00:01:18.590> now<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
sake that we're going to have now this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.410 
sake that we're going to have now this
is<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.460> hole<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:19.850> we're<00:01:20.150> going<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.479> make<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
is the hole that we're going to make the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.560 
is the hole that we're going to make the
position<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:25.180> come<00:01:26.180> back<00:01:26.300> into<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
position of it come back into the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.990 
position of it come back into the
channel<00:01:26.780> box<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.380> want<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.369> make<00:01:28.700> these

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
channel box I want to make these

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.350 
channel box I want to make these
positions<00:01:29.890> quite<00:01:30.890> easy<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.580> translate<00:01:32.000> from

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
positions quite easy to translate from

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.570 
positions quite easy to translate from
his<00:01:32.509> head<00:01:32.659> position<00:01:33.140> there<00:01:33.380> I'm<00:01:33.409> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.460> put

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
his head position there I'm going to put

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.910 
his head position there I'm going to put
a<00:01:34.610> zero<00:01:36.159> which<00:01:37.159> moved<00:01:37.399> it<00:01:37.520> on<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> center<00:01:37.880> line

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
a zero which moved it on the center line

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.910 
a zero which moved it on the center line
my<00:01:40.119> Y<00:01:41.119> position<00:01:42.190> if<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.430> pull<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.350> 2.5<00:01:45.350> see<00:01:45.860> how

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
my Y position if I pull that 2.5 see how

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.969 
my Y position if I pull that 2.5 see how
that<00:01:46.100> looks<00:01:46.130> put<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.090> little<00:01:47.330> bit<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.690> war<00:01:48.020> going

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
that looks put a little bit to war going

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.770 
that looks put a little bit to war going
to<00:01:49.070> change<00:01:49.310> up<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.610> 2.6<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:55.880> translate<00:01:56.630> in

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
to change up to 2.6 and I translate in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.419 
to change up to 2.6 and I translate in
the<00:01:56.869> X<00:01:57.020> direction<00:01:57.679> which<00:01:57.830> went<00:01:58.039> backwards<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
the X direction which went backwards and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.630 
the X direction which went backwards and
forwards<00:02:00.580> going<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.700> try<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.210> at<00:02:02.530> minus<00:02:03.640> one

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
forwards going to try that at minus one

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.419 
forwards going to try that at minus one
point<00:02:05.090> three<00:02:06.729> miss<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.759> little<00:02:08.090> bit<00:02:08.179> bigger<00:02:08.360> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
point three miss a little bit bigger so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.080 
point three miss a little bit bigger so
the<00:02:10.429> moment<00:02:10.759> what<00:02:10.970> I've<00:02:11.150> got<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:13.000> looks<00:02:14.000> like

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the moment what I've got is looks like

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.990 
the moment what I've got is looks like
an<00:02:14.390> eye<00:02:14.769> sticking<00:02:15.769> out<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.400> want<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.700> do<00:02:16.880> is

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
an eye sticking out but I want to do is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.310 
an eye sticking out but I want to do is
make<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.390> into<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> socket<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.959> way<00:02:21.079> that<00:02:21.230> we

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
make that into a socket the way that we

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.039 
make that into a socket the way that we
can<00:02:21.470> do<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.060> select<00:02:23.299> both<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.840> my

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
can do this if I select both of my

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.970 
can do this if I select both of my
meshes<00:02:25.690> with<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.840> mayor<00:02:27.049> within<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.799> mesh

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
meshes with in mayor within the mesh

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.440 
meshes with in mayor within the mesh
command<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.150> something<00:02:29.329> called

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
command there is something called

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.400 
command there is something called
billions<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:32.000> rip<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.180> off<00:02:32.329> there<00:02:33.200> are

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
billions just rip that off there are

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.460 
billions just rip that off there are
three<00:02:33.680> times<00:02:34.010> we've<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> union<00:02:35.290> which<00:02:36.290> in

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
three times we've got a union which in

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.310 
three times we've got a union which in
my<00:02:36.620> slight<00:02:37.130> Union<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.910> will<00:02:41.060> join<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
my slight Union it will join the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.460 
my slight Union it will join the
characters<00:02:42.739> together<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.280> one<00:02:44.320> there<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.440> a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
characters together as one there is a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.860 
characters together as one there is a
difference<00:02:45.980> command<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.780> either

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
difference command but you can either

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.930 
difference command but you can either
select<00:02:48.110> both<00:02:49.810> let<00:02:50.810> me<00:02:50.959> edit<00:02:51.140> undo

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.180 

so<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.120> both<00:02:57.300> separate<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.100> click<00:02:59.100> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
so they are both separate I click the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.120 
so they are both separate I click the
difference<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:01.050> only<00:03:01.080> difference<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
difference the only difference is the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.100 
difference the only difference is the
outside<00:03:02.610> part<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> don't<00:03:03.420> want<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.050> if

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
outside part so I don't want that so if

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.960 
outside part so I don't want that so if
I<00:03:04.200> edit<00:03:04.700> undo<00:03:06.560> if<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.740> click<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.130> intersection

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.449 

again<00:03:14.970> what<00:03:15.360> I've<00:03:15.480> got<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
again what I've got there is the

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.240 
again what I've got there is the
intersection<00:03:17.850> part<00:03:18.240> of<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.890> what<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.040> need

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
intersection part of it so what I need

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.760 
intersection part of it so what I need
to<00:03:20.280> do<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:21.390> if<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.260> select<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.880> body<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
to do is if I select the body then the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.000 
to do is if I select the body then the
eye<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.730> use<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.150> difference<00:03:27.510> command<00:03:28.010> or

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
eye and use the difference command or

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.820 
eye and use the difference command or
you'll<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.550> now<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:31.140> I've<00:03:31.290> actually<00:03:31.470> got

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
you'll see now is that I've actually got

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.430 
you'll see now is that I've actually got
a<00:03:31.860> hole<00:03:32.269> inside<00:03:33.269> my<00:03:33.840> character<00:03:36.350> that's<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
a hole inside my character that's the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.720 
a hole inside my character that's the
one<00:03:37.590> quite<00:03:37.830> support<00:03:38.220> my<00:03:38.970> eye<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:41.370> now<00:03:41.519> we<00:03:41.580> need

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
one quite support my eye so now we need

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.360 
one quite support my eye so now we need
to<00:03:41.760> load<00:03:42.060> an<00:03:42.209> eye<00:03:42.330> into<00:03:42.720> my<00:03:42.959> character<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.769> do

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
to load an eye into my character to do

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.280 
to load an eye into my character to do
this<00:03:44.550> I'm<00:03:44.760> going<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.970> create<00:03:45.290> plugins

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
this I'm going to create plugins

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.870 
this I'm going to create plugins
primitives<00:03:46.860> sphere<00:03:48.410> now<00:03:49.410> my<00:03:49.620> last<00:03:49.830> radius<00:03:50.340> was

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
primitives sphere now my last radius was

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.820 
primitives sphere now my last radius was
warm<00:03:51.360> or<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.989> change<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:53.600> 0.8<00:03:54.769> as<00:03:55.769> a

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
radius and create and I need to remember

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:12.530 
radius and create and I need to remember
I<00:04:00.989> need<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.769> know<00:04:01.950> change<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:05.400> name<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:07.160> I
