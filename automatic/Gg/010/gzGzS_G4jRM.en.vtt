the<00:02:10.340> game<00:02:10.399> I'm<00:02:10.819> sure<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.330> levels<00:02:11.630> won't<00:02:11.840> be

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
the game I'm sure the levels won't be

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.590 
the game I'm sure the levels won't be
giving<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.350> as<00:02:12.500> many<00:02:12.680> hints<00:02:12.920> unlock<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.030> lift

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
giving you as many hints unlock it lift

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.780 
giving you as many hints unlock it lift
the<00:02:14.780> lid<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.250> beautiful<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.670> an

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the lid and beautiful there is an

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.400 
the lid and beautiful there is an
eyepiece<00:02:17.180> inside<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:19.270> curious<00:02:20.270> eyepiece<00:02:23.410> okay

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
eyepiece inside a curious eyepiece okay

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.060 
eyepiece inside a curious eyepiece okay
so<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.740> put<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.709> doesn't<00:02:27.890> do

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
so we put it on and it doesn't do

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.440 
so we put it on and it doesn't do
anything<00:02:28.280> perhaps<00:02:28.670> there's<00:02:29.180> something

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
anything perhaps there's something

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.960 
anything perhaps there's something
missing<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:30.230> does<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.500> note<00:02:30.680> say<00:02:30.820> okay<00:02:31.820> no

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
missing what does the note say okay no

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
missing what does the note say okay no
problem<00:02:32.270> we'll<00:02:32.420> put<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.660> eyepiece<00:02:32.930> away<00:02:33.200> for

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
problem we'll put the eyepiece away for

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.220 
problem we'll put the eyepiece away for
now<00:02:33.590> I'll<00:02:34.010> protect<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.400> note<00:02:34.660> feed<00:02:35.660> me<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
now I'll protect the note feed me and I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.290 
now I'll protect the note feed me and I
shall<00:02:36.440> survive<00:02:36.890> give<00:02:37.370> me<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> drink<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.209> I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
shall survive give me a drink and I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.500 
shall survive give me a drink and I
shall<00:02:38.630> die<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.220> riddle<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.090> answer<00:02:41.390> of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
shall die so it's a riddle the answer of

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.580 
shall die so it's a riddle the answer of
which<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.930> fire<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:44.540> solution<00:02:45.110> must<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:45.410> here

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
which is fire a solution must be here

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.150 
which is fire a solution must be here
somewhere

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
somewhere

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.000 
somewhere
so<00:02:46.670> pinch<00:02:47.090> together<00:02:47.300> zoom<00:02:48.080> out<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.470> let's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
so pinch together zoom out and let's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.150 
so pinch together zoom out and let's
look<00:02:49.130> for<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.430> answer<00:02:49.730> now<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.950> know<00:02:51.950> this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
look for the answer now I know this

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.130 
look for the answer now I know this
because<00:02:52.280> I've<00:02:52.550> already<00:02:52.850> done<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:54.019> you

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
because I've already done it but as you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.199 
because I've already done it but as you
can<00:02:54.230> see<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.769> feet<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.670> water<00:02:56.030> air<00:02:57.820> fire<00:02:58.820> and

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
can see the feet have water air fire and

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.540 
can see the feet have water air fire and
Earth<00:02:59.660> written<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.410> fire<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> answer

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
Earth written on it fire is the answer

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.820 
Earth written on it fire is the answer
to<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.730> riddle<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.510> we<00:03:02.690> gonna<00:03:03.050> pay<00:03:03.530> close

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
to the riddle so we gonna pay close

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.370 
to the riddle so we gonna pay close
attention<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.550> fire<00:03:05.360> wood<00:03:05.780> feeds<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.200> but

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
attention to that fire wood feeds it but

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.930 
attention to that fire wood feeds it but
water<00:03:06.590> puts<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.950> out<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.100> guess<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.610> should<00:03:07.760> give

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
water puts it out I guess I should give

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.500 
water puts it out I guess I should give
it<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.120> push<00:03:08.420> no<00:03:09.110> problem

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
it a push no problem

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.810 
it a push no problem
so<00:03:11.510> we<00:03:11.780> get<00:03:11.989> another<00:03:12.140> key<00:03:12.769> now<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.340> key<00:03:13.610> is

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
so we get another key now this key is

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.569 
so we get another key now this key is
quite<00:03:14.090> unusual<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.920> actually<00:03:16.220> has<00:03:16.370> two

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
quite unusual it actually has two

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.840 
quite unusual it actually has two
functions<00:03:17.290> peculiar<00:03:18.290> Alt<00:03:18.470> key<00:03:18.850> something

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
functions peculiar Alt key something

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.310 
functions peculiar Alt key something
about<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.239> should<00:03:20.299> take<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.600> closer<00:03:20.870> look

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
about it I should take a closer look

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.319 
about it I should take a closer look
so<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:21.709> tap<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.100> key<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:22.940> can<00:03:23.030> check<00:03:23.209> it

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
so we tap the key and you can check it

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.750 
so we tap the key and you can check it
out<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.959> we<00:03:24.079> can<00:03:24.110> rotate<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.799> end<00:03:24.980> as<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.610> can

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
out so we can rotate the end as you can

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
out so we can rotate the end as you can
see<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.440> will<00:03:27.640> open<00:03:28.640> two<00:03:28.910> types<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.360> locks<00:03:29.570> here

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
see it will open two types of locks here

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.210 
see it will open two types of locks here
no<00:03:30.470> problem<00:03:30.829> at<00:03:30.950> all<00:03:31.040> oh<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:32.329> sorry<00:03:32.980> we<00:03:33.980> press

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
no problem at all oh I'm sorry we press

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.250 
no problem at all oh I'm sorry we press
back<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.519> go<00:03:34.850> back<00:03:34.880> out<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.269> there<00:03:35.540> okay<00:03:36.340> now

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
back to go back out of there okay now

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.319 
back to go back out of there okay now
what<00:03:39.260> else<00:03:39.410> can<00:03:39.500> we<00:03:39.739> do<00:03:39.890> we<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.670> look<00:03:40.850> here

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
what else can we do we have a look here

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.979 
what else can we do we have a look here
oh<00:03:43.209> there's<00:03:44.209> something<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.660> end<00:03:44.810> here

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
oh there's something on the end here

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.930 
oh there's something on the end here
what<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:46.280> might<00:03:46.400> be<00:03:46.519> on<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.670> unscrew

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
what is that it might be on to unscrew

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.490 
what is that it might be on to unscrew
it<00:03:47.000> if<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.420> had<00:03:47.540> something<00:03:47.720> scruple<00:03:48.079> with<00:03:48.230> which

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
it if I had something scruple with which

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.009 
it if I had something scruple with which
we<00:03:48.620> don't<00:03:48.709> have<00:03:48.829> yet

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
we don't have yet

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.740 
we don't have yet
zooming<00:03:51.019> out<00:03:51.140> now<00:03:51.799> there<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.390> something

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
zooming out now there there is something

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.780 
zooming out now there there is something
odd<00:03:54.019> about<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.560> side<00:03:54.799> of<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:56.709> chest<00:03:57.790> we

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
odd about the side of this this chest we

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.250 
odd about the side of this this chest we
can<00:03:58.940> focus<00:03:59.180> on<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.780> actually<00:03:59.870> slide

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
can focus on this and actually slide

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.039 
can focus on this and actually slide
this<00:04:00.440> across<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.299> what<00:04:02.299> would<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.540> know<00:04:02.660> we

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
this across and what would you know we

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.039 
this across and what would you know we
have<00:04:03.370> locked<00:04:04.370> there

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.740 

there<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.140> go<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:08.530> now<00:04:08.709> have<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:10.480> 1/8<00:04:12.750> grave

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
there you go we now have the 1/8 grave

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.899 
there you go we now have the 1/8 grave
metal<00:04:14.140> plate<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.859> end<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.129> logic<00:04:15.430> we<00:04:15.609> use<00:04:15.730> as<00:04:15.879> a

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
metal plate the end of logic we use as a

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.670 
metal plate the end of logic we use as a
wrench<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.780> know<00:04:16.900> exactly<00:04:17.049> what<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.590> do

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
wrench so we know exactly what to do

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
mm-hmm I wonder what to do let's try the

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.999 
mm-hmm I wonder what to do let's try the
eyepiece<00:05:34.900> again<00:05:35.229> oh<00:05:36.150> we<00:05:37.150> now<00:05:37.300> have<00:05:37.509> something

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
eyepiece again oh we now have something

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.480 
eyepiece again oh we now have something
that<00:05:39.389> we<00:05:40.389> couldn't<00:05:40.630> see<00:05:40.780> before<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:42.310> now<00:05:42.430> you

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
that we couldn't see before so now you

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.719 
that we couldn't see before so now you
can<00:05:42.789> of<00:05:43.060> course<00:05:43.090> rotate<00:05:43.599> these<00:05:43.889> but<00:05:44.889> you<00:05:45.460> can't

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
can of course rotate these but you can't

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.490 
can of course rotate these but you can't
rotate<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.180> center<00:05:46.570> so<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.780> have<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:47.020> go<00:05:47.199> from

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
rotate the center so you have to go from

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.159 
rotate the center so you have to go from
the<00:05:47.650> center<00:05:47.889> out<00:05:48.599> matching<00:05:49.599> them<00:05:49.720> up<00:05:49.810> as<00:05:50.050> you

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169

the center out matching them up as you
go<00:05:50.349> and<00:05:52.349> hopefully<00:05:53.940> be<00:05:54.940> able<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.180> get<00:05:55.419> the

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
go and hopefully be able to get the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.950 
go and hopefully be able to get the
design<00:05:56.199> of<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.620> intended<00:05:56.979> design<00:05:57.400> here<00:05:57.960> like

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
design of the intended design here like

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.450 
design of the intended design here like
so
