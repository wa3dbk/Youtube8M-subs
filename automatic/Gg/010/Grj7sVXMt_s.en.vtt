00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.950
 hello I am a very driving instructor 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.840
 at the school scharfinger and you 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.430
 are super exercises what do we do if 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.430
 It's light in our motorcycle license 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.120
 and thanks to an ingenious invention called 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.350
 You will learn voice over exactly 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.410
 what he has to pay attention to in the exercises 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.850
 Let's start with a right turn 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.040
 Here you should the curve as closely as possible 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.369
 take and at the same time his balance 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.369
 respect, think highly of 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.090
 continue with the slalom here too 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.720
 is keeping the balance 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.720
 critical 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.800
 for relaxation, the 8 follows one 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.660
 simple exercise in the case of two times one 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.660
 night across the practice area drives 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.010
 then it goes with full throttle of it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.580
 and right back to the goal 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.580
 slow down 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.600
 This one should not be the target either 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.070
 run over as well as on one 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.360
 minimum speed of 30 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.360
 hourly kilometers 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.500
 It follows the dangers in the reason passes 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 this exercise just like the goal only with 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.220
 at least 50 instead of 30 kilometers per hour 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.520
 in both exercises, the so-called 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.170
 Hill as orientation towards the conclusion 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.180
 the dangers are avoided 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.710
 instead of braking and driving this time 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.360
 the obstacle again with one 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.330
 minimum speed of 50 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.980
 hours kilometers 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.810
 All exercises are completed together 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.090
 the driving school scharinger as parcours 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.890
 who on the instructions of the driving instructor 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.170
 also likes to hear one or the other 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.640
 Installing another gag will not be big 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.050
 problems with the exercises and the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.640
 to have passed the exam 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.640
 Well then good ride
