00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.699
 the second group of mental illnesses 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.880
 called dementias, which are the dementias 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.490
 food as if it were the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.949
 asymmetry of the single franchise because it is 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.769
 people who have developed well 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.150
 your personality to reach the fullness of 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.089
 your personality 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.089
 they were people who were to enter the world 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:42.930
 to join the company have had 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.870
 married profession and had a child 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.559
 produced more uncertain in the environment 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.589
 of life begin to loss same decay 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.010
 of all this ability to acquire up to 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.339
 so it starts like it's a slow 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.530
 decadence which, of course, to be 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.390
 against dementia is a decay 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.740
 normal pathological 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.229
 I told you that we all have a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.910
 biological decay we all arrived 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.150
 in a moment of life that we when 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.130
 we begin to lose capacity is not the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.900
 delight it is characterized by this 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.420
 despite everything that people 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.320
 acquired in childhood as a teenager and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.180
 in adult life 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.460
 of course it is part of a cycle 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.830
 and has nothing to do with 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.400
 illness itself but in 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 In some cases this normal decay of 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.680
 life it assumes pathological aspects 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.650
 when they a shop spatula 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.440
 we call pending be a loss 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.540
 progressive and all the capacity that the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.659
 person acquired when he formed his 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.180
 personality to a comparison that is 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.130
 interesting as follows: 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.800
 goalkeeper or phrenic is one who does not 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.950
 developed his personality is a poor 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.740
 ever enriched the demented ie 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.110
 that trend is one day that was the rich 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.210
 father began to lose his fortune 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.720
 depended on his ability and wanted to 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.259
 purchase 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.759
 So, but when can you? 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.899
 pathological as I say to a decay 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.630
 normal 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.220
 we saw a 90 year old man 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.290
 resident band where 20 and 80 years of 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 age realizes that it is a decadence 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.900
 gives physical strength to the possibility of 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.610
 learn new things in the ability to 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.610
 change your mind 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.590
 but this is part of the decay 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.990
 of the human being any being 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.910
 especially human biological 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.730
 when does she think that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.920
 this decadence is pathological and therefore 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.660
 will receive the emergency name at 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.720
 classification of dementia 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.760
 first when it is very early 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.290
 person of 50 and 60 years of age by 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.450
 example is the person who has full 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.850
 capacity even if there is no 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.550
 course accident 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.610
 she has full mental capacity 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.330
 she is able to accomplish things and create 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.970
 television and to invent of being 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.770
 activity if she wants to start a life 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.830
 new no problem 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.920
 however if there is at that age the person already 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.530
 begins to have difficulty already starts us 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.600
 we begin to realize that you can no longer 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.810
 more for example realizing things 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.090
 can not innovate anymore. 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.560
 can not create anymore can not 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.209
 build nothing 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.239
 possibly something going on 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.780
 so it was very early in May 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.060
 this normal loss of 80% 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.180
 years but now the 50 and 60 years 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.670
 it's already happening this is very early 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170
 In this case we'll call 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 likely to be a trend towards 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.850
 Alzheimer's disease is so there are staff 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.590
 60 years of age for example the person 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.299
 fully normal full capacity 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.820
 However, Cielo was restrained on leaving. 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.040
 we'll see she's no longer capable 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.410
 memory was committed to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.230
 initiative was compromised. 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.250
 critical judgment compromised the values 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.650
 they changed 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.410
 so are the 60 - year-old some 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.450
 thing is 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.040
 thinking wrong and we'll have more 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.350
 independence 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.630
 the second because it can happen to 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.720
 characterize the normal decay as 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.000
 pathological decay with dementia is the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.950
 fact of being very fast aging 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.620
 human is too slow 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.080
 we took a person of 50 and 60 from 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.180
 age we know that nowadays she 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.790
 have the chance to live in some 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.760
 over 80 years old and in our country 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.940
 In Brazil we are getting to 70 71 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.950
 being the unit with smartness of life 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.840
 This person has no life left. 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.800
 far ahead or life productive life 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.750
 good 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.620
 however we realize that it is very 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.720
 accelerated this decay between 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.700
 It has been 12 years and the person 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.070
 be a person with the forces in a 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.110
 caricature she was before 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.660
 potential to achieve can be 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.030
 to lose quickly by the ability to 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.700
 she had been losing herself quickly 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.040
 again called independence is okay 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.240
 seeing a very rapid decay that 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.340
 not expected 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.790
 we nowadays know that people 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.810
 reach age 90 so the ability 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.730
 entrepreneurs can reach 90 years of 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.970
 productive age 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.850
 however the person between 60 and 65 years 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.010
 old have begun to great loss 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.530
 of college quality 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.310
 this is considered normal is the type of 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.530
 dementia or third reason can be 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.230
 seem to table 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.700
 the prayer phenomenon that are not part of the 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.100
 normal old age 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.770
 normal old age the decadence of evil has 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.660
 some characteristics know this but 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.000
 looking at a 20- year-old is 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.919
 pretty 770 of age 80 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.260
 You know there are different have 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.140
 some different things but everything 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.910
 within the biological cycle human being 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.890
 however if you begin to present your 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.480
 name - which are not part of the cycle 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.880
 biological human being 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.130
 this time they're normal we can 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.010
 also called dementia for example 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.580
 usually the person is quite 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.520
 not start inventing things that are not 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.860
 begins to imagine things 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 already start imagining things to invent 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.699
 thing until our friend him the meaning 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.979
 not come to reality as it is 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.780
 change the reality we can love this 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.240
 Delight is no longer normal 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.620
 something happened our old age that 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.729
 is transforming an old age and 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.500
 pathological 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.729
 then this is another feature as well 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.729
 emergency of
