this<00:00:40.929> is<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.079> common<00:00:41.469> problem<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.829> lot<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.069> people

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
this is a common problem a lot of people

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.860 
this is a common problem a lot of people
in<00:00:42.460> New<00:00:42.550> Mexico<00:00:42.940> have<00:00:43.089> branches<00:00:43.510> that<00:00:43.600> break

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
in New Mexico have branches that break

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.629 
in New Mexico have branches that break
either<00:00:44.319> in<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.649> summer<00:00:44.920> or<00:00:45.190> in<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.339> winter

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:45.639 
either in the summer or in the winter

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:46.770 
either in the summer or in the winter
and<00:00:45.729> they<00:00:45.850> wonder<00:00:46.030> what<00:00:46.179> to<00:00:46.269> do<00:00:46.389> with<00:00:46.539> it<00:00:46.659> so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
and they wonder what to do with it so

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.329 
and they wonder what to do with it so
this<00:00:46.870> is<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.049> real<00:00:47.199> good<00:00:47.379> one<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:48.129> what<00:00:48.249> we

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
this is a real good one and what we

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.610 
this is a real good one and what we
looked<00:00:48.549> at<00:00:48.639> here<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:49.030> what<00:00:49.510> should<00:00:49.690> we<00:00:49.780> do<00:00:50.019> you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
looked at here is what should we do you

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.319 
looked at here is what should we do you
got<00:00:50.799> this<00:00:50.979> scar<00:00:51.339> here<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.819> could<00:00:51.969> cut<00:00:52.179> that

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
got this scar here you could cut that

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.879 
got this scar here you could cut that
off<00:00:52.539> but<00:00:52.899> that's<00:00:52.989> still<00:00:53.229> going<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.440> leave<00:00:53.620> a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:53.889 
off but that's still going to leave a

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:55.349 
off but that's still going to leave a
scar<00:00:54.069> on<00:00:54.459> the<00:00:54.639> underside<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.209> other

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
scar on the underside of the other

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.879 
scar on the underside of the other
branch<00:00:55.600> right<00:00:55.899> let's<00:00:56.229> probably<00:00:56.589> better<00:00:56.769> to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
branch right let's probably better to

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.819 
branch right let's probably better to
remove<00:00:57.159> that<00:00:57.339> whole<00:00:57.519> branch<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:59.530> cutting

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
remove that whole branch that's cutting

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.009 
remove that whole branch that's cutting
a<00:00:59.889> lot<00:01:00.039> out<00:01:00.249> but<00:01:01.179> looking<00:01:01.449> at<00:01:01.569> this<00:01:01.749> particular

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
a lot out but looking at this particular

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.979 
a lot out but looking at this particular
tree<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.769> right<00:01:02.979> next<00:01:03.159> to<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.369> fence<00:01:03.900> you've<00:01:04.900> got

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
tree is right next to a fence you've got

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.510 
tree is right next to a fence you've got
a<00:01:05.020> pole<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.470> runs<00:01:05.650> through<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.280> it's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
a pole it runs through it and it's

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.730 
a pole it runs through it and it's
awfully<00:01:06.970> close<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.750> yeah<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.260> so<00:01:08.500> you're

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
awfully close to it yeah and so you're

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.960 
awfully close to it yeah and so you're
gonna<00:01:08.830> have<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.100> problem<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.580> future<00:01:09.850> with

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
gonna have a problem in the future with

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.820 
gonna have a problem in the future with
that<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:10.930> it's<00:01:11.050> probably<00:01:11.260> better<00:01:11.410> to<00:01:11.530> remove

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
that so it's probably better to remove

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.170 
that so it's probably better to remove
that<00:01:12.010> whole<00:01:12.190> branch<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.760> want<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:12.970> bring<00:01:13.090> it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
that whole branch you want to bring it

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.370 
that whole branch you want to bring it
down<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.300> pieces<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.810> can<00:01:13.930> cut<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.110> right<00:01:14.230> now

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
down in pieces you can cut it right now

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.920 
down in pieces you can cut it right now
you're<00:01:14.530> gonna<00:01:14.620> bend<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.250> fence<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:16.780> can

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
you're gonna bend the fence but you can

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.720 
you're gonna bend the fence but you can
begin<00:01:17.170> taking<00:01:17.620> pieces<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.250> out<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.640> then

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
begin taking pieces of that out and then

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.850 
begin taking pieces of that out and then
print<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.000> out<00:01:19.090> at<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.300> base<00:01:19.510> here<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:20.020> see<00:01:20.620> in

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
print it out at the base here I see in

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.980 
print it out at the base here I see in
front<00:01:21.100> properly<00:01:21.610> as<00:01:21.790> I<00:01:22.090> look<00:01:22.360> at<00:01:22.480> this<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.780> see<00:01:22.810> a

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
front properly as I look at this I see a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.260 
front properly as I look at this I see a
hollow<00:01:23.290> spot<00:01:23.680> down<00:01:23.890> below<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:24.370> theory<00:01:24.760> is<00:01:24.970> that

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
hollow spot down below it theory is that

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.910 
hollow spot down below it theory is that
means<00:01:25.480> there<00:01:25.750> is<00:01:25.900> some<00:01:26.140> rot<00:01:26.350> probably<00:01:26.710> from<00:01:26.830> a

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
means there is some rot probably from a

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.350 
means there is some rot probably from a
pruning<00:01:27.220> cut<00:01:27.430> or<00:01:27.550> a<00:01:27.580> broken<00:01:27.910> branch<00:01:28.090> that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
pruning cut or a broken branch that

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.790 
pruning cut or a broken branch that
happened<00:01:28.630> earlier<00:01:28.990> cotton<00:01:29.410> with<00:01:29.560> our

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
happened earlier cotton with our

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.920 
happened earlier cotton with our
cottonwoods<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.640> willows<00:01:30.730> are<00:01:31.510> very<00:01:31.690> prone

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
cottonwoods and willows are very prone

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.810 
cottonwoods and willows are very prone
to<00:01:32.110> such<00:01:32.260> things<00:01:32.470> so<00:01:33.160> that<00:01:33.250> means<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:33.790> a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
to such things so that means this is a

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.640 
to such things so that means this is a
weak<00:01:34.030> branch<00:01:34.330> anyway<00:01:34.750> it's<00:01:35.140> probably<00:01:35.380> gonna

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
weak branch anyway it's probably gonna

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.530 
weak branch anyway it's probably gonna
split<00:01:35.980> out<00:01:36.160> in<00:01:36.340> some<00:01:36.610> wind<00:01:36.850> you're<00:01:37.120> lucky<00:01:37.420> the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
split out in some wind you're lucky the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.570 
split out in some wind you're lucky the
whole<00:01:37.570> thing<00:01:37.930> didn't<00:01:38.170> break<00:01:38.350> with<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.620> ice<00:01:38.740> so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
whole thing didn't break with the ice so

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.220 
whole thing didn't break with the ice so
it's<00:01:39.670> probably<00:01:39.880> wise<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.120> remove<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.960> whole

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
it's probably wise to remove this whole

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's probably wise to remove this whole
branch<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:42.250> gonna<00:01:42.430> remove<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.700> lot<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.850> your

branch it's gonna remove a lot of your

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.060 
branch it's gonna remove a lot of your
shade<00:01:43.270> but<00:01:44.080> it's<00:01:44.200> gonna<00:01:44.290> prevent<00:01:44.710> future

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070

shade but it's gonna prevent future
problems<00:01:45.400> right<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.930> want<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.140> prune<00:01:47.350> it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
problems right and you want to prune it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.470 
problems right and you want to prune it
properly<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.010> want<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.220> check<00:01:48.400> with<00:01:48.480> your

of this branch the time at the base
really<00:01:55.870> belongs<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.440> trunk<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.070> when<00:01:57.280> we

really belongs to the trunk and when we
prune<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.729> we<00:01:57.820> want<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.030> make<00:01:58.180> sure<00:01:58.210> we<00:01:58.479> don't

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
prune it we want to make sure we don't

prune it we want to make sure we don't
cut<00:01:58.990> into<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.470> tissues<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.340> belong<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.790> the

cut into the tissues that belong to the
trunk<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:02.229> now<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.830> are<00:02:02.860> looking<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:03.700> is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
trunk but now what we are looking for is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.860 
trunk but now what we are looking for is
to<00:02:04.270> get<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.750> rotten<00:02:05.500> hard<00:02:06.130> ass<00:02:06.370> under<00:02:06.940> also

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
to get the rotten hard ass under also

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.029 
to get the rotten hard ass under also
down<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:08.409> you're<00:02:08.560> not<00:02:08.649> gonna<00:02:08.739> be<00:02:08.859> able<00:02:08.979> to

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
down here you're not gonna be able to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.979 
down here you're not gonna be able to
remove<00:02:09.189> that<00:02:09.459> I'm<00:02:09.879> just<00:02:10.060> going<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:10.299> cut<00:02:10.959> that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
remove that I'm just going to cut that

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.959 
remove that I'm just going to cut that
so<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.439> branch<00:02:11.650> doesn't<00:02:11.889> break<00:02:12.219> because<00:02:12.459> of

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
so the branch doesn't break because of

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:13.559 
so the branch doesn't break because of
the<00:02:13.060> rot

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
the rot

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.179 
the rot
yeah<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.019> there<00:02:14.230> something<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.709> should<00:02:14.739> treat

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
yeah is there something I should treat

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.849 
yeah is there something I should treat
it<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.430> after<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.689> pray<00:02:17.049> me<00:02:17.110> good<00:02:17.500> question

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
it with after we pray me good question

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.530 
it with after we pray me good question
really<00:02:18.099> no<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.519> make<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> pruning<00:02:18.939> set<00:02:19.299> in<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
really no you make a pruning set in the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.170 
really no you make a pruning set in the
proper<00:02:19.840> place<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.519> treat<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:21.819> take<00:02:21.969> care<00:02:22.120> of

proper place the treat will take care of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
proper place the treat will take care of

this<00:02:30.430> tree<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.879> because<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.480> throwing<00:02:31.689> there

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
this tree is because it's throwing there

this tree is because it's throwing there

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
right there is on its last legs now you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.520 
right there is on its last legs now you
might<00:02:34.569> want<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.810> plant<00:02:35.049> another<00:02:35.260> tree

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
might want to plant another tree

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.069 
might want to plant another tree
somewhere<00:02:35.799> nearby<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:37.450> right<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.930> that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
somewhere nearby all right so that

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.750 
somewhere nearby all right so that
you've<00:02:38.230> got<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.379> new<00:02:38.590> tree<00:02:38.890> once<00:02:39.370> different

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you've got a new tree once different

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.729 
you've got a new tree once different
finally<00:02:40.030> does<00:02:40.209> go<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.450> because<00:02:41.379> you<00:02:41.530> need<00:02:41.650> a

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
finally does go out because you need a

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.429 
finally does go out because you need a
shape<00:02:41.950> right<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.969> will<00:02:43.260> eventually<00:02:44.260> go

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
shape right and it will eventually go

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.580 
shape right and it will eventually go
out<00:02:44.469> is<00:02:45.299> well<00:02:46.299> cottonwoods<00:02:46.900> willows<00:02:47.290> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
out is well cottonwoods willows and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
out is well cottonwoods willows and
things<00:02:48.220> like<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.519> tend<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.909> be<00:02:48.970> fairly

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
things like that tend to be fairly

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.390 
things like that tend to be fairly
short-lived<00:02:49.620> especially<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.829> area<00:02:51.099> and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
short-lived especially in this area and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.309 
short-lived especially in this area and
so<00:02:51.639> if<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.269> 30<00:02:52.510> or<00:02:52.659> 40<00:02:52.930> years<00:02:52.959> you're

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
so if you can get 30 or 40 years you're

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.379 
so if you can get 30 or 40 years you're
doing<00:02:53.530> really<00:02:53.680> good<00:02:53.980> some<00:02:54.909> don't<00:02:55.090> even<00:02:55.150> make

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
doing really good some don't even make

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.080 
doing really good some don't even make
it<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.629> long<00:02:55.810> right<00:02:56.669> okay<00:02:57.669> but<00:02:57.849> that's<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
it that long right okay but that's a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.399 
it that long right okay but that's a
good<00:02:58.239> question<00:02:58.629> I<00:02:58.780> see<00:02:58.959> you've<00:02:59.109> brought<00:02:59.230> us

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
good question I see you've brought us

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.420 
good question I see you've brought us
something<00:02:59.709> else<00:02:59.889> as<00:03:00.040> well

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
something else as well

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.030 
something else as well
yes<00:03:00.669> we<00:03:00.939> have<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.409> several<00:03:02.409> of<00:03:02.560> our<00:03:02.680> master

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
yes we have a several of our master

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250 
yes we have a several of our master
gardeners<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.629> them<00:03:04.750> brought<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
gardeners and one of them brought the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.099 
gardeners and one of them brought the
grapes<00:03:05.849> in<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.209> she's<00:03:07.419> trying<00:03:07.659> to<00:03:07.780> propagate

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
grapes in and she's trying to propagate

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.030 
grapes in and she's trying to propagate
them<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.510> she<00:03:10.510> had<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> minute<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.560> tell<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:11.919> to

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
them and she had a minute you tell it to

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.399 
them and she had a minute you tell it to
rain<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.459> got<00:03:12.669> fairly<00:03:13.090> cold<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:13.780> they<00:03:14.139> laced

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
rain that got fairly cold and they laced

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.250 
rain that got fairly cold and they laced
out<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.069> then<00:03:15.220> they<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.609> quit<00:03:16.019> okay<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.049> say

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
out and then they just quit okay I say

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.899 
out and then they just quit okay I say
some<00:03:17.500> problems<00:03:17.859> with<00:03:18.129> that<00:03:18.159> there's<00:03:18.459> luned

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
some problems with that there's luned

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.360 
some problems with that there's luned
over<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:19.590> that's<00:03:20.590> not<00:03:20.769> bad<00:03:20.979> that's<00:03:21.159> just

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
over here that's not bad that's just

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.490 
over here that's not bad that's just
whereas<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.729> bark<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.180> drying<00:03:22.479> up<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.989> big

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
whereas the bark is drying up the big

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.129 
whereas the bark is drying up the big
problem<00:03:23.919> on<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.280> one<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.669> the<00:03:24.940> cool<00:03:25.150> this

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
problem on this one is the cool this

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.379 
problem on this one is the cool this
wood<00:03:26.379> root<00:03:26.560> better<00:03:26.799> if<00:03:26.919> it<00:03:27.010> were<00:03:27.129> warmer<00:03:27.549> is

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
wood root better if it were warmer is

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.000 
wood root better if it were warmer is
there<00:03:28.629> a<00:03:28.659> certain<00:03:28.959> temperature<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:29.919> a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
there a certain temperature that's a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.349 
there a certain temperature that's a
water<00:03:30.220> ought<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.579> be<00:03:30.699> you<00:03:30.940> want<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.150> keep<00:03:31.239> the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
water ought to be you want to keep the

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.740 
water ought to be you want to keep the
water<00:03:31.540> up<00:03:31.690> around<00:03:31.870> 70<00:03:32.349> degrees<00:03:32.379> or<00:03:32.889> so<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:34.269> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
water up around 70 degrees or so and the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.539 
water up around 70 degrees or so and the
air<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.199> be<00:03:35.319> cooler<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.739> fact<00:03:35.979> a<00:03:36.220> lot<00:03:36.459> of

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
air can be cooler in fact a lot of

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.069 
air can be cooler in fact a lot of
plants<00:03:36.819> propagate<00:03:37.389> better<00:03:37.629> if<00:03:37.810> they<00:03:37.930> have

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
plants propagate better if they have

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.689 
plants propagate better if they have
what's<00:03:38.260> called<00:03:38.290> bottom<00:03:38.769> heat<00:03:38.979> so<00:03:39.519> you're

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
what's called bottom heat so you're

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.250 
what's called bottom heat so you're
heating<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> soil<00:03:40.419> and<00:03:40.659> letting<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> top

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
heating the soil and letting the top

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.530 
heating the soil and letting the top
portion<00:03:41.560> be<00:03:41.829> cool<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.909> one<00:03:43.090> thing<00:03:43.239> I've<00:03:43.329> tried

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
portion be cool and one thing I've tried

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.990 
portion be cool and one thing I've tried
in<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.690> past<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.560> put<00:03:44.889> an<00:03:45.159> aquarium<00:03:45.790> heater

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
in the past is to put an aquarium heater

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.689 
in the past is to put an aquarium heater
right<00:03:46.479> inside<00:03:47.260> there<00:03:47.530> set<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.459> it's<00:03:48.609> just

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
right inside there set it so it's just

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.890 
right inside there set it so it's just
keeping<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.269> warm<00:03:49.479> up<00:03:49.569> put<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> thermometer

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
keeping that warm up put a thermometer

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.629 
keeping that warm up put a thermometer
in<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.440> make<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.829> too<00:03:50.949> hot<00:03:51.099> you'll<00:03:51.280> cook<00:03:51.430> them

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
in to make it too hot you'll cook them

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.330 
in to make it too hot you'll cook them
but<00:03:52.419> put<00:03:52.659> a<00:03:53.049> thermometer<00:03:53.409> in<00:03:53.739> set<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.129> Swiss

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
but put a thermometer in set it Swiss

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.149 
but put a thermometer in set it Swiss
taking<00:03:54.609> 70<00:03:54.970> 75<00:03:55.389> degrees<00:03:55.989> where<00:03:56.709> is<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.979> top

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
taking 70 75 degrees where is the top

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.159 
taking 70 75 degrees where is the top
school<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.359> should<00:03:58.540> increase<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
school and that should increase the

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.270 
school and that should increase the
chance<00:03:59.379> of<00:03:59.500> rooting<00:03:59.829> and<00:03:59.859> I've<00:03:59.979> seen<00:04:00.159> that

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
chance of rooting and I've seen that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.420 
chance of rooting and I've seen that
actually<00:04:00.609> work<00:04:00.849> with<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.810> begonia<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:03.189> would

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
actually work with the begonia it would

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.339 
actually work with the begonia it would
intrude<00:04:03.669> it<00:04:03.849> would<00:04:04.000> intrude<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.049> put<00:04:05.229> the

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
intrude it would intrude and you put the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.839 
intrude it would intrude and you put the
aquarium<00:04:05.560> here<00:04:05.859> in<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.370> grew<00:04:06.549> roots<00:04:06.790> very

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
aquarium here in and it grew roots very

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.449 
aquarium here in and it grew roots very
quickly<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.590> that's<00:04:08.919> something<00:04:09.129> it<00:04:09.340> might

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
quickly so that's something it might

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.249 
quickly so that's something it might
work<00:04:09.669> to<00:04:09.849> help<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.419> of<00:04:10.840> course<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.109> can

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
work to help you and of course you can

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.679 
work to help you and of course you can
also<00:04:11.409> stick<00:04:11.769> them<00:04:11.889> in<00:04:11.979> soil<00:04:12.250> now<00:04:12.729> Curtis<00:04:13.150> on<00:04:13.329> in

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
also stick them in soil now Curtis on in

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.490 
also stick them in soil now Curtis on in
a<00:04:13.780> situation<00:04:14.349> like<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.680> if<00:04:15.009> it<00:04:15.189> was<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.729> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
a situation like this if it was in a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.469 
a situation like this if it was in a
house<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:18.099> just<00:04:18.370> at<00:04:18.549> room<00:04:18.729> temperature

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
house and it just at room temperature

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.569 
house and it just at room temperature
what<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.169> raised<00:04:20.560> depends<00:04:21.130> on<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.310> your<00:04:21.430> room

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
what it raised depends on what your room

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.550 
what it raised depends on what your room
temperature<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.450> with<00:04:22.659> cost<00:04:23.139> of<00:04:23.349> gas

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
temperature is and with cost of gas

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.019 
temperature is and with cost of gas
these<00:04:23.889> days<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.159> lot<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.400> people<00:04:24.639> are<00:04:24.729> cooling

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:25.029 
these days a lot of people are cooling

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.680 
these days a lot of people are cooling
their<00:04:25.150> house

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
their house

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.860 
their house
and<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:26.140> causing<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.620> problem<00:04:27.510> if<00:04:28.510> you're

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
and that's causing a problem if you're

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.500 
and that's causing a problem if you're
keeping<00:04:29.170> your<00:04:29.260> house<00:04:29.410> up<00:04:29.740> around<00:04:30.040> 80<00:04:30.280> degrees

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
keeping your house up around 80 degrees

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.340 
keeping your house up around 80 degrees
70<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.600> 80<00:04:31.780> degrees

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
70 to 80 degrees

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.740 
70 to 80 degrees
it'll<00:04:33.100> probably<00:04:33.190> route<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.520> lot<00:04:33.640> better<00:04:33.880> but<00:04:34.630> in

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
it'll probably route a lot better but in

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.360 
it'll probably route a lot better but in
a<00:04:34.810> place<00:04:34.930> where<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.260> does<00:04:35.410> cool<00:04:35.620> off<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:36.040> lot<00:04:36.280> of

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370

and what about lighting light is

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.210 
and what about lighting light is
important<00:04:58.720> once<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.110> leaves<00:04:59.290> appear<00:04:59.650> until

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
important once the leaves appear until

important once the leaves appear until
the<00:05:00.370> leaves<00:05:00.550> appear<00:05:00.970> you're<00:05:01.210> okay<00:05:01.860> when<00:05:02.860> the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
the leaves appear you're okay when the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.440 
the leaves appear you're okay when the
leaves<00:05:03.130> come<00:05:03.400> out<00:05:03.550> then<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.880> need<00:05:04.030> light<00:05:04.210> now

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
leaves come out then you need light now

leaves come out then you need light now
having<00:05:05.140> leaves<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.650> not<00:05:05.800> bad<00:05:06.600> because<00:05:07.600> you

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
having leaves is not bad because you

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.150 
having leaves is not bad because you
still<00:05:07.900> got<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.140> water<00:05:08.320> as<00:05:08.560> long<00:05:08.620> as<00:05:09.010> it's

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
still got the water as long as it's

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.740 
still got the water as long as it's
drawing<00:05:09.400> water<00:05:09.640> if<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:09.880> see<00:05:10.030> these<00:05:10.150> are<00:05:10.360> wilting

and<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.110> looks<00:05:11.260> like<00:05:11.380> there's<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> little

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
and it looks like there's a little

powdery mildew developing on it but the

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.860 
powdery mildew developing on it but the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
leaves will create sugars which will

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.840 
leaves will create sugars which will
translocate<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.920> bottom<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.370> feed<00:05:18.610> the

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.310 
stems that if the leaves don't appear
you<00:05:25.150> can<00:05:25.300> still<00:05:25.510> grow<00:05:25.630> roots<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.170> then<00:05:26.260> the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
you can still grow roots and then the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.950 
you can still grow roots and then the
leaves<00:05:26.500> will<00:05:26.680> come<00:05:26.710> out<00:05:26.890> afterwards<00:05:27.960> powdery

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960
