leather
that<00:00:42.329> has<00:00:42.510> got<00:00:42.719> softer<00:00:43.260> since<00:00:43.530> I've<00:00:43.680> had<00:00:43.860> it

and as you can see it's this sort of I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
and as you can see it's this sort of I
don't<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.390> how<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> describe<00:00:48.930> either

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
don't really know how to describe either

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.389 
don't really know how to describe either
but<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.100> up-close<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
but that is an up-close look at it and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
but that is an up-close look at it and
it's<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> silver<00:00:54.360> hardware<00:00:54.989> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
there is no zip along the main part of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.440 
there is no zip along the main part of
the<00:01:49.710> bag<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.549> sort<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> like

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.130 

it's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.659> popper<00:01:55.500> thing<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.780> yeah<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> sort

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it's a popper thing and yeah it sort

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.429 
it's a popper thing and yeah it sort
palletized<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:59.280> well<00:01:59.689> then<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.020> like

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
palletized as well then you have like

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.639 
palletized as well then you have like
three<00:02:01.740> compartments<00:02:02.430> inside<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:03.439> believe<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
three compartments inside I believe that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
three compartments inside I believe that
the<00:02:04.740> new<00:02:04.920> Hamiltons<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the new Hamiltons don't have the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
the new Hamiltons don't have the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
these at first I thought that these

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.120 
these at first I thought that these
straps<00:03:31.959> wouldn't<00:03:32.230> like<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.100> just

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
straps wouldn't like that but you just

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.020 
straps wouldn't like that but you just
have<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.519> sort<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.030> bend<00:03:34.780> them<00:03:34.989> up<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.500> down

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
have to sort of bend them up and down

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.420 
have to sort of bend them up and down
and<00:03:37.030> then<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.329> all<00:03:37.450> fly<00:03:37.630> straight<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.769> yes

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
and then it's all fly straight so yes

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.520 
and then it's all fly straight so yes
another<00:03:40.180> little<00:03:40.510> bit<00:03:40.630> of<00:03:40.720> detail<00:03:41.109> in<00:03:41.290> which<00:03:41.410> I
