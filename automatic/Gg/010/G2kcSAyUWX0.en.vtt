00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:02.116
 A long time ago, in a very, very distant galaxy ... 

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:08.250
 In the previous section 

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.641
 Prepare the front works. 

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.214
 In 5 minutes we start the final attack on the rebels. 

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:20.329
 Yes, my lord. Let the power be with us! 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.823
 Episode II: The Rebel Base 

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:31.404
 The Empire loses its strength, but it is one step away from the beginning of the final attack from its indestructible ship, the Death Star. 

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:38.201
 Meanwhile, on the planet Tatooine, the rebels manage to shorten the distance, and their leader prepares a heroic defense. 

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:43.395
 Ah, and you can be calm. Jar Jar Binks will not perform in this episode. 

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:52.074
 Win is impossible! The Empire's guns are too powerful! 

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.649
 Quecaaaa! 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.028
 Míster, have you seen Quece? 

00:00:56.513 --> 00:01:01.290
 Míster Jedi, those from the Death Star will attack us soon. What can we do? 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.843
 I've told you this many times, it's impossible, I do not know what tactics to use ... And what do you think? 

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.165
 Are you talking to me? 

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:15.502
 You can not hear anything with these cocoons on your ears. 

00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:17.332
 Yes, but it's nice to me, no? 

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:18.590
 Yes, of course. 

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.191
 Attention, they attack us! 

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:23.101
 Watch out, they're attacking us! 

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:30.245
 No, it's one of ours, always the same ... Disheartened or something? 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.370
 Wow, but now he throws this X-Wing with a new turbo! The speed of light reaches a fraction of a second. 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.570
 And what? When are we attacking the Death Star? 

00:01:42.923 --> 00:01:49.100
 Leave it, it's impossible. Maybe if we attacked very, very, very early ... 

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:54.040
 Ah! Who do I want to cheat? They are invincible! 

00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:58.480
 They are attacking us now! We can not do it! 

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.410
 We can not rest, we must fight míster. 

00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.970
 Only one person can help us. 

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.820
 Maybe he can help us ... 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.720
 You're right! Go look for him, he will give us a solution. 

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:17.020
 Come on, we're going to the ship. I have new subwoofers! 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.340
 And I have a record of Estopa, which they recorded in the interstellar cafeteria! 

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:22.780
 Friends! 

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:24.090
 Let the force be with you! 

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:25.800
 Thank you, míster! 

00:02:26.582 --> 00:02:29.110
 Let the night be in the pitcher? You're talking bullshit! 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.520
 Help me shoot those dulls! 

00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:37.040
 In the next episode ... 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.630
 For the lean way of getting to know is ... 

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:41.580
 Jump on one leg. 

00:02:46.744 --> 00:02:48.430
 Golden robot pat. 

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.210
 How do you feel? 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.890
 Already? I'm a Jedi Master? 

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.690
 No, I wanted to laugh. Baaaah! 

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.080
 To be continued
