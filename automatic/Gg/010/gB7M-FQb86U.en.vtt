00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.320
 4 mm caliber revolver 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:32.730
 chambered for Flaubert 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:35.460
 guys this is a Turkish company stalker like 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 you see is called the r1 modification 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.660
 model 4 by 9 guys means that in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.610
 drum 9 rounds for 4 millimeters and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.579
 four and a half inches is the length 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 the trunk 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.840
 company as well as arms company ltd 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:01.079
 produces this weapon guys so here 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.110
 the gun looks pretty impressive 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.689
 heavy thing in your hand is very cool 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.610
 and I feel a lot of steel 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.840
 plastic parts plastic hammers 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.689
 is there anything else 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 everything else everything is truly everything 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.460
 as an adult 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:28.340
 guys gun seriously and here it is though 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.340
 relate to pneumatics probably yes but 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 powerful enough guys to inflict 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 damage you can cock chickens for 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.689
 more accurate sighting shots here 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.600
 you can shoot that is simply by pressing on 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.909
 the trigger so there is one button no 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.820
 fuse but at least i don't 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:00.899
 found it button pulls out the drum for 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 charging well and all the other buttons on 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.240
 no gun plastic handle guys 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.179
 Well, such a small minus 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.940
 as for me, well remake on wooden 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.770
 it will be generally gorgeous thing she and so 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.099
 principle very cool looks very 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.900
 cool in the hand but if finalized 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.870
 it will be generally gorgeous here emblems on 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.650
 stalker on her inscription and immediately show 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.140
 everything 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:34.190
 shaved everything is fine and the number is 4 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.800
 millimeter caliber and 4 slept inches length 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 the trunk there is also two and a half 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.410
 small such version is in length and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.130
 as far as I know there are many different 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.330
 modifications gun quite powerful guys 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.840
 170 meters per second at the exit became here 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.370
 be careful please punch jackets 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.709
 punches plastic bottles beats 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.540
 Naturally glass is very cool 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.660
 tried on bottles out 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.849
 from under the champagne beer in general in the chips 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.930
 blown that is weapon enough 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.450
 powerful unlike pneumatics guys 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.609
 produces cotton on when shot at 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.840
 since ammo show ammo 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.340
 maybe not these bullets here 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.230
 at least 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.359
 type one guys inside gunpowder and primer 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.130
 and overall it's like a little patron 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.310
 small but real patron instead 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.329
 bullets and here's a ball on top 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.480
 pressed into its hallmark 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.989
 guys are expensive cartridges therefore 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.790
 think again the price of this 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.639
 patron somewhere 20 cents i.e. 20 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.510
 cents you on shot then like osb 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:07.769
 balls on the subject of ordinary balls 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:10.100
 guys here so that's where some 50 pieces for 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.200
 the same money you can shoot 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.350
 i.e. one shot or 50 shots 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.610
 despite the fact that the weapon is approximately 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:22.810
 same price here of this gun somewhere 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:26.740
 100 120 dollars well, plus or minus 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.320
 Naturally the cheaper eye go 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.690
 so think before you do 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.530
 purchase naturally you get great 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.420
 power but again you will shoot less often 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:45.170
 if your pocket is all right he 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.840
 Cheerful and full of something in himself 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.900
 refuse children have fun and all 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.370
 the rest I propose to reflect on 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 purchase because it is not very cheap 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.900
 shoot this gun guys 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.240
 cleaning lubricants in principle 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.730
 but there are special greases and special 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:13.120
 some in general i'm not a gunsmith 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.120
 I'll tell you in this here so it charges and 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.140
 naturally you can baht shoot i don't 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.260
 gonna be guys because it's loud and not 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.450
 I want to damage something in the house 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.730
 discharge occurs as follows 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:31.420
 click here on this thing well here here 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:35.000
 there is such a piece I will do it like this 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.790
 to be seen when it fits here 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.590
 such a thing and pulls cartridge with 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.530
 a drum like that you need to discharge it 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.360
 I don't know guys about fast charging 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:53.380
 Perhaps there is such know as in countries 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.380
 the thing that comes in here 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.880
 is so you with the extra 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.470
 ammunition mnu so there are no guys 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.930
 briefly again the main 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.670
 characteristics of 4 millimeter measles was 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.590
 caliber 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:12.740
 initial bullet speed of 170 meters 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:15.770
 second steel smooth barrel in this 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.449
 pieces u not on different smoothbore but 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.659
 very durable very cool good 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:25.289
 the material that is, I saw a few guns 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:29.219
 and here you can see that more or less excellent 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:33.210
 steel is good good good 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:38.300
 qualities that is, but gunsmith is not a toy 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.279
 and the weapon is like the total length of guys 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.620
 225 millimeters 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:46.439
 roughly speaking drum capacity 9 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.349
 drum material is steel i.e. 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:52.550
 the rest is all type of sight sighting 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:52.550
 plank and front sight 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.270
 here's a double action platoon type and 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:02.580
 plastic handle that's such a toy 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.569
 be with her neat guys very 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.539
 powerful thing all punches well and 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:13.349
 clothes and bottles and everything else so 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:17.659
 do not hurt anyone, use only 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:20.490
 for target shooting I do not advise 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:23.310
 engage in this thing since 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:29.159
 can piss them off 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:32.159
 rival and ogresti by almost healthy 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.919
 itypu sheng qi she is not for this this 

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.729
 more shooting such weapon for 

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:39.149
