the edge here you're gonna go down and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.219 
the edge here you're gonna go down and
make<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.280> few<00:01:15.640> loops<00:01:15.939> like<00:01:16.270> six<00:01:16.540> or<00:01:16.689> seven<00:01:16.720> loops

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
make a few loops like six or seven loops

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.730 
make a few loops like six or seven loops
so<00:01:17.470> I'm<00:01:17.560> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.740> go<00:01:17.920> one<00:01:18.220> two<00:01:18.909> three<00:01:19.740> four

five<00:01:21.520> how<00:01:21.850> about<00:01:22.000> five<00:01:22.240> loops<00:01:22.890> because<00:01:23.890> she

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
five how about five loops because she

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.139 
five how about five loops because she
has<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> little<00:01:24.640> bit<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.759> smaller<00:01:25.270> face<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.850> then

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the head of the bird is gonna go right

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.750 
the head of the bird is gonna go right
in<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> middle<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.040> she's<00:02:03.250> gonna<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:03.610> looking

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
that way so we want to make like a half

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.250 
that way so we want to make like a half
circle<00:02:06.040> here<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.810> her<00:02:07.930> head<00:02:08.170> will<00:02:08.350> be<00:02:08.760> and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
circle here where her head will be and

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
circle here where her head will be and
she's<00:02:11.260> gonna<00:02:11.500> be<00:02:11.950> coming<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:12.550> down<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
she's gonna be coming over down on the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.260 
she's gonna be coming over down on the
edge<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.960> nose<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.400> bring<00:02:15.700> up<00:02:15.970> from

edge of the nose so you bring up from

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.020 
edge of the nose so you bring up from
the<00:02:16.450> bottom<00:02:16.780> there<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.310> again<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
the bottom there and again just like the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.450 
the bottom there and again just like the
other<00:02:19.180> side<00:02:19.450> you're<00:02:19.630> gonna<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:20.050> about<00:02:20.290> five<00:02:20.590> or

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
other side you're gonna do about five or

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.640 
other side you're gonna do about five or
six<00:02:22.240> little<00:02:22.720> little<00:02:23.680> loops<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.400> two<00:02:24.790> three

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
six little little loops one two three

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.140 
six little little loops one two three
four<00:02:26.680> how<00:02:26.950> about<00:02:27.100> well<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.640> guess<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.090> only

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
four how about well I guess I can only

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.430 
four how about well I guess I can only
do<00:02:28.390> four<00:02:30.450> four<00:02:31.450> or<00:02:31.600> five<00:02:31.810> little<00:02:32.200> loops<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
do four four or five little loops and
