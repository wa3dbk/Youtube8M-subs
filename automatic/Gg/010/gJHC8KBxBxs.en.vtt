that to have a different variety on come
right<00:01:38.360> up<00:01:38.510> lame<00:01:39.400> so<00:01:40.400> it's<00:01:41.300> very<00:01:41.570> secure<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.380> like

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
right up lame so it's very secure I like

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.200 
right up lame so it's very secure I like
the<00:01:42.980> detail<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:45.380> tip<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.730> blade<00:01:46.820> is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the detail and the tip of the blade is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.710 
the detail and the tip of the blade is
flexible<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.830> can<00:01:49.100> actually<00:01:49.790> bend<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.360> as

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
flexible so I can actually bend it as

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.470 
flexible so I can actually bend it as
far<00:01:50.990> as<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.170> goes<00:01:51.590> back<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.370> just<00:01:52.850> reading<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
far as that goes back in just reading it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.110 
far as that goes back in just reading it
straighten<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.080> out<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:55.370> comes<00:01:55.580> back<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:56.000> the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
straighten that out it comes back to the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.840 
straighten that out it comes back to the
old<00:01:56.300> shape<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.620> that's<00:01:58.010> it

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
old shape so that's it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.070 
old shape so that's it
he<00:01:59.840> has<00:02:00.400> three<00:02:01.400> extra<00:02:01.670> hands<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.720> holding

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
hand actually it's not the holding hand

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.890 
hand actually it's not the holding hand
it's<00:02:10.729> an<00:02:10.879> open<00:02:11.209> hand<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:13.269> use<00:02:14.269> that<00:02:14.540> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
it's an open hand so we can use that to

it's an open hand so we can use that to
pose<00:02:15.500> him<00:02:15.769> with<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.730> blade<00:02:16.970> rouser<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.569> like

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
pose him with the blade rouser it's like

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.130 
pose him with the blade rouser it's like
having<00:02:18.769> him<00:02:18.920> hold<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> cards<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.930> fanned

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
out cards on a big brows

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.580 
out cards on a big brows
so<00:02:24.340> that's<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.510> let's<00:02:25.840> move<00:02:25.990> on<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
so that's it so let's move on to the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.790 
so that's it so let's move on to the
figure<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.750> si<00:02:29.170> si<00:02:29.410> Katie<00:02:30.120> blade

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
figure so this is si si Katie blade

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.970 
figure so this is si si Katie blade
possible<00:02:32.800> let's<00:02:33.580> move<00:02:33.820> with<00:02:34.210> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
possible let's move with the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.520 
possible let's move with the
articulation<00:02:35.980> point<00:02:36.220> head<00:02:37.200> moves<00:02:38.200> up<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
articulation point head moves up and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.310 
articulation point head moves up and
down<00:02:38.740> left<00:02:39.460> right<00:02:40.620> arms<00:02:41.620> do<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> swiveling

that's<00:04:35.629> a<00:04:35.720> bad<00:04:36.229> sign<00:04:37.159> for<00:04:37.370> all<00:04:37.599> blade<00:04:38.599> blade

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
that's a bad sign for all blade blade
