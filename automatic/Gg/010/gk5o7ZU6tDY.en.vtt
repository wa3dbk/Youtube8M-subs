00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 last I loved this fight when I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 rival brings freedom to the gender of the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 pokemon x ey one of them clear a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.309
 throne is seen to be the leader in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.159
 let's say quite defensive what will 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.870
 well this coach and paralyzes him seems 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.909
 Bertara can dodge a blow but not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.530
 level is the element a put a shine 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.530
 who receives was attack type sinister 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.360

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.260

 mega hunting 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.080
 an evolution little used and I like 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.720
 m long but I also really like 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.790
 such as mega the cadam know towards 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.070
 traces will copy the skill and it 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.740
 eat our master's skill and 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.780
 mental to a dark and dark radio to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.610
 same as and berta magical shine cleaning 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.160
 Fairy type attack that is very effective 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.510
 against and beltrán will weaken it not wow 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.920
 is and has to have them back is so 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.350
 less well placed because mega the hunt 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.690

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.510

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.190

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.300

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.040
 cut down pokemon is allowed to take off 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.810

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.979

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.160
 take advantage of that change to put a dance 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.229
 dragon care that we arrived with a 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.440
 Aragonese very, very dangerous 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.050
 we see how it seems chroma sas2 useful the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.550
 earthquake is very effective because it is 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.280
 electric is very 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.290
 it just went up god is just 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.390
 revenge is just revenge of those two 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.120
 lying down that hits the opponent and sends 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.100
 cycle to house leaves being lines has to the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.110
 two cinemas of the triplets the other pokémon 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.360
 legendary pokémon x and logically 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.120
 one of them and uses the now fer and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.830
 and here and puts a waterfall up 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.930
 what kind of water you receive and you have 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.850
 30% to push back at such level to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.070
 forgive outsiders does not do it 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.160

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.290
 be outside you are already in tables and 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.490
 Now 2 is just avenging that level 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.770
 is that he has sent 2 because they are going to 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.540

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.640
 the crack of this pocket this coach 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.320
