00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.629
 calm down today's plant lecture 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.629
 you can tell him what her roots are 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 the best planting time before high hurdles October and November 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.109
 then the plants have enough time to grow up before the winter 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 but how can we still plant in March? 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.230
 Make sure that the sensitive roots only grow in the blazing sun 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.340
 come lie 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.240
 also want to print no freedom » 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.750
 and if we have a suitable location 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.510
 Volker Lück and airy he should be 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 so they avoid typical roses diseases Makau 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.530
 Before you start planting the roses should be at least five 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.260
 Store in a large water-filled bucket for hours 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.430
 with it grew and shoots can absorb as much water as possible 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.820
 Now they start clearly the hole seems to be of sufficient size 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.960
 so they do not have to push the roots in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.270
 40 cm in diameter should have it at least 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.520
 also the depth is crucial 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.510
 Schlocker single reason, flange is still frustrated the plant lighter 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.510
 already roots can and above all forms no waterlogging 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.730
 The finishing point should later be at least five inches below the 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 Earth surface lie 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.929
 bundle with something special roses lackluster 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.350
 make the route easier to start 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.960
 then they trim the roots with a clean blacklist 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.679
 Alleys scissors at 15 to 20 centimeters 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.149
 By doing so they promote the formation of root growth, they now set the rose 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.140
 on 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.570
 Do not mix the surrounding he with high quality pants 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.570
 This contains another office are important components 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.060
 and so they wanted a little bit of the plant so that the earth was too 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 well distributed between the roots 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.970
 now the old or the old one presses the earth firmly for a good connection of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 Put roots and soil on this 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.489
 besides, they can then have a called Transformer t so that comes 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.480
 Water they flow into it 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.700
 the rose benefits and not for itself in the surrounding area 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.369
 next to the Czech Republic could be a tight pants in the summer
