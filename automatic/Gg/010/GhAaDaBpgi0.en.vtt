been<00:03:36.790> better<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.120> guess<00:03:37.389> but<00:03:37.889> right<00:03:38.889> now<00:03:39.040> it'll

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
been better I guess but right now it'll

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.640 
been better I guess but right now it'll
work<00:03:39.780> as<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> can<00:03:40.959> see<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.139> get<00:03:41.290> both<00:03:41.439> valve

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
and all the other gauges like I'll put

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.820 
and all the other gauges like I'll put
the<00:05:35.120> tack<00:05:35.300> over<00:05:35.540> here<00:05:35.720> so<00:05:36.230> I<00:05:36.290> guess<00:05:36.470> that<00:05:36.740> you

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
the tack over here so I guess that you

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.880 
the tack over here so I guess that you
know<00:05:36.890> racecar<00:05:37.820> look<00:05:38.050> don't<00:05:39.050> ask<00:05:39.230> me<00:05:39.410> he<00:05:39.650> had<00:05:39.770> to

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
know racecar look don't ask me he had to

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.970 
know racecar look don't ask me he had to
have<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.070> big<00:05:40.220> one<00:05:41.080> but<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.290> runs<00:05:42.440> good<00:05:44.980> it's

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
have the big one but it runs good it's

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.650 
have the big one but it runs good it's

good that's getting all day here for it

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.210 
good that's getting all day here for it
in<00:05:58.840> my<00:05:58.960> process<00:05:59.230> of<00:05:59.530> driving<00:06:00.010> it<00:06:00.100> the

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
in my process of driving it the

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.560 
in my process of driving it the
transmission<00:06:00.760> starts<00:06:01.060> slipping

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
transmission starts slipping

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.510 
transmission starts slipping
doesn't<00:06:02.140> want<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.320> shift<00:06:02.500> from<00:06:02.620> prep<00:06:02.890> first<00:06:03.310> a

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
doesn't want to shift from prep first a

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:25.700 
doesn't want to shift from prep first a
second<00:06:03.940> really<00:06:04.060> well

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.909 

yeah<00:06:26.710> I<00:06:26.770> think<00:06:26.979> it'll<00:06:27.190> wake<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.550> dead<00:06:27.729> yeah

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.100 

so<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.729> plan<00:06:33.939> was<00:06:33.969> never<00:06:34.270> done<00:06:34.599> for<00:06:34.870> they<00:06:34.960> can

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
so the plan was never done for they can

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.600 
so the plan was never done for they can
take<00:06:35.319> up<00:06:35.469> -<00:06:35.680> cash<00:06:36.009> -<00:06:36.039> a<00:06:36.310> big<00:06:36.490> haunted<00:06:37.120> house

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
take up - cash - a big haunted house

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.730 
take up - cash - a big haunted house
that's<00:06:39.180> probably<00:06:39.480> not<00:06:39.600> gonna<00:06:39.750> happen<00:06:39.840> I<00:06:40.380> mean

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
that's probably not gonna happen I mean

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.270 
that's probably not gonna happen I mean
I<00:06:40.830> probably<00:06:40.950> make<00:06:41.250> it<00:06:41.370> there<00:06:41.580> but

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.460 

seems<00:06:45.090> like<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:45.330> warm<00:06:45.510> work<00:06:45.720> outdoors<00:06:45.930> that

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
seems like the warm work outdoors that

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.130 
seems like the warm work outdoors that
slept<00:06:46.970> at<00:06:47.970> least<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.300> would<00:06:48.390> you<00:06:48.750> know<00:06:48.840> shift

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
slept at least it would you know shift

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.180 
slept at least it would you know shift
bad<00:06:49.910> after<00:06:50.910> that<00:06:51.060> I<00:06:51.090> would<00:06:51.240> shift<00:06:51.420> okay<00:06:51.750> so<00:06:51.810> uh

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
bad after that I would shift okay so uh

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.170 
bad after that I would shift okay so uh
being<00:06:53.190> a<00:06:53.280> 700r4

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
being a 700r4

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.910 
being a 700r4
and<00:06:54.480> it's<00:06:54.660> an<00:06:54.780> 82<00:06:55.020> and<00:06:55.470> I'm<00:06:55.530> sure<00:06:55.680> it's<00:06:55.830> the

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
and it's an 82 and I'm sure it's the

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.490 
and it's an 82 and I'm sure it's the
original<00:06:56.070> trainee<00:06:56.840> cast<00:06:57.840> praise<00:06:58.110> it<00:06:58.290> made<00:06:58.380> it

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
original trainee cast praise it made it

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.790 
original trainee cast praise it made it
that<00:06:58.650> far<00:06:59.870> so<00:07:00.870> I'll<00:07:01.050> be<00:07:01.200> the<00:07:01.260> next<00:07:01.380> adventure

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
that far so I'll be the next adventure

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.440 
that far so I'll be the next adventure
but<00:07:02.190> I'm<00:07:02.280> guessing<00:07:02.550> that'll<00:07:02.910> be<00:07:02.970> next<00:07:03.120> year

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
but I'm guessing that'll be next year

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.630 
but I'm guessing that'll be next year
the<00:07:04.290> budgets<00:07:04.680> gonna<00:07:04.830> used<00:07:05.100> up<00:07:05.280> for<00:07:05.430> what<00:07:05.520> we

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
the budgets gonna used up for what we

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.920 
the budgets gonna used up for what we
were<00:07:05.760> allotted<00:07:06.300> to<00:07:06.540> use<00:07:07.400> so<00:07:08.720> it's<00:07:09.720> still

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
were allotted to use so it's still

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.480 
were allotted to use so it's still
movable<00:07:10.350> still<00:07:10.530> drivable<00:07:10.980> he<00:07:11.100> can<00:07:11.220> use<00:07:11.340> it

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
movable still drivable he can use it

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.700 
movable still drivable he can use it
through<00:07:11.610> the<00:07:11.700> season<00:07:12.060> here<00:07:12.300> may<00:07:13.080> call<00:07:13.260> haunted

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
through the season here may call haunted

but<00:07:17.730> that<00:07:17.940> is<00:07:18.120> that<00:07:18.330> oh<00:07:19.880> I'm<00:07:20.880> sure<00:07:21.090> we'll<00:07:21.240> be

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
but that is that oh I'm sure we'll be

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.970 
but that is that oh I'm sure we'll be
seeing<00:07:21.360> more<00:07:21.720> of<00:07:21.780> this<00:07:22.020> this<00:07:22.410> project<00:07:22.860> will

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:22.980 
seeing more of this this project will

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.430 
seeing more of this this project will
never<00:07:23.100> be<00:07:23.250> done<00:07:23.340> for<00:07:23.580> a<00:07:23.610> while<00:07:23.670> I<00:07:24.200> think<00:07:25.200> I<00:07:25.260> put

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
never be done for a while I think I put

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.760 
never be done for a while I think I put
the<00:07:25.530> new<00:07:25.620> tires<00:07:25.830> on<00:07:26.100> yep<00:07:26.930> you<00:07:27.930> do<00:07:28.140> that<00:07:28.290> today

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
the new tires on yep you do that today

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.170 
the new tires on yep you do that today
I<00:07:28.800> think<00:07:29.010> I<00:07:29.070> fixed<00:07:29.340> the<00:07:29.430> window<00:07:29.610> regulator<00:07:29.850> in

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
I think I fixed the window regulator in

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.050 
I think I fixed the window regulator in
the<00:07:30.300> driver's<00:07:30.960> side<00:07:31.170> I<00:07:31.580> might<00:07:32.580> throw<00:07:32.730> a<00:07:32.820> video

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 
the driver's side I might throw a video

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.340 
the driver's side I might throw a video
of<00:07:33.150> that<00:07:33.300> but<00:07:34.010> that's<00:07:35.010> rat
