honestly don't hate any animals unless

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
honestly don't hate any animals unless
you<00:01:20.130> count<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.580> spider<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:21.390> animal<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:21.960> they

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
are arachnids so i probably don't hate

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.740

I was crying it hurts so bad and then
with<00:02:06.689> other<00:02:06.899> dogs<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.530> felt<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.399> were

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
with other dogs it felt like they were

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.119 
with other dogs it felt like they were
not<00:02:08.729> intelligent<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:10.530> cartoons

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
not intelligent because with cartoons

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.010 
not intelligent because with cartoons
they<00:02:11.489> always<00:02:11.879> portrayed<00:02:12.510> dog<00:02:12.840> at

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
they always portrayed dog at

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.700 
they always portrayed dog at

unintelligent ghost remember cat dog dog

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.890 
unintelligent ghost remember cat dog dog
was<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.160> cat<00:02:20.060> was<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.450> more<00:02:20.630> sophisticated

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
was not cat was the more sophisticated

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.310 
was not cat was the more sophisticated
one<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.950> dog<00:02:22.490> was<00:02:22.910> pretty<00:02:23.360> much<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.570> Dumber

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
one and dog was pretty much the Dumber

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.400 
one and dog was pretty much the Dumber
but<00:02:24.500> yet<00:02:24.740> go<00:02:25.040> lucky<00:02:25.490> happy<00:02:25.970> attitude<00:02:26.260> type<00:02:27.260> of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
but yet go lucky happy attitude type of

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.040 
but yet go lucky happy attitude type of
character<00:02:27.800> but<00:02:27.830> back<00:02:28.250> then<00:02:28.280> when<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.180> saw<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.600> I

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
character but back then when I saw it I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.570 
character but back then when I saw it I
just<00:02:30.170> figured<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.430> dogs<00:02:31.670> were<00:02:31.910> dumb<00:02:32.180> and

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
just figured that all dogs were dumb and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.530 
just figured that all dogs were dumb and
then<00:02:34.600> once<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.930> grew<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:37.130> realized<00:02:38.000> how

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
then once I grew up I realized how

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.390 
then once I grew up I realized how
important<00:02:39.050> dogs<00:02:39.260> weren't<00:02:39.530> how<00:02:39.740> intelligent

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
important dogs weren't how intelligent

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.940 
important dogs weren't how intelligent
