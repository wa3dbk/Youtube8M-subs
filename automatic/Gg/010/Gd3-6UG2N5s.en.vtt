00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
disabled people and the functions of the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.330 
disabled people and the functions of the
devices<00:00:16.970> people<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.420> diverse<00:00:18.949> some<00:00:19.949> people

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
devices people are diverse some people

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.029 
devices people are diverse some people
are<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.670> able<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.210> use<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> standard<00:00:22.039> devices

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
are not able to use the standard devices

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.200 
are not able to use the standard devices
that<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.750> everyday<00:00:25.230> life<00:00:25.380> and

that you or I use in everyday life and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
that you or I use in everyday life and
so<00:00:27.349> devices<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.619> been<00:00:28.859> specially<00:00:29.460> developed

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
so devices have been specially developed

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.260 
so devices have been specially developed
to<00:00:30.240> allow<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.869> these<00:00:31.050> differences<00:00:32.270> some

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to allow for these differences some

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.160 
to allow for these differences some
disabilities<00:00:34.170> mean<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.100> input<00:00:35.700> devices

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
disabilities mean that the input devices

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.630 
disabilities mean that the input devices
themselves<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:38.070> placed<00:00:38.370> at

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
themselves need to be placed at

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.860 
themselves need to be placed at
convenient<00:00:39.480> locations<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> person<00:00:41.010> for

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750 
example someone with physical problems
may<00:00:45.360> need<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.289> input<00:00:46.770> devices<00:00:47.190> close

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
may need to have the input devices close

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.049 
may need to have the input devices close
by<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.680> device<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.399> want<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> tell<00:00:50.850> you
