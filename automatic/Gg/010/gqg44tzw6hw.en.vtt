00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
wide this is and look at this

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.450 
wide this is and look at this
aftermarket<00:01:25.680> pinion<00:01:26.369> gear<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:28.460> half

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
aftermarket pinion gear and it's half

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210

this the thickness of that spur gear

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.929 
this the thickness of that spur gear
which<00:01:32.460> sucks<00:01:32.990> because<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.530> stripped<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
which sucks because I stripped a lot and

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.639 
which sucks because I stripped a lot and
it's<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.119> fun<00:01:39.299> replacing<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:40.369> riding<00:01:41.509> by

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.680 

you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.730> still<00:02:15.090> make<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> little<00:02:15.420> bit<00:02:15.600> of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
you can still make a little bit of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.510 
you can still make a little bit of
changes<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.710> feels<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.100> too<00:02:17.280> loose

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520

like<00:02:32.640> heavily<00:02:33.000> bash<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.540> firstly<00:02:34.530> do<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.860> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
like heavily bash it firstly do that so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.000 
like heavily bash it firstly do that so
comes<00:02:35.580> once<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> snow<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.740> like

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
comes once in the snow and if I like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.210 
comes once in the snow and if I like
punch<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.700> off<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.240> throttle<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.020> know<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.920> I

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
punch it off the throttle you know so I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.540 
punch it off the throttle you know so I
don't<00:02:42.030> go<00:02:42.900> slipping<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.830> sliding<00:02:44.220> everywhere

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
don't go slipping and sliding everywhere

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.550 
don't go slipping and sliding everywhere
like<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.600> know<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:45.990> get<00:02:46.110> more<00:02:46.260> control

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
like you know so I can get more control

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.640 
like you know so I can get more control
if<00:02:46.770> I'm<00:02:46.920> far<00:02:47.160> away<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.760> car<00:02:47.970> comes<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
if I'm far away and if a car comes the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.010 
if I'm far away and if a car comes the
slipper<00:02:49.980> clutch<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.490> spins<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
slipper clutch just spins and then I

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.410 
slipper clutch just spins and then I
don't<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.860> spin<00:02:53.460> around<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.820> circle's<00:02:54.210> and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
don't go spin around the circle's and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.870 
don't go spin around the circle's and
doing<00:02:54.780> donuts<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.200> stuff<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:56.160> kind<00:02:56.790> of

doing donuts and stuff that kind of

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:05.810 
doing donuts and stuff that kind of

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
in the way that I have my shocks is that

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.310 
in the way that I have my shocks is that
uh<00:05:14.630> excuse<00:05:15.630> me<00:05:15.840> mm<00:05:16.830> I'm<00:05:17.340> probably<00:05:17.789> gonna<00:05:17.970> blow

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
uh excuse me mm I'm probably gonna blow

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.850 
uh excuse me mm I'm probably gonna blow
like<00:05:19.320> make<00:05:19.770> me<00:05:20.009> go<00:05:21.020> pop<00:05:22.020> or<00:05:22.259> something<00:05:22.590> I<00:05:22.680> don't

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
like make me go pop or something I don't

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.480 
like make me go pop or something I don't
know<00:05:23.060> well<00:05:24.650> it's<00:05:25.650> because<00:05:25.889> I<00:05:25.919> doubled<00:05:26.400> up<00:05:26.430> the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
know well it's because I doubled up the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.100 
know well it's because I doubled up the
springs<00:05:26.909> so<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.570> know<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.780> doesn't<00:05:28.020> bother

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
springs so you know it doesn't bother

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.670 
springs so you know it doesn't bother
them<00:05:28.229> up<00:05:28.349> that<00:05:28.500> much<00:05:30.500> yeah<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:32.550> then<00:05:33.680> thank

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
them up that much yeah and then thank

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.050 
talking I'm gonna ask you guys you know
how<00:05:43.039> it<00:05:44.039> comes<00:05:44.340> with<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.580> power<00:05:44.759> cell

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
how it comes with the power cell

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.170 
how it comes with the power cell
batteries<00:05:45.479> in<00:05:45.599> their<00:05:46.009> 8.4<00:05:47.009> volts<00:05:47.669> right<00:05:47.880> I

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
batteries in their 8.4 volts right I

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.120 
batteries in their 8.4 volts right I
believe<00:05:49.020> so<00:05:49.770> well<00:05:50.490> his<00:05:51.479> voltage<00:05:51.930> meter<00:05:52.130> right

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
believe so well his voltage meter right

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.330 
believe so well his voltage meter right
here<00:05:53.990> says<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.590> it's<00:05:55.820> nine<00:05:58.130> point<00:05:59.130> seven

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
here says that it's nine point seven

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.469 
here says that it's nine point seven
five<00:05:59.610> this<00:06:00.120> fully<00:06:00.330> charged<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:02.330> when<00:06:03.330> I'm

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
five this fully charged and when I'm

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.360 
five this fully charged and when I'm
like<00:06:03.630> a<00:06:03.659> half<00:06:03.960> hour<00:06:04.169> through<00:06:04.620> like<00:06:05.009> seriously

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
like a half hour through like seriously

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.830 
like a half hour through like seriously
going<00:06:05.580> full<00:06:05.880> throttle<00:06:05.909> half<00:06:06.330> hour<00:06:06.509> through

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
going full throttle half hour through

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.020 
going full throttle half hour through
this<00:06:07.080> battery<00:06:07.469> must<00:06:07.650> be<00:06:07.740> retarded<00:06:08.099> and<00:06:08.400> it's

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
this battery must be retarded and it's

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.770 
this battery must be retarded and it's
amazing<00:06:09.509> retarded<00:06:10.639> because<00:06:11.639> I<00:06:11.909> check<00:06:12.539> it<00:06:12.659> with

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
amazing retarded because I check it with

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.719 
amazing retarded because I check it with
this<00:06:12.930> again<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:15.050> it<00:06:16.050> says<00:06:16.440> it's<00:06:17.190> at<00:06:19.280> 8.25<00:06:20.280> for

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
this again and it says it's at 8.25 for

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.149 
this again and it says it's at 8.25 for
I<00:06:20.759> believe<00:06:21.120> it<00:06:21.930> was<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.289> checked<00:06:22.770> it<00:06:22.889> when<00:06:23.009> it

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
I believe it was I checked it when it

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.450 
I believe it was I checked it when it
was<00:06:23.250> last<00:06:23.490> here<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.419> can<00:06:24.840> check<00:06:25.020> it<00:06:25.110> again<00:06:25.460> just

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
was last here I can check it again just

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.490 
was last here I can check it again just
just<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.060> show<00:06:27.210> you<00:06:27.300> guys<00:06:30.349> shouldn't<00:06:31.349> take

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
just to show you guys shouldn't take

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.600 
just to show you guys shouldn't take
that<00:06:31.620> long<00:06:31.680> to<00:06:32.310> do<00:06:32.430> it<00:06:32.460> kind<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.699> fast

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
that long to do it kind of fast

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:44.290 
that long to do it kind of fast
I<00:06:42.370> know<00:06:43.370> if<00:06:43.490> you<00:06:43.520> guys<00:06:43.669> could<00:06:43.909> see<00:06:43.969> that

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
I know if you guys could see that

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.950 
I know if you guys could see that
probably<00:06:44.629> not<00:06:44.900> but<00:06:45.860> yeah<00:06:46.550> right<00:06:46.759> right<00:06:47.750> there

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
eight point eight five that doesn't make

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.809 
eight point eight five that doesn't make
any<00:06:50.930> sense<00:06:51.139> at<00:06:51.319> all<00:06:51.409> and<00:06:51.650> I<00:06:52.580> haven't<00:06:52.729> even

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
any sense at all and I haven't even

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.510 
any sense at all and I haven't even
charged<00:06:53.270> it<00:06:53.419> for<00:06:53.689> a<00:06:53.750> long<00:06:53.900> time<00:06:56.379> I'll<00:06:57.379> even<00:06:57.620> get

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
charged it for a long time I'll even get

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.510 
charged it for a long time I'll even get
going<00:07:02.560> probably<00:07:03.560> gonna<00:07:03.740> sound<00:07:04.129> like<00:07:04.340> it's<00:07:04.460> a

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
going probably gonna sound like it's a

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.339 
going probably gonna sound like it's a
lot<00:07:04.639> way<00:07:05.000> faster<00:07:05.419> than<00:07:05.449> it<00:07:05.659> is<00:07:07.449> but<00:07:08.449> like<00:07:09.139> cuz

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
lot way faster than it is but like cuz

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:19.659 
lot way faster than it is but like cuz
it's<00:07:09.530> tires<00:07:09.889> off<00:07:10.129> but<00:07:17.710> ya<00:07:18.710> know<00:07:19.099> put<00:07:19.340> that<00:07:19.430> tire

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
it's tires off but ya know put that tire

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.270 
it's tires off but ya know put that tire
on<00:07:19.699> really<00:07:20.030> fast

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
on really fast

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.360 
on really fast
you<00:07:22.280> guys<00:07:22.430> can<00:07:23.349> see<00:07:24.349> what<00:07:24.590> this<00:07:25.039> baby<00:07:25.280> can

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
you guys can see what this baby can

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:34.990 
you guys can see what this baby can
actually<00:07:25.789> do<00:07:32.319> and<00:07:33.319> like<00:07:33.949> this<00:07:34.340> battery<00:07:34.789> dies

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 
actually do and like this battery dies

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.939 
actually do and like this battery dies
when<00:07:35.330> you<00:07:35.509> sound<00:07:35.750> that<00:07:35.960> low-voltage<00:07:36.349> that<00:07:36.770> I

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:36.949 
when you sound that low-voltage that I

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:47.890 
when you sound that low-voltage that I
think<00:07:37.310> that's<00:07:37.520> just<00:07:38.680> insane

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:47.900 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.500 

like<00:07:48.900> that<00:07:49.110> was<00:07:49.260> nothing<00:07:49.650> see<00:07:49.950> that<00:07:50.610> battery's

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510 
like that was nothing see that battery's

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.370 
like that was nothing see that battery's
dead<00:07:52.790> but<00:07:53.790> I<00:07:54.000> don't<00:07:54.750> know<00:07:54.810> if<00:07:54.900> it<00:07:55.020> can<00:07:55.230> be

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 
dead but I don't know if it can be

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.360 
dead but I don't know if it can be
depleted<00:07:55.740> or<00:07:56.010> something<00:07:56.340> I<00:07:56.550> don't<00:07:57.420> know<00:07:57.570> but
