the<00:00:35.950> smaller<00:00:36.280> pink<00:00:36.790> scallops<00:00:37.329> because<00:00:37.510> they

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
the smaller pink scallops because they

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.260 
the smaller pink scallops because they
have<00:00:37.750> a<00:00:37.780> lot<00:00:38.079> more<00:00:38.230> flavor<00:00:38.560> and<00:00:38.980> I<00:00:39.880> don't<00:00:40.180> know

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
have a lot more flavor and I don't know

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.700 
have a lot more flavor and I don't know
if<00:00:40.329> you<00:00:40.420> know<00:00:40.540> this<00:00:40.570> but<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:41.020> scallops<00:00:41.470> there's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
if you know this but on scallops there's

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.020 
if you know this but on scallops there's
always<00:00:41.890> like<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.040> little<00:00:42.370> lap<00:00:42.550> right<00:00:42.880> here

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
always like a little lap right here

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.550 
always like a little lap right here
which<00:00:43.149> is<00:00:43.300> actually<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.660> muscle<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.200> opens

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
which is actually the muscle that opens

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.960 
which is actually the muscle that opens
up<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.800> clams<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.399> you<00:00:45.460> really<00:00:45.700> want<00:00:45.880> to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
up the clams so you really want to

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.600 
up the clams so you really want to
remove<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.980> because<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.100> doesn't<00:00:48.370> do<00:00:48.460> us<00:00:48.489> any

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
remove that because it doesn't do us any

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.700 
remove that because it doesn't do us any
good<00:00:48.790> at<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.030> moment<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.989> like<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.470> take

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
good at this moment and I like to take

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.040 
good at this moment and I like to take
my<00:00:50.770> scallops<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.790> like<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.210> slice<00:00:52.720> them<00:00:52.899> in

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
my scallops and I like to slice them in

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.330 
my scallops and I like to slice them in
half<00:00:53.079> because<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.920> makes<00:00:54.040> it<00:00:54.190> look<00:00:54.309> like

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
half because it makes it look like

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.819 
half because it makes it look like
there's<00:00:54.460> more<00:00:54.760> protein<00:00:55.270> on<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.390> plate<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:56.680> we're

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
there's more protein on a plate so we're

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.150 
there's more protein on a plate so we're
going<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.010> take<00:00:57.160> our<00:00:57.219> scallops<00:01:02.040> now<00:01:03.040> we're

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
going to slice them half and then get my

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.639 
going to slice them half and then get my
stove<00:01:07.299> on<00:01:07.509> get<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.229> pan<00:01:08.499> searing<00:01:09.429> hot<00:01:10.649> so

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
stove on get that pan searing hot so

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.630 
stove on get that pan searing hot so
we're<00:01:11.799> going<00:01:11.920> to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
again is to make sure that you put the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.399 
again is to make sure that you put the

seasoning on the scallops now look at
that<00:01:24.500> looks<00:01:24.649> like<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.770> lot<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.009> protein<00:01:25.430> right

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
that looks like a lot of protein right
