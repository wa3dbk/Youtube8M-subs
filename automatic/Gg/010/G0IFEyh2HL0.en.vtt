 with him is going to you there. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.770
 highlighted with the game bids commander 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.400
 when that gaia was made by faltering 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.170
 it's military 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.240
 called openbox when you die you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.310

 65 stopped there when you die is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 even to the next video I'm there with a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.230
 text called penteie pec 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 I had seen her for a long time. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 it worked and such but I decided to test it 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 a texture that you build it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.830
 from the site you download from 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 little pin 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 other limone limone short life but if 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.950
 You can add as friend you want. 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.149
 cut bar you want me to find 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.640
 was really cool was that I left here 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 so if you want to test and download 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 the fine just its texture there you guys 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.480
 understand English what beauty will 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
 put him here then in our game 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.780
 let's call our command and let's go 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 expect more with tc is in stoles left 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.340
 take a look I think it's just click 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.170
 here small business here is also not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 I have no bug yes let's test the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.390
 guys, I clicked something that is is a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.030
 Spud spout false water down through 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 good news, let's theoretically test the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 people die now will have to set 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.010
 and pointing out is where the people 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 died I was doing a test that I 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 I'll take these things and leave them here. 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 get more for that diamond and let's go 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.070
 to test here or not 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.350
 neighborhood bridge before 20 mother near ne 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 Come and have a bar we'll see now. 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 they only work where you look 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.479
 rip the droid and now how do they work 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.400
 I'll just leave now click it with 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.110
 Let's see if this same one I got 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 without wanting a block that on the floor is not 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 so you have to break it here 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.500
 I clung far back the guys who only 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.149
 lives a vigorous together for some reason 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 quite strange 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.100
 I've been testing a thing to stop 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.850
 steal here what's good I lose the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.250
 good items and also the itu mother training 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.969
 but only break it back the item what it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 is important 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.170
 Yeah, but by chance, there's an anvil. 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.689
 let me take a look back is that only 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.280
 with this they invented the clean goal is only 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.340
 with a diamond sword galley 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.050
 goodness does not hit the captain 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.720
 let's see now make pee very good 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.590
 break that came to me then my sword 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.819
 is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 I think you can get an anvil 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.800
 In my hand, I think you've researched and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.959
 also this item more good start we 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.700
 even the little brother here never worked 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.480
 here is a face that we are going to think about 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.349
 again 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.900
 barrysson point here when a thump the 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.510
 Look, everyone is here in good shape. 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.950
 Only broken here so break the pick up 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 things back I want to test too 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.629
 as it is in the western survivor possible and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.700
 only slaps break even part 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.079
 that somehow round 0 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.310
 Let's see the guys I just broke the plate. 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.260
 break even JSO recovers plate 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.810
 your items are now this is the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.090
 command is gremista is very simple neighbor 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.670
 but it is a function that has a finalized 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.790
 open blocks is a very 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 useful indeed you like I guess 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.269
 which has much to say to be honest 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.879
 I found it very cool and fun. 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.680
 everything is in case you want to download is just 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.840
 vote block on show here so and so 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.549
 clicking on the install button is probably 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.450
 is because it also works in multiplayer 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.579
 I think after you need 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.110
 do is if this process is on time 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.910
 case and want the command just sit on the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.220
 sign up you need to link cute 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.019
 and also in texture between pec 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.000
 Look, the mute face has had a chance since 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.920
 moves me and I think the highlight of the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.470
 participation in the testimony is actually 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.019
 I sent there is also the texture of our 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.910
 explosion falls swap texture that you 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.590
 lose all your items each one thinks 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.900
 that I never tnt imagined what I liked 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.269
 Let's test that one of the stewardesses 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:46.079
 who stay that cow who protested ctt 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:47.900
 This explosion when you're beautiful. 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.160
 Now, what are you doing? 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.840
 neighbors to the consensus that this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.849
 question is to leave the PSDB command is 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
 that works the texture is worth it 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.790
 It's really cool, beauty, that's it 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.790
 galley thanks
