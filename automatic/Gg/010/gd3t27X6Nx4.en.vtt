another another spool that fits on there

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.069 
another another spool that fits on there
that's<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.209> one<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.450> i've<00:03:14.570> got<00:03:14.750> connected

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
that's the one that i've got connected

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.000 
that's the one that i've got connected
up<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:16.120> shop<00:03:17.120> press<00:03:17.600> at<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.170> moment<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.950> i

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
up to the shop press at the moment so i

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.720 
up to the shop press at the moment so i
not<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.250> shop<00:03:19.400> press<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.320> drill<00:03:21.320> press<00:03:21.730> at

the moment so this one simply you can
see<00:03:27.709> here<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.100> nut<00:03:28.310> welded<00:03:28.730> on<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:30.380> just

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
see here the nut welded on that just

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.880 
see here the nut welded on that just
goes<00:03:30.920> onto<00:03:31.750> there<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:34.280> connects<00:03:34.760> up<00:03:34.940> there

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
goes onto there it connects up there

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.810 
goes onto there it connects up there
connects<00:03:36.890> up<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.310> connection<00:03:37.609> that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
connects up to that connection that

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.180 
connects up to that connection that
connection<00:03:38.209> comes<00:03:38.390> out<00:03:38.890> connects<00:03:39.890> directly

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
connection comes out connects directly

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.670 
connection comes out connects directly
onto<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.730> one<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.450> by<00:03:41.630> side<00:03:41.900> screws<00:03:42.380> into<00:03:42.560> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
onto that one so by side screws into the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.830 
onto that one so by side screws into the
hole<00:03:42.950> there

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
hole there

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.140

it's<00:03:44.840> all<00:03:45.049> very<00:03:45.079> modular<00:03:45.640> quick<00:03:46.640> assembly

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
it's all very modular quick assembly

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.170 
it's all very modular quick assembly
