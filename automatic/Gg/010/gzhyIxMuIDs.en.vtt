 well in this video I will mention you 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.090
 some data that probably 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.270
 they did not know about batman 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.100
 so let's start with the information the 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.830
 true name of batman is bruce 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.990
 wayne and this superhero was created by 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.849
 bob kane and bill finger in May 1939 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.100
 the batman character was created 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.440
 based on three other very popular 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.830
 characters which are the fox 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.720
 dracula and shadow at a start the 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.180
 batman's story was developed in the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.489
 this new york city soon after 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.040

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.530
 fictional gothic city which in case 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.690
 that you ask is located 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.860
 according to the comic in the new state 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.200
 yersey in the USA would cost more than 300 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.350
 million dollars can be batman in 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.629

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.640
 science behind everything related to 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.530

 melbourne in australia was founded by 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.330
 a man by the name of john batman is for 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.820
 this reason that in this city you can

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.970
 of batman and even the batman park 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.400
 among many other crazy 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.920
 the original name of this city was 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.200
 batman already and his first official document 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.440
 it was called the batman treaty without 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.870
 doubt a very curious chance in a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.690
 limited edition series published by 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.120
 dc comics marvel batman and wolverine are 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.060
 combine in a single character called 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.700
 'from current a man called chris 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
 wheeler built his own batcave the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.350
 which cost him around 150 thousand 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.510
 dollars and more than 2 and a half years of 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.910
 I work building it in this one 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.610
 baticueva he has more than 2000 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.610
 comics a complete suit of batman e 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.920
 even your own secret entrance is 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.869
 well known that batman detests weapons 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.150
 fire as were these that 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.009
 They took the lives of their parents but 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.530
 in the first batman comics who 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.330
 used pistols but soon after his 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 creator decided not to implement them anymore 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.580
 because he considered that they were not going 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 according to the batman batman character is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.780
 probably the only superhero who 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.120
 could exist in real life though 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.980
 studies on the subject have shown that 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.090
 his life time would end a very old age 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.190
 early 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.860
 of the great physical demand imposed on your 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.810
 body these were some of the data 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.510
 more curious I could find out about 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.269
