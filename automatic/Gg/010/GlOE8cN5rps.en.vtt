 the human needs the building to live 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.780
 just as the building needs the human to transcend

 or the theater juÃ¡rez de guanajuato 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.920
 the splendor that these do not 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.880
 the buildings mostly did not come from the Mexican sugar mill 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 President look at France and the United States as models of modernity

 European architects as they emit to alternate without which they were brought 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.430
 to create the representative structures of the moment

 of the communications and public works secretariat 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.000
 there is discontent among the people 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.550
 It was 1904 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.810
 and extreme injustice throughout the country raised tension between the country 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:16.279
 imposing blocks of marble Italian granite Nordic bronzes asked the 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.569
 canterano gave shape to this spectacular building 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 which symbolized the division between classes 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.809
 this space is the museum 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.709
 and houses one of the most impressive art collections 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:27.659
 the Italian 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.819
 adamo boari 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.679
 franco student 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.679

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.499
 post palace 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.479
 taking inspiration from European palaces 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 the building shows the greatness of Elizabethan Gothic 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.079
 with its marble stairs 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.869
 bows and candlesticks 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.089
 the freight was for the group's uploads and lines 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.089
 in his chapter he joined cattle ranch 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.020
 right in front of the post palace 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.750
 the same adamo boari starts construction on what would become 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.649
 in the jewel of the time 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.439
 the national theater 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.439
 what is now known as the palace of fine arts 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.899
 It stands out for employing the latest technical advances and its day 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.319
 its construction dates already 32 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.599
 and said romanticism 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.329
 broken and indicated 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.919
 cultures from the dome to the stained glass floor 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.720
 the lic and on the stage itself hangs a unique work of art 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.270
 we are happy 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.320
 It is a gigantic 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.300
 a mosaic with the image of the country 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300
 police sources 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.800
 she knows it would be one of the many works she plays 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.199
 I would not think 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.199
 simply between 1910 and 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.080
 more than seven hundred buildings 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.759
 for the president the chords of his fake came to an abrupt end in 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.300
 1910 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.719
 when the people rose up in arms to dismiss him 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.729
 the following year the dictator resigned and went into exile in France 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.319
 the country that inspired the mexico that always wanted to create 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.319
 where he would die almost four years later 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.240
 for one hundrerd
