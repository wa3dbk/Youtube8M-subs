00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
now there's no real exact science to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.760 
now there's no real exact science to
this<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.360> can<00:01:28.540> use<00:01:28.570> three<00:01:29.020> toothpicks<00:01:29.560> you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
this you can use three toothpicks you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.750 
this you can use three toothpicks you
can<00:01:29.950> use<00:01:30.130> for<00:01:30.400> toothpicks<00:01:32.490> whatever<00:01:33.490> helps

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
can use for toothpicks whatever helps

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.180 
can use for toothpicks whatever helps
hold<00:01:34.180> your<00:01:34.480> avocado<00:01:34.990> pads<00:01:35.320> what<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:36.010> I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
hold your avocado pads what I do is I

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.420 
hold your avocado pads what I do is I
like<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.430> test<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:37.930> avocado<00:01:38.440> pit<00:01:38.770> make<00:01:39.220> sure

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
like to test my avocado pit make sure

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.160 
like to test my avocado pit make sure
that<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.940> toothpicks<00:01:40.480> are<00:01:40.630> going<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.870> support

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
that the toothpicks are going to support

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.340 
that the toothpicks are going to support
it<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.850> I'm<00:01:43.210> going<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.660> add<00:01:44.080> water<00:01:46.350> now

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
it then I'm going to add water now

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.040 
it then I'm going to add water now
utilizing<00:01:48.070> this<00:01:48.310> method<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.240> takes<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.810> pit

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
utilizing this method it takes the pit

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.760 
utilizing this method it takes the pit
longer<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:51.400> root<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.810> if<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.080> use<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.320> soil

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
longer to root then if you use the soil

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.430 
longer to root then if you use the soil
method<00:01:54.310> but<00:01:55.120> it's<00:01:55.330> just<00:01:55.540> fun<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.050> watch<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
method but it's just fun to watch the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.630 
method but it's just fun to watch the
roots<00:01:56.650> come<00:01:56.980> down<00:01:57.480> into<00:01:58.480> the<00:01:58.600> water<00:01:59.490> then<00:02:00.490> what

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
roots come down into the water then what

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.950 
roots come down into the water then what
you'll<00:02:00.820> need<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.000> do<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.330> you'll<00:02:01.450> need<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.780> take

you'll need to do is you'll need to take

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.380 
you'll need to do is you'll need to take
a<00:02:01.990> container<00:02:02.620> head<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.730> sunny<00:02:04.180> window
