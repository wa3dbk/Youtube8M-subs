00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
a little bit mediocre but basically what

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to that it's easy to use you paint over

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
to that it's easy to use you paint over
blocks<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.590> make<00:01:25.830> blocks<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> actually<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
blocks you make blocks and actually is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.100 
blocks you make blocks and actually is
really<00:01:26.790> easy<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> couple<00:01:27.630> cool<00:01:27.840> maps

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
really easy to make a couple cool maps

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
really easy to make a couple cool maps
and<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.740> could<00:01:28.890> totally<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.549> lot<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> awesome

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and I could totally see a lot of awesome

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.600 
and I could totally see a lot of awesome
maps<00:01:30.930> coming<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.400> though

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
maps coming out of this right now though

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.130 
maps coming out of this right now though
they<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.299> blocks<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.020> really

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
they just have blocks they don't really

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
they just have blocks they don't really
have<00:01:34.320> too<00:01:34.470> many<00:01:34.590> devices<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.790> minecraft<00:01:36.000> has

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
have too many devices now minecraft has

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
have too many devices now minecraft has
a<00:01:36.329> lot<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> devices<00:01:37.200> especially<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
a lot of devices especially with the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.200 
a lot of devices especially with the
different<00:01:38.159> pistons<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> could<00:01:39.119> do

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
different pistons and what you could do

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
different pistons and what you could do
with<00:01:39.240> redstone<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.439> minecraft<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> can

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
with redstone so on minecraft you can

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
with redstone so on minecraft you can
actually<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:42.630> things<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.259> do

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
actually make more things you can do

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
actually make more things you can do
more<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.240> creativity

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
more things and you know more creativity

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
more things and you know more creativity
there<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.380> game<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.979> blocks

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
there but in this game it's just blocks

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
there but in this game it's just blocks
so<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> basically<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.659> different

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so you basically can just make different

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
so you basically can just make different
terrain<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.159> can't<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.030> too<00:01:51.329> much

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
terrain you can't really do too much

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.760 
terrain you can't really do too much
with<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> different<00:01:52.079> devices<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
with the different devices like you can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
with the different devices like you can
in<00:01:52.799> say<00:01:53.159> halo<00:01:53.490> forge<00:01:53.850> where<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> lot

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
in say halo forge where you have a lot

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.179 
in say halo forge where you have a lot
of<00:01:55.049> different<00:01:55.409> devices<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.070> make

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
of different devices and you can make

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.679 
of different devices and you can make
lots<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.520> different<00:01:56.759> game<00:01:56.909> types<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
lots of different game types in this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.789 
lots of different game types in this
game<00:01:57.869> you're<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.290> sort<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> making

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
game you're just sort of making

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.080 
game you're just sort of making
different<00:01:58.950> maps<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.610> kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> look

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
different maps that kind of look

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.459 
different maps that kind of look
differently<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.719> they're<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.020> have

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
differently you know they're gonna have

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.749 
differently you know they're gonna have
a<00:02:01.500> different<00:02:01.770> game<00:02:01.950> flow<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.310> everything<00:02:02.640> but

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
a different game flow and everything but

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
a different game flow and everything but
you're<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.000> gonna<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.299> anything<00:02:03.570> crazy

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
like a vortex tunnel that sucks up

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.580 
like a vortex tunnel that sucks up
people<00:02:06.570> into<00:02:06.780> space<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.200> something<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.530> that

cool like that so sorry to say that if
they<00:02:11.340> add<00:02:11.520> more<00:02:11.790> devices<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.300> course<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> game

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
they add more devices of course the game

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.640 
they add more devices of course the game
is<00:02:12.870> still<00:02:12.930> new<00:02:13.230> if

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
is still new if

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.319 
is still new if
add<00:02:13.769> more<00:02:13.950> devices<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> more<00:02:14.730> device<00:02:14.970> blocks

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
add more devices and more device blocks

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.360 
add more devices and more device blocks
or<00:02:15.659> activation<00:02:16.170> blocks<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:17.099> that'd<00:02:17.250> be

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
or activation blocks then that'd be

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.619 
or activation blocks then that'd be
really<00:02:17.519> awesome<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.970> could<00:02:18.209> totally<00:02:18.299> see<00:02:18.599> it

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
really awesome I could totally see it

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.449 
really awesome I could totally see it
totally<00:02:18.959> possible<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:20.099> game<00:02:20.310> would<00:02:20.400> be

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
totally possible and this game would be

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.399 
totally possible and this game would be
infinitely<00:02:20.970> better<00:02:21.360> however<00:02:21.870> right<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.200> as

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
infinitely better however right now as

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.050 
infinitely better however right now as
it<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:22.920> pretty<00:02:23.099> okay<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.700> had<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> lot

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it is it's pretty okay and I had a lot

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.759 
it is it's pretty okay and I had a lot
of<00:02:24.090> fun<00:02:24.269> actually<00:02:24.480> playing<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:25.560> guns

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
of fun actually playing it so the guns

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.920 
of fun actually playing it so the guns
there<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.129> recoil<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.790> everything<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.900> a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
there is recoil and everything it is a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.630 
there is recoil and everything it is a
little<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.349> difficult<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:29.069> shoot<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.430> guess

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
little bit difficult to shoot I guess

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.550 
little bit difficult to shoot I guess
you<00:02:29.760> could<00:02:29.790> say<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.480> not<00:02:30.720> entirely<00:02:30.989> fun<00:02:31.379> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
you could say it's not entirely fun to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.569 
you could say it's not entirely fun to
run<00:02:31.650> around<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:32.099> this<00:02:32.220> game<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
run around in this game the

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.580 
run around in this game the
maneuverability<00:02:33.269> how<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> player<00:02:34.109> moves<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
maneuverability how the player moves and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.319 
maneuverability how the player moves and
everything<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.099> really<00:02:35.340> floaty<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:36.000> course<00:02:36.180> we

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
everything is really floaty of course we

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.509 
everything is really floaty of course we
expect<00:02:36.659> that<00:02:36.720> being<00:02:37.079> this<00:02:37.530> kind<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.829> game<00:02:38.010> but

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
expect that being this kind of game but

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.089 
expect that being this kind of game but
i<00:02:38.549> really<00:02:38.819> wanted<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.319> shift<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.470> run<00:02:40.709> or

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
i really wanted like a shift to run or

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.649 
i really wanted like a shift to run or
sprint<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.730> then<00:02:41.819> maybe<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> leaping

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
sprint and then maybe like a leaping

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.319 
sprint and then maybe like a leaping
jump<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.709> want<00:02:43.950> more<00:02:44.220> mobility<00:02:44.730> kind<00:02:45.239> of

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
jump I just I want more mobility kind of

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.240

like<00:02:45.450> titanfall<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.889> game<00:02:47.040> I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
like titanfall in this kind of game I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
like titanfall in this kind of game I
guess<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.670> too<00:02:47.790> much<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.970> ask<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
guess it's too much to ask for and it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.360 
guess it's too much to ask for and it
just<00:02:48.959> doesn't<00:02:49.500> feel<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.829> good<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
just doesn't feel that good so if the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.099 
just doesn't feel that good so if the
gameplay<00:02:50.760> itself<00:02:50.879> isn't<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.540> fun<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.900> don't

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
gameplay itself isn't that fun I don't

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.089 
gameplay itself isn't that fun I don't
see<00:02:52.230> why<00:02:52.260> people<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.620> spend<00:02:52.980> their<00:02:53.069> time

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
see why people would spend their time

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.740 
see why people would spend their time
creating<00:02:53.670> maps<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.150> everything<00:02:54.480> when

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
creating maps and everything when

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.550 
creating maps and everything when
they're<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:54.959> gonna<00:02:55.109> have<00:02:55.290> mediocre

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560

they're just gonna have mediocre
gameplay<00:02:55.889> and<00:02:56.190> that's<00:02:56.310> honestly<00:02:56.609> how<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.760> feel

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
gameplay and that's honestly how I feel

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.970 
gameplay and that's honestly how I feel

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
to be a little bit more polish and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.220 
to be a little bit more polish and
