00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.459
 within wageningen there are fraud scientists working on it 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.489
 various nutrition and healthy projects 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.429
 let's have one 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.429
 take a Dutch example 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.919
 wageningen ur and has various classification test fields 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.269
 waghmare test 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.460
 the potatoes that we already have for you are selected for all kinds of different 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.290
 research projects 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.810
 for example to starch production 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.470
 resistance to certain diseases 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.640
 or the amount of those residues of plant protection products and their effects 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.460
 for the health 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.480
 in our laboratories, researchers are involved in breeding 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.890
 horse poo customers 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.380
 for example, to develop post cards that contain more nutrients 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 wageningen has specialized in this year 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.030
 laboratories 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.800
 test passes 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.800
 and climate 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.000
 at the same time, our food technologists work around 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.320
 complaints from companies on government to the development of healthier products 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.060
 for example with less salt and fat or with a different composition of starch 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.880
 and then the time has come 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.290
 the potato ends up in the store as left 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.670
 or chips 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.320
 wageningen ur er wants to help consumers make a healthy choice 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.640
 our scientists therefore look at issues such as the effectiveness of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 health marks a presentation on the shelf 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.390
 but not only individual foods have our attention 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.530
 Wageningen food scientists are also looking at dietary patterns 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.720
 a panel of test persons is provided with for a certain period of time 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.140
 meals for example with the potatoes 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.340
 a health is closely monitored 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.440
 so investigate 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.510
 when the health effects of different diet 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.689
 and that was just the potato 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.309
 for more information about our research on nutrition and health 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.059
 you can go to this competition 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.639
 wageningen ur 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.829
 for coffee or body
