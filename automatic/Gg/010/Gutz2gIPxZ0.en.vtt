00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Welcome to cabin 82 64 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 yes, she is still virgin 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800
 so to speak the aidamar is not yet 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.960
 baptized and I want you the cabin 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080
 Let's start now 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 at the entrance is very important there 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 this is a push for the boarding pass 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.189
 and you can tell already yes if I the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 Take off the card , the light goes out 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.840
 So that's always a requirement 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.000
 i have light on the cabin here and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 we'll see so here they are 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.489
 A total of three doors are available 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.829
 disposal and very important there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 also the life jackets where it is yes 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 enough at the collection points 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.460
 life jackets exist as even if he does 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 which should not take 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.809
 is that in principle no problem 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.100
 There is also a safe here, of course 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.770
 free to use 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 Numerous subjects are here for storage 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 This cabin is for up to three 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.370
 people down here are once again 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.620
 additional covers if you have the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.930
 normal cover was not enough 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.790
 then it gets a bit more cuddly like that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.710
 Here you can hang up your hands 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 yes and that are also the ironing one completely 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.510
 comfortable it may decrease gives her yes 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.020
 which have up here then one 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.490
 securing mechanism so that the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
 not cloud that is a bit tedious 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 to thread that in, that's alright 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.500
 very detailed now weight to mirror 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.450
 we have room for one more time here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.590
 shirts of course I can do that here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.520
 Put the case in if I do not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.619
 under bed 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.189
 and here is another one 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.130
 lifebelt number three then we are 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.430
 here at the small desk it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.890
 gives with a simple chair and one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.649
 drawer is located in this drawer 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 the movie yes that is in there too 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.369
 So if I connected the now 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 I can easily fill up 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.899
 have phone of course this is a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.430
 expensive fun if you somehow land 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.130
 wanted to call that is very clear so 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.840
 that it is supposed to avoid two 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.030
 sockets we have if something 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.729
 wanted to recharge that's relative 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.770
 important and it is one of the two 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.649
 remote control for so-called iptv 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.540
 that's a relative 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.239
 lexus system what about e-readers now 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.950
 allows for example 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.709
 I can retrieve videos 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.409
 can look at where is precisely 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.939
 where are the others so 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.879
 if we look up here now 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.970
 is just everyone should be here number 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.930
 kara and here in hamburg we are now 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.480
 So I turn off the TV again 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.220
 we look more and more often here 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.269
 we have the two beds myself 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.950
 I was not in it 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.329
 Here we see that is already 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.579
 a bit of a disadvantage in this whole 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.730
 ships of the sphinx class so aidadiva 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.349
 and ford the following ones just have her here 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.569
 See it in my size comparison 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.220
 Hand a very small dessert 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.409
 I mean the advantage is you can there 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.510
 do not forget anything yes is also stupid 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.859
 but somehow there are so small everywhere 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.079
 has fan and so there is always that 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.579
 risk that we can forget something 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.189
 see here cabinet surface cupboard 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.139
 laundry closet area and of course 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.569
 yes, always criticized by some is good 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.730
 so expensive that water costs two euros 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.620
 Of course you do not have to do fifty 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.000
 because you can speak there as well 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.620
 nothing against quite normal that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.940
 drink tap water because that's it 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.549
 also drinking water so yes that is one 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.199
 Cabin for three people so there there 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.810
 it still loaded from all my luggage 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.599
 I fold this chair down the chambers 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.810
 've slept on it he found yes 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.159
 the only way less comfortable but well me 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.239
 my suitcase when it comes to children or 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.519
 something like that maybe not so 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.220
 is sensitive then that's for sure 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.159
 no problem and look here is the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.049
 balcony in this case two chairs the 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.459
 you can also adjust from 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.239
 angle of inclination here, of course we 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.970
 see 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.069
 The balcony is not really big 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.459
 then the table you see in 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.349
 Smoking your side is allowed here 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.569
 on the balcony what for example 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.970
 common among American companies 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.650
 is forbidden so do not scare me 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.359
 Now swivel up in the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.019
 look there 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:11.569
 there is the air conditioning as the air enters 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.940
 from and yes what some of you appreciate 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.120
 we will not like the air conditioning 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.979
 if you open the door so now 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.560
 it's just not possible at first why 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.050
 all this up here 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.820
 Locked is door lock so I turn 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.750
 so important now if he is the 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.210
 leave cabin 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.740
 really closed or right 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.510
 is the first one up there too 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.330
 locked so now I'm doing it 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.630
 times on and after some time then goes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.550
 because the air conditioning off so he has a 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.150
 or others of you will for sure 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.920
 estimate 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.300
 and now we come to the bathroom again 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.360
 or before we look 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.460
 times the control of the air conditioning to what 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.860
 Of course it is great that there are solid 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.810
 points are easy to hit 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.430
 That's always better than when 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.230
 you have such a regulator where that always so 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.790
 a bit and differentiated is where 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.630
 one always did not know exactly how to do it 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.580
 I then set 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.050
 but I think that's what you can do 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.090
 remember quite well if it gets hotter 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.810
 then he should be pressed once here 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.700
 on quick cool so hopps and then will 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.230
 the cabin cooled down i mean 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.240
 Imagine you are in the Caribbean 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.220
 or so it may be 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.990
 quite pleasant so here we go 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.450
 purely it burns like by chance 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.980
 not so we see yes he is me 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.100
 I am a fan of shower cubicles 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.830
 here is also one available next to it 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.350
 there are shower gel that does not exist here 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.490
 somehow things like that so 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.440
 shower gel we should probably for 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.080
 I do not use the hair here 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.020
 could have found for example 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.580
 hair shampoo body lotion that is available here 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.920
 Not everything but we see it when you see it 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.960
 times from the side of from outside 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.990
 a little bit look at this area 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.990
 is indeed designed efficiently so there is 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.880
 There are no no flaps or so you can 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.500
 open it can then everything is open 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.420
 But then of course has the advantage 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.850
 for this cleaning staff that it 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.440
 easy to clean is just like this 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.330
 Wipes that one hopes somehow 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.760
 built-in or something that is of course a lot 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.830
 easier to handle for the company 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.970
 and it works faster if that 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.880
 just standing around only a quarter open 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.230
 what is a nice one for everyone is 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.870
 me a bit of a taste so 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.400
 That's definitely easy 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.740
 yes I mean if you motel for example 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.170
 one knows this chain where now everything 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.790
 The design is efficient 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.760
 Honestly, a bit like that 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.650
 so from the sake of simplicity 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.430
 Make it a little bit that 's it 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.650
 we have under control 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.940
 so if you wanted to get up from the 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.250
 I can toilet 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.360
 Show again and so I hope 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.150
 you liked it please have a look 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.400
 at facebook facebook.com / ship 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.410
 tester and experience her of course 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.940
 everything from me and closed otherwise 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.050
 I hope we will be back soon or 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.050
 see you soon bye bye
