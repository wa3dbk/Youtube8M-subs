00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.380
 Unfortunately there is only a short stop 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 follow that in berlin am and one 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.759
 internship at the film a bit 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.629
 Umzugsstress am and no time for one 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.740
 had preview 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.040
 That's why I have a new one 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 This is a little news show 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.830
 and i will look that to you now 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.450
 upload every tuesday 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 do not be afraid it comes naturally 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.120
 many reviews and as I said leave me 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 I'm just going to spend some time with her and 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.239
 makes many overtime watching the movie 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.179
 and yes I 'm the thumb that everything 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.550
 works and here is the first episode of 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.440
 news show news sounds a bit stupid 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.699
 What a few views are so the first 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.769
 Of course there are news for the playstation 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.280
 4 as well as a bit sad that the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.280
 downward compatibility 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.659
 Downward compatibility is not great 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.710
 that sony wanted to see that 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.629
 Playstation 4 is based on the x86 chip 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.059
 that is easier then , of course, games 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.690
 implement and get more out of it 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.530
 tickle 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.509
 and as said loud sony is the same 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.360
 shit needed and playstation 3 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.649
 games not compatible with play 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 the playstation 4 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.700
 It will probably be too much technology 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 and seiferts awkward I think so 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 a bit of a pity, yes have to stop 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 keep playstation 3 a bit longer 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 I myself still have the old one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.640
 playstation 3 so the us playstation 3 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.560
 and can even be sudden 2 and so on 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.390
 let's play live games quite cool 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.200
 i suppose sony will not stay there 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.409
 let stitch and download games 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.329
 to offer 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.340
 and yes, let's just have a look 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.950
 Future brings then the place much 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.119
 the xbox 720 is talked about 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.500
 somehow you would not know much name 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:52.460
 according to the technology blog, the xbox 720 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 cost around $ 500 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 Of course there are no proofs for this 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.530
 there is just one in the net 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.969
 small slot dombert the xbox 720 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 permanently connected to the internet 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.819
 and probably not working 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.819
 if you do not have dsl of course 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.740
 it on the world or yes even in 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.630
 Germany 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.790
 not in every place internet i had 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.780
 somehow 18 wants to be or am me 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.780
 20 was no dsl for example yes we 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.120
 have survived then without dsl and 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 yes it was pretty shitty if you 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.140
 Stop living in a village where it lives 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.740
 there is no broadband internet yet and you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.300
 can somehow even gamble no xbox 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.430
 Just wait until there are new news 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.770
 admit I think microsoft is not like that 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.850
 stupid to pack that with the xbox 720 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.110
 I find that a stupid name like 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.770
 should rather have a few thoughts 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.380
 do 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.580
 a pretty shitty news for me 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.920
 since i am big metal fan i am even one 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.130
 autograph of video kojima ob my 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.690
 means healthy rips get the box 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.120
 have 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 david haye is no longer a spokesman 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.880
 Metal was healthy, I think that's pretty 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.870
 do not find shit 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.560
 david haider heidel handle and the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.030
 So to speak, agree with snake and big boss 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.130
 pretty cool I actually think so 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.600
 rather sad that he is not 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.570
 he has more on board on twitter 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.890
 announces that he is no longer with us 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.510
 that konami, so to speak, is against him 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.680
 has decided and he has nothing 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.460
 could do it 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.640
 I think shit hope that they are there 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.230
 somehow justify that in the dori 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.000
 why he speaks differently now 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.340
 quiet is also a mantra protagonist 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.250
 that somehow looks the same and he does 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.990
 he is just looking at it 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.790
 Actually, that was metal gear for me 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.450
 solid 4 guns of the patriots the story 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.420
 over 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.980
 I'm very good at the end even on 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.500
 end it was just a great deal 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.540
 this whole series of games and yes I am 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.460
 curious what now with metal healthy 5 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.770
 the culprit is not there 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.440
 means there are already times 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.230
 four out of five points in the value scale 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.240
 so people that's it already 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.520
 my little news show is yes 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.890
 a few more minutes now 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.239
 not as elaborate as the country blues 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.959
 this one I had promised you 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.479
 soon again 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.449
 reviews to make new episodes of dave 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.940
 so long will I gamble this 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.690
 to make news and I think so 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.479
 also something nice 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.169
 it now can be heard more and more with 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.520
 to look i somehow shit tells 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.740
 I hope there are a few next week 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.389
 better news than this week great 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.800
 only slight with the lousy 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.400
 to start 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.720
 well not so expensive it will be better me 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.250
 wish you a nice week moved 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.250
 diligently doing well
