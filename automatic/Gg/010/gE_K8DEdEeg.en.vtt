00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
think that if we get more games like

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.129 
think that if we get more games like
this<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:33.049> have<00:03:33.259> that<00:03:33.669> inspiration<00:03:34.669> I<00:03:35.139> really

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
this that have that inspiration I really

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.110 
this that have that inspiration I really

need<00:03:40.609> now<00:03:41.030> as<00:03:41.180> much<00:03:41.329> as<00:03:41.479> I<00:03:41.570> am<00:03:41.690> praising<00:03:42.259> the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
need now as much as I am praising the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.379 
need now as much as I am praising the
fact<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.859> game<00:03:43.100> is<00:03:43.130> going<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.639> revive

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.539 
fact that this game is going to revive
the<00:03:44.870> whole<00:03:45.019> couch<00:03:45.290> co-op<00:03:45.680> experience<00:03:45.979> I

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
the whole couch co-op experience I

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.849 
the whole couch co-op experience I
really<00:03:47.299> do<00:03:47.449> think<00:03:47.720> though<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.019> this<00:03:48.590> game

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
really do think though that this game

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.740 
really do think though that this game
definitely<00:03:49.190> needs<00:03:49.850> some<00:03:50.000> online<00:03:50.299> multiplayer

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
definitely needs some online multiplayer

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.689 
definitely needs some online multiplayer
I<00:03:51.199> mean<00:03:51.440> yeah<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.650> understand<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.549> they<00:03:52.669> are

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
I mean yeah I understand that they are

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.340 
I mean yeah I understand that they are
really<00:03:53.030> debating<00:03:53.509> it<00:03:53.630> when<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.930> comes<00:03:54.109> down<00:03:54.290> to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
really debating it when it comes down to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.469 
really debating it when it comes down to
like<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.739> ps4<00:03:55.009> the<00:03:55.370> xbox<00:03:55.699> one<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.150> wii<00:03:56.299> u

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
like the ps4 the xbox one of the wii u

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.539 
like the ps4 the xbox one of the wii u
in<00:03:57.259> hopes<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.620> they<00:03:57.739> get<00:03:57.949> like<00:03:58.070> unity

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
in hopes that they get like unity

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.659 
in hopes that they get like unity
support<00:03:58.910> but<00:03:59.600> honestly<00:04:00.109> i<00:04:00.650> think<00:04:00.709> right<00:04:01.459> now

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
support but honestly i think right now

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.999 
support but honestly i think right now
when<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.000> comes<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.419> pc<00:04:02.780> port<00:04:02.959> i<00:04:03.229> think<00:04:03.859> it

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:04.009 
when it comes to the pc port i think it

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.680 
when it comes to the pc port i think it
does<00:04:04.220> need<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.579> online<00:04:04.970> multiplayer<00:04:05.269> because

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
does need the online multiplayer because

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.529 
does need the online multiplayer because
you<00:04:05.870> would<00:04:05.989> have<00:04:06.169> such<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.799> massive<00:04:07.100> audience

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:07.539 
you would have such a massive audience

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.870 
you would have such a massive audience
for<00:04:08.539> this<00:04:09.229> sort<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.709> game<00:04:09.949> when<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.280> comes<00:04:10.519> to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
for this sort of game when it comes to

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.479 
for this sort of game when it comes to
an<00:04:11.150> online<00:04:11.509> multiplayer<00:04:12.049> really<00:04:13.009> when<00:04:13.220> you

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
an online multiplayer really when you

games of all time stuff like that is a

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.290 
games of all time stuff like that is a
great<00:04:27.620> example<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:28.250> why<00:04:28.370> online<00:04:28.850> multiplayer

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
great example of why online multiplayer

great example of why online multiplayer
works<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.900> think<00:04:30.199> crawl<00:04:30.560> would<00:04:30.830> give<00:04:31.009> that

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
works and I think crawl would give that

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.210 
works and I think crawl would give that
a<00:04:31.430> run<00:04:31.639> for<00:04:31.910> its<00:04:32.030> money<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.870> overall<00:04:33.380> um<00:04:33.800> I

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
a run for its money but overall um I

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.340

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.600 
fucking good it made like 10,000 sales
in<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:56.570> first<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:57.410> think<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.830> first<00:04:57.979> week<00:04:58.340> and

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
in the first I think the first week and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360 
in the first I think the first week and
it<00:04:59.479> can<00:04:59.660> only<00:04:59.780> go<00:04:59.990> up<00:05:00.020> from<00:05:00.169> there<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.710> this<00:05:01.250> is

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
it can only go up from there and this is

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.550 
it can only go up from there and this is
an<00:05:01.460> early<00:05:01.580> access<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.270> so<00:05:02.600> when<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:03.110> comes<00:05:03.289> down

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
an early access to so when it comes down

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.670 
an early access to so when it comes down
to<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:04.039> it's<00:05:05.030> gonna<00:05:05.300> only<00:05:05.509> do<00:05:05.780> better<00:05:06.020> based<00:05:06.470> on

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
to it it's gonna only do better based on

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.680 
to it it's gonna only do better based on
if<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.949> guys<00:05:07.160> check<00:05:07.699> it<00:05:07.819> out<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.330> stuff<00:05:08.509> like

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
if you guys check it out and stuff like

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.499 
if you guys check it out and stuff like
that<00:05:08.750> without<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:10.160> online<00:05:10.789> multiplayer<00:05:11.120> it's

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
that without the online multiplayer it's

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.870 
that without the online multiplayer it's
still<00:05:11.930> good<00:05:12.199> I<00:05:12.470> just<00:05:13.220> think<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.580> online

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
still good I just think the online

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.610 
still good I just think the online
multiplayer<00:05:14.210> could<00:05:14.690> make<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.990> exponentially

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
multiplayer could make it exponentially

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.379 
multiplayer could make it exponentially
