magma<00:01:13.770> red<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.840> think<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> nicest<00:01:16.320> color

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
magma red I think it's the nicest color

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.440 
magma red I think it's the nicest color
there's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.070> blue<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> white<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there's a blue one and a white one I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.850 
there's a blue one and a white one I
think<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> red<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.580> best-looking<00:01:21.060> one

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860
