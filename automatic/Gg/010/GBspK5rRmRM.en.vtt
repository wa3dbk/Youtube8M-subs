00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 as far as psychologically 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.190
 It will be hard to fight in Moscow where everything 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.110

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.330
 preparation went very well she already 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.259
 In the mood the most important thing is that I am very 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.630

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.650
 pressure is not thought even not so 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.629
 channel in the working moment of shooting 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.230
 coaching interviews something like that not 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.579
 worry 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 when you start thinking about it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.380
 you know that is to represent another 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.210
 starts to press it with pressure that 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.989
 you understand that dice is typically the scene of the whole 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.420
 I only survived for the sake of one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.880
 see my fight see this show that is 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.799
 so a little bit when you think 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 starts to push try about it not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.900
 think that is, I know one thing that I need 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.390
 colorful municipality for at press time 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.450

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.240
 normal age more he knows against 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.920
 who's great at it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.390
 he motivated two months preparing for 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.369
 afraid of this i know what the rules are 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 good training camp 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.530
 you know it as we have many journalists 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.680
 begins of before the battles to decide 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 write a rant about how 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 I remember not so long ago an article 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 Alexander Whitey who simply 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.220
 wrote that floor before the fight so what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.650
 there italki faith is anyone like that 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.410
 basically pass to one foot or 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.260
 and after the fight I just had to apologize 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.690
 in front of the fans between sorry I'm just 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.950
 I did not expect, and the like for some reason 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.990
 we are professionals so be 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.970
 by professionals as i need in russian 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.000
 words this is personal boxing everything happens 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.220
 Anything I can take very seriously 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.130
 this attitude who got fights on 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.000
 faith and the past in theory it won to 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.800
 I think where they understand the truth stool 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 drink it look about and even happened 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.000
 what happened therefore exists from from 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.320
 this is the story I have already said what 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.060
 Thank God that is put everything its 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.800
 places you understand i will be a champion again 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.850
 of the world there must be that's all that is 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.510
 for me it's just a little. 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.880
 who are strong people here checks 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.300
 the most important thing is not to give up and go ahead 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.450
 your goal 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.450

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
 and mother and delirium in the yard heated of course 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.340
 maybe of course it is possible 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.110
 he sees and now it is not known but although 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.470
 lives say we do it 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.930
 everybody wants me to turn it on so 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.500
 just need to believe this thoughts 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.320
 are material 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 find implemented I think that when 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.840
 it will happen 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.460
 of the river is also easier when the river 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.800
 the opponent leads the click directory of the skartele 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.540
 that is, very friendly or just like that 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.910
 Mike Alvarado who promised to return 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.940
 on fpl spoke a bunch of nasty things 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.880

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.490

 raising can there ratings fights there once 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.440
 for the promotion of the battle you would be most important 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.370
 personal attitude 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.639
 I am always respectful to everyone 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.500

 professional bob industry i'm happy 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.990

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.409
 the show and what we start with us 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.959

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.089
 worth waiting for when there will be a contract 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.069
 Vladimir Mikhailovich 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.719
 Andrei Andrei Mikhailovich as said 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.789

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.969
 begins there now so that there will be it in 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.499
