00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone in today's video os 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 I bring a comparison between the camera 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.700
 of action sj 4000 and the go pro hero 4 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.410
 silver edition this go pro is the one that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.710
 It has rear touch screen and it costs 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.020
 about the 370 euros the sj 4000 that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 used is the version with wi-fi but 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.470
 as I said in some videos of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
 this channel has exactly the same 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.320
 characteristics and quality that the sj 4000 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.689
 normal the version without wifi of the sj 4000 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.179
 you can find it for about 64 euros in 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.940
 china and for about 80 euros the version with 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.309
 You can also buy Wi-Fi in Amazon 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.500
 Spain a tad more expensive if you are interested 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 have her in a few days at home in the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 description of the video I left you the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 links to the cameras in case you're interested 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 buy both the go pro and the sj 4000 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 right now both cameras are being 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 taking the images at 1080p at 30 frames 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.770
 per second as I said many 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 times the sj 4000 is a camera that does not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.030
 has a rival in terms of quality price 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.210
 because for about sixty and a few euros 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 we have more than decent results 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 considering this I wanted to do 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.460
 this comparison with the silver version 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.770
 of the latest go pro model for what 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.590
 how both cameras behave in front of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 front is go pro pro hero has a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 fantastic quality and a lot of modes 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 of recording for example we can take 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 images at 1080 to 60 frames per second 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 and at 720p at 120 30 per second something that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.520
 the sj 4000 does not have as you are seeing 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.070
 the images of the video the sj 4000 in 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.690
 1080 to 30 frames per second is capable of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 hold the guy having good 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.040
 images although the colors are a bit 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.560
 darker and bluish than in the case of 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.300
 the go pro and under my point of view the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.340
 of the latter are a little more faithful 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.080
 to reality as we are talking about the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 color theme in both cameras has been 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.960
 left the default values ie 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.140
 in the case of the sj 4100 hdr balance 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.240
 automatic targets and exposure 00 and in 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.700
 the case of the go pro I've left the field 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.850
 of vision in the mean value we can 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.920
 select broad mean values ​​and 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.720
 narrow then I'm going to shut up 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.369
 for a minute for you to listen 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.789
 how to record audio each of the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.789
 cameras 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.870
 this video that you are watching now is 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.049
 recorded with the go pro hero 4 at 1080p a 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.540
 60 frames per second and with the sj 4000 a 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.310
 1080 to 30 frames per second and I've 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.590
 halved the speed of 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 playback in this case wins the go pro 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.250
 since it is capable of recording more 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 images in a second and they get 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.310
 better results when we put the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.709
 slow motion video 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.599
 another interesting thing about cameras 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.810
 is that the go pro hero 4 has 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.700
 bluetooth wifi connectivity and the sj 4000 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.470
 has wifi in one of its versions 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.569
 this feature is useful for 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.800
 control the cameras of a tablet or 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.990
 smartphone 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.150
 both cameras can be used from 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.980
 a device with andré or to them and in 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.050
 principle there is also version for 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.790
 windows phone in the go pro though 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.860
 some comments say no 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.720
 works with this last camera but 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.910
 let's hope they solve it soon with 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.350
 an update of the app this video 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.170
 what are you seeing now is recorded 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.570
 only with the go pro hero 4 since 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.920
 the sj 4000 does not have the capacity to 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.390
 record at 720p at 120 frames per second 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.000
 they have the option to do it at 60 frames 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.980
 per second but double the frames by 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.620
 what really is as if only 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.600
 I did it at 30 frames per second this 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.340
 video I have reduced his speed four 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.200
 times so you can see how the slow is 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.340
 motion while these play are playing 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.340
 to the shovels on the beach 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.009
 in this case we are seeing how it 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
 they behave the cameras in conditions of 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.720
 very few leds on the one hand we see that the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.090
 go pro hero 4 has one more image 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.430
 illuminated but because of this it gets a lot 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.110
 more noise in the capture surely this 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.449
 It happens because in low light conditions 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.950
 it increases its sensitivity ciço to more values 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.890
 high and produces this effect 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.870
 on the other side the sj 4000 sings less 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.170
 light but in return the image has less 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.170
 noise 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.360
 in the photographic section it is 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.520
 street the victory to the go pro a turn the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.280
 image that you see is taken out with the s j 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.130
 4000 with its 3 megapixel sensor and 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.560
 it has modest results instead 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.930
 the go pro hero 4 with its 12 sensor 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.670
 megapixels and the option to be able to adjust 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.440
 the exposure depending on the light 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.660
 we can get pretty results 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.030
 curious for the size of the camera 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.370
 in the physical aspect both cameras are 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.020
 very aesthetically similar 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.870
 differences the distribution of 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.450
 buttons the go pro turn gives a feeling 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.190
 of better construction something that turns out 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.500
 obvious because of the price difference that 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.780
 there is between both cameras regarding the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.660
 weight the sj 4000 with battery and without 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.940
 water housing one gram weights and the 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.030
 go pro with battery and without its casing 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.070
 water weighs 81 grams I want to remember you 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.020
 that I recently created account for 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.730
