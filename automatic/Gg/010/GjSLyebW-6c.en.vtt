00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.799
 see a recipe that was requested 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 many times these beautiful cro 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.030
 St. 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 indeed croissants these croissants are 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 really very very soft but affected 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.949
 very easy to prepare and I am 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
 perfect for example if you want to freeze 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.029
 in the morning you want to have breakfast with a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.939
 something good you warm them up a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.609
 little and always at hand 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.099
 really really delicious have a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.809
 very good smell in the stuffed we have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 with a jam pitcher 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.239
 brothers 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
 however if you count the new tracks 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.469
 right away how it's done 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.899
 let's start by putting in our 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:49.980
 basket in the bread machine of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:52.860
 liquid we pour the milk there 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.960
 we add the sugar we put also 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.969
 the flour salt intrigues mona flour 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.770
 wholemeal we use only and flour 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.570
 full as usual you can too 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.180
 put other types of flour and over there 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.439
 let's put the yeast as the last 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.909
 ingredient 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.950
 at this point we put in the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.159
 bread machine and we have plans 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.930
 for the dough we choose the number 10 for 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.009
 now all the time that it would be an hour and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 half 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.180
 we only spend half an hour doing that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950
 it's the time dedicated to the dough 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.930
 so let's use the car of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 bread only and exclusively for 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.659
 kneading it then cooking levitation all over 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.060
 how much will be done outside so you can 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.229
 also use a common kneader 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 after half an hour our brioche 6 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.659
 well kneaded now we complain not to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.510
 this keep under put some flour 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.270
 look at how 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.520
 it was good and very very elastic the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.260
 place despite then it is all flour 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.240
 integral is from state very well 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.190
 much like kneading the bread machine 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.990
 if you do it with the normal mixer 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.730
 considered more or less the same time 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.710
 of kneading then at least one 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.740
 half an hour 20 minutes 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.390
 if you do by hand maybe even a little bit of 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.310
 more 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 in short it depends on the size you are strong 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.120
 how much verb puts us that for data is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 perfect 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.250
 after two hours this is the result 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.950
 then our dough leavened well e 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.520
 now we can start open forming i 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.260
 our ovens then dusted a 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.290
 some flour on the floor 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.800
 we overturn the pasta and now the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.960
 we lay down and very soft I realized 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.500
 that the door is important therefore it 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.660
 I split it in half and I'll do two rounds say 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.660
 so I can spread it better 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.230
 we live our pasta in slices 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.240
 therefore in total eight segments 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.700
 now I'm going to fill them with the 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.770
 jam I become a jam 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.960
 home-made orange the fullest of 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.360
 I don't know if you see and it is buzzetti 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.490
 very good you obviously put the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.000
 jam you prefer or even one 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.190
 Hazelnut cream is important they were 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.940
 use a too liquid jam 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.780
 then it comes out with much 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.780
 ease in cooking 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.990
 we click on a baking sheet with the paper 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.000
 oven a little apart from each other 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.280
 as you can see I am not very good at 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.220
 to give shape to the croissants I really do 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.770
 otherwise you will surely be better than 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.770
 me and I'm calling the surface 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.800
 now we can let you rise 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.410
 once again it is the rival to put 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.240
 in the warm oven here alone or with the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790
 light on position 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.870
 that setting of the warming al 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.910
 place of housing after about two hours i 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.060
 cornet ribbons are beautiful leavened yes 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.360
 they are stained and they are not wonderful 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.360
 then we put them in the oven at 175 degrees 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.020
 our croissants came out of the oven 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.449
 they just cooked about 20 minutes 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.719
 you see that the surface starts at 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.999
 to become golden and you will have to do it right away 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.969
 first they are raw and later they are 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.789
 beautiful beautiful golden turn off because it wants 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.650
 say that they are ready and they are wonderful 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.360
 I can't wait to eat because I can't 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.860
 I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning for 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.169
 have breakfast there 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.839
 obviously you can fill them with all the 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.490
 types of jams you can fill with 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.969
 chocolate creams from eg 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.479
 we made a like Nutella made 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.969
 home 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.060
 examples of this are written in person 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.330
 that would be really good 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.099
 very beautifull 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.080
 I really hope the recipe is there 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.889
 liked it sends me a kiss I'll see you there 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.889
 see you soon. Bye 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.210
