things but the key I think if you're

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.530 
things but the key I think if you're
wearing<00:02:24.370> these<00:02:24.489> out<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.849> when<00:02:24.999> I<00:02:25.030> notice<00:02:25.420> when

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
tracking through the snow it wicks away

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.860 
tracking through the snow it wicks away
the<00:02:32.920> sweat<00:02:33.400> from<00:02:33.549> your<00:02:33.639> feet<00:02:33.969> which<00:02:34.299> is<00:02:34.450> really

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the sweat from your feet which is really

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.030 
the sweat from your feet which is really
important<00:02:35.139> because<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.379> your<00:02:35.530> feet<00:02:35.769> get<00:02:35.980> wet

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
important because if your feet get wet

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.860 
important because if your feet get wet
and<00:02:36.519> if<00:02:36.819> you're<00:02:36.939> wearing<00:02:37.120> cotton<00:02:37.450> socks

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
and if you're wearing cotton socks

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.530 
and if you're wearing cotton socks
you're<00:02:38.769> done<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.849> you're<00:02:40.000> gonna<00:02:40.090> get<00:02:40.329> all

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you're done because you're gonna get all

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.000 
you're done because you're gonna get all
that<00:02:40.599> moisture<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.349> there<00:02:41.469> and<00:02:41.650> it's<00:02:41.859> gonna

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
that moisture in there and it's gonna

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.789 
that moisture in there and it's gonna
basically<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:42.819> your<00:02:43.359> boots<00:02:43.659> wet<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
basically get your boots wet and you

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.349 
basically get your boots wet and you
need<00:02:44.980> something<00:02:45.249> that<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.730> wake<00:02:46.000> away<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
need something that can wake away the

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.390 
need something that can wake away the
moisture<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.959> allow<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.379> to<00:02:47.409> escape<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.189> one

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
moisture and allow it to escape so one

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.920 
moisture and allow it to escape so one
you<00:02:48.519> probably<00:02:48.760> need<00:02:48.909> to<00:02:48.939> have<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.540> right<00:02:49.689> type

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
you probably need to have the right type

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.569 
you probably need to have the right type
of<00:02:49.959> boots<00:02:50.260> on<00:02:50.409> which<00:02:50.590> allow<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:50.889> moisture<00:02:51.159> to

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
of boots on which allow the moisture to

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.429 
of boots on which allow the moisture to
to<00:02:51.819> escape<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.750> other<00:02:52.870> part<00:02:53.139> is<00:02:53.199> you

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
to escape but the other part is you

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.259 
to escape but the other part is you
don't<00:02:53.590> want<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.159> moisture<00:02:54.669> next<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> your

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
don't want that moisture next to your

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.059 
don't want that moisture next to your
feet<00:02:55.540> because<00:02:56.109> your<00:02:56.260> boots<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.709> get<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.889> little

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
feet because your boots can get a little

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.289 
feet because your boots can get a little
bit<00:02:57.219> wet<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.519> they<00:02:57.579> can<00:02:57.730> absorb<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.180> certain

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
bit wet and they can absorb a certain

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.929 
bit wet and they can absorb a certain
amount<00:02:58.629> of<00:02:58.659> moisture<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.829> your<00:03:00.310> feet<00:03:00.669> get

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
amount of moisture but if your feet get

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.550 
amount of moisture but if your feet get
wet<00:03:00.969> and<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.719> start<00:03:01.870> getting<00:03:02.139> cool<00:03:02.349> air
