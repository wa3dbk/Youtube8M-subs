00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.070
 hello very good for the next game 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.710
 that I show you next 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.950
 you will pick up a deck will be delivered to 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.129
 viewer so that he freely 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.320
 Mix once mixed before 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.050
 that you give it to him you ask him to do 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.090
 the next thing you put on the table the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.449
 shuffle upright and take it 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.369
 something of weight can be a mobile can 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.320
 be a step a bottle what you think 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.849
 convenient and that you try to make 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.240
 balance the top of the deck 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.070
 holding the glass and see if it is capable 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.530
 to hold the rod that is something this 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.960
 hallway of course if you do not stay 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.149
 no deck 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.930
 try to be lived at the moment when 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.570
 see that it is impossible to give you in 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.149
 the low and you proceed to perform the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.510
 defect of agreement therefore you do what 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.800
 what commented below you take what 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.780
 I do with a mobile gives exactly the same 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.339
 this is to make a balance you put the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 mobile on top and proceed to perform 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:10.030
 a little bit more back balance with your 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.710
 shuffle to see your audience that your deck 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.600
 holds the mobile in vertical position and 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 there is a mobile index says glass or because 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.759
 another thing if you dare a little more 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.280
 then you can carry it out with something that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.140
 yes that contains liquid if you have 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.330
 guarantor and those of the street did not 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.619
 just that but also you will be able to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.350
 make an extension to see if I get 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.270
 fairly dignified that the trials to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.720
 Sometimes it falls depends on how we extend 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 the cards will extend the cards 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.600
 so that these protrude 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.430
 perfect good and this way 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.479
 obviously you completely defy 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.600
 the law of gravity before the eyes 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.659
 stupefied of your audience finalizes the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.290
 game by extracting the mobile from above 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.990
 the low and checking that is 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.930
 evidently it falls without further ado 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.810
 the weight that contained over game very 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.440
 simple to make but very impressive in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.900
 a next video if you like it 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.740
 sometimes you forget a little bit of it 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.640
 Well I revealed it thank you very much 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.640
 is already next video
