00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.110 

I<00:03:32.340> guess<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.459> should<00:03:33.640> do<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.819> for<00:03:33.849> four<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:36.120> want

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
I guess I should do it for four I want

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.539 
I guess I should do it for four I want
to<00:03:37.180> do<00:03:37.359> this<00:03:37.510> now<00:03:37.959> can<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.010> do<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.219> for<00:03:39.250> four<00:03:39.519> or

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
to do this now can I do it for four or

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.770 
to do this now can I do it for four or
not<00:03:40.140> completely<00:03:41.140> lose<00:03:41.349> out<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:42.750> want<00:03:43.750> to

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
not completely lose out like I want to

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.759 
not completely lose out like I want to
keep<00:03:43.930> at<00:03:44.109> least<00:03:44.140> think<00:03:44.859> twice<00:03:45.129> a<00:03:45.489> creature<00:03:48.389> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
keep at least think twice a creature and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.740 
keep at least think twice a creature and
another<00:03:50.769> spell<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.939> mystic<00:03:52.269> retrieval<00:03:52.719> I

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
another spell for mystic retrieval I

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.649 
another spell for mystic retrieval I
guess<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.079> can't<00:03:53.290> do<00:03:53.439> that<00:03:53.469> i<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:55.209> keep<00:03:55.359> think

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
guess I can't do that i can keep think

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.910 
guess I can't do that i can keep think
twice<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.139> a<00:03:56.200> creature<00:03:56.530> i<00:03:56.560> think<00:03:56.769> that's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
twice and a creature i think that's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.440 
twice and a creature i think that's
because<00:03:57.400> i<00:03:57.549> want<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.760> give<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:57.909> creature<00:03:58.180> for

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
because i want to give a creature for

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.280 
because i want to give a creature for
the<00:03:59.159> three<00:04:00.159> for<00:04:00.340> flyer<00:04:00.639> right<00:04:00.879> i<00:04:01.150> think<00:04:01.959> in

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
the three for flyer right i think in

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.589 
the three for flyer right i think in
that<00:04:02.409> case<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.709> just<00:04:02.980> do<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.099> for<00:04:03.189> two<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:09.599> don't

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
that case I just do it for two I don't

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
he's got some very good cards in hand as

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.820 
he's got some very good cards in hand as

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
we put in 24 and then have brimstone

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:10.350 
we put in 24 and then have brimstone
volley<00:05:00.860> next<00:05:01.370> turn<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:09.500> would<00:05:09.620> need<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.770> have

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
volley next turn you would need to have

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.120 
volley next turn you would need to have
the<00:05:11.360> plus<00:05:11.570> two<00:05:11.720> plus<00:05:11.750> two<00:05:11.930> pump<00:05:12.350> which<00:05:12.950> he

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
the plus two plus two pump which he

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.680 
the plus two plus two pump which he
didn't<00:05:13.400> have<00:05:13.550> last<00:05:13.970> her<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.270> I<00:05:14.300> don't<00:05:14.450> thinks

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
didn't have last her and I don't thinks

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.540 
didn't have last her and I don't thinks
I'm<00:05:14.810> pretty<00:05:14.900> sure<00:05:15.140> he<00:05:15.200> would<00:05:15.350> have<00:05:15.380> used<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.430> on

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
I'm pretty sure he would have used it on

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:27.940 
I'm pretty sure he would have used it on
the<00:05:16.730> priest<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:26.750> unless<00:05:26.960> it's<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.380> guess<00:05:27.680> like<00:05:27.890> a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
the priest so unless it's I guess like a

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.600 
the priest so unless it's I guess like a
a<00:05:29.020> wall<00:05:30.020> of<00:05:30.260> some<00:05:30.470> sort<00:05:30.710> like<00:05:30.950> which<00:05:31.490> he

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
a wall of some sort like which he

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.790 
a wall of some sort like which he
doesn't<00:05:31.760> have<00:05:32.000> clearly<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:33.020> also<00:05:33.530> raised

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
doesn't have clearly so I also raised

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.120 
doesn't have clearly so I also raised
for<00:05:34.010> but<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.630> think<00:05:36.970> that<00:05:38.380> I<00:05:39.380> just<00:05:39.740> win<00:05:39.980> with

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
for but I think that I just win with

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:50.350 
for but I think that I just win with
brimstone<00:05:40.400> volley<00:05:40.610> here<00:05:41.090> so

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.490 

whereas<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.510> guess<00:05:51.690> he<00:05:51.810> could<00:05:51.960> have<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.110> removal

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
whereas I guess he could have a removal

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.760 
whereas I guess he could have a removal
spell<00:05:52.680> like<00:05:53.420> smite<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.540> monstrous<00:05:54.990> for<00:05:55.290> rage

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
spell like smite the monstrous for rage

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.980 
spell like smite the monstrous for rage
thorough<00:05:58.520> so<00:05:59.520> he<00:05:59.670> goes<00:05:59.790> to<00:05:59.850> four<00:06:02.840> meaning<00:06:03.840> if

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
thorough so he goes to four meaning if

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.270 
thorough so he goes to four meaning if
he<00:06:04.080> doesn't<00:06:04.350> block<00:06:04.470> his<00:06:04.650> hit<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.890> rim<00:06:05.070> stone

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
he doesn't block his hit the rim stone

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.680 
he doesn't block his hit the rim stone
ball<00:06:05.490> if<00:06:05.580> he<00:06:05.670> does<00:06:05.820> block<00:06:06.120> it's<00:06:06.300> with<00:06:06.480> like<00:06:06.660> a

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
ball if he does block it's with like a

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.950 
ball if he does block it's with like a
the<00:06:07.560> two<00:06:07.740> one<00:06:07.950> death<00:06:08.160> touch<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.700> I<00:06:08.940> get<00:06:09.120> morbid

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
the two one death touch and I get morbid

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:32.890 
the two one death touch and I get morbid
kill<00:06:14.390> ya<00:06:15.390> hell<00:06:15.630> right<00:06:15.780> it's<00:06:15.930> good

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.510 

or<00:06:33.900> it<00:06:33.990> could<00:06:34.110> be<00:06:34.139> that<00:06:34.320> guy<00:06:34.530> that's<00:06:34.710> same<00:06:35.280> deal

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520
