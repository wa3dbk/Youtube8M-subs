interesting<00:00:14.549> blocks<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.849> Minecraft<00:00:15.000> because

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
interesting blocks in Minecraft because

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.180 
interesting blocks in Minecraft because
that<00:00:15.719> does<00:00:15.839> such<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.109> simple<00:00:16.440> function<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.039> can

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
that does such a simple function but can

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.370 
that does such a simple function but can
do<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.640> much<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.090> function<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.690> not

crafting recipe very easy to make
because<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:36.660> easy<00:00:36.690> those<00:00:37.110> things<00:00:37.290> ought

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
because of how easy those things ought

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.560 
because of how easy those things ought
to<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.520> basically<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.090> does<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to get and basically what it does is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
to get and basically what it does is
when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.079> left<00:00:40.350> trick<00:00:40.770> click<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.309> use<00:00:41.640> your

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
thing it just by itself it is just a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
thing it just by itself it is just a
simple<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.199> keep<00:00:58.410> yourself

amused<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.160> hitting<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.489> block<00:00:59.670> sort<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> thing

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
amused by hitting a block sort of thing

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
amused by hitting a block sort of thing
but<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.620> used<00:01:01.859> really

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
but the way it can be used really

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.740 
but the way it can be used really
effectively<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:02.940> cool<00:01:03.239> e<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.570> when

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
effectively and really cool e is when

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
effectively and really cool e is when
you<00:01:03.840> combine<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> stuff<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.939> first

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you combine a lot of stuff so first

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.890 
you combine a lot of stuff so first
thing<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.780> use<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
thing you can do is you can use a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
thing you can do is you can use a
redstone<00:01:07.170> charge<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.890> charge<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
redstone charge to charge it and this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
redstone charge to charge it and this
will<00:01:09.479> basically<00:01:09.570> allow<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> hit<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.260> from

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
will basically allow you to hit it from

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
will basically allow you to hit it from
you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.070> remotely<00:01:11.490> from<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> distance<00:01:12.119> I'll

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you know remotely from a distance I'll

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
you know remotely from a distance I'll
just<00:01:12.420> show<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.689> close<00:01:12.720> its<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> blocker

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
just show you up close its the blocker

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
just show you up close its the blocker
which<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> cool<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.479> means<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> can

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
which is cool so it means that you can

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.270 
which is cool so it means that you can
have<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> pressure<00:01:16.320> plate<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.770> makes<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> sound

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
have a pressure plate that makes a sound

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160

jukebox<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.729> shortly<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.149> believe<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> one

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.649 
jukebox very shortly I believe in one
the<00:01:49.049> coming<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.770> upcoming<00:01:50.159> updates<00:01:50.759> but

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the coming up upcoming updates but

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.300 
the coming up upcoming updates but
currently<00:01:51.960> only<00:01:52.049> goes<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.710> 15<00:01:52.860> blocks

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
currently only goes up to like 15 blocks

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.350 
currently only goes up to like 15 blocks
so<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> hear<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> whole

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so if you want have to hear the whole

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.120 
so if you want have to hear the whole
song<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> still<00:01:55.320> follow<00:01:55.500> along<00:01:55.860> or

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's quite difficult right now next

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.920 
it's quite difficult right now next
blocks<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.619> increased<00:01:59.040> shortly<00:01:59.930> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
blocks bit will be increased shortly so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
blocks bit will be increased shortly so
yeah<00:02:01.049> next<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> list<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
yeah next thing on the list is a the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.130 
yeah next thing on the list is a the
instrument<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.719> might<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:04.020> if

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
instrument so as you might know if

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
instrument so as you might know if
you've<00:02:04.229> experimented<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.950> looks<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.340> err

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you've experimented it looks a lot err

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.130 
you've experimented it looks a lot err
you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> make<00:02:06.180> different<00:02:06.329> sounds<00:02:06.840> based<00:02:07.020> on

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you can make different sounds based on

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
you can make different sounds based on
what<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.320> place<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.550> there's<00:02:08.789> even

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
what you place it on and there's even

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
what you place it on and there's even
the<00:02:09.090> placing<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.569> no<00:02:09.720> blocks<00:02:09.959> thing<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the placing on no blocks thing that you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
the placing on no blocks thing that you
can<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> figured<00:02:11.879> I'd<00:02:12.030> explain<00:02:12.599> how

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
can do and I figured I'd explain how

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.620 
can do and I figured I'd explain how
that<00:02:12.870> works<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
that works so

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.810 
that works so
all<00:02:14.170> blocks<00:02:14.920> are<00:02:15.100> grouped<00:02:15.250> into<00:02:15.430> five

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
all blocks are grouped into five

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820 
all blocks are grouped into five
categories<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.900> easiest<00:02:17.080> categories<00:02:17.560> star

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
categories the easiest categories star

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.610 
categories the easiest categories star
with<00:02:18.010> our<00:02:18.160> transparent<00:02:18.850> blocks<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.620> like

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
with our transparent blocks and like

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.950 
with our transparent blocks and like
block<00:02:21.040> based<00:02:21.310> blocks<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.480> first<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.900> all

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
block based blocks so first of all

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.930 
block based blocks so first of all
transparent<00:02:23.590> blocks<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.130> only<00:02:24.430> glass

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
transparent blocks this is only glass

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.110 
transparent blocks this is only glass
glass<00:02:25.300> panes<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.370> glowstone<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.000> makes

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
glass panes and glowstone and it makes

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.690 
glass panes and glowstone and it makes
this<00:02:28.240> sort<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.510> picking<00:02:28.750> sound<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.460> hard

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
this sort of picking sound it's so hard

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.040 
this sort of picking sound it's so hard
to<00:02:30.790> describe<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.630> very<00:02:31.780> useful<00:02:31.870> for

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
to describe it's not very useful for

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.390 
to describe it's not very useful for
anything<00:02:32.290> bits<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.010> if<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.250> wanna

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
something that's what this can be used

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.570 
something that's what this can be used

very slightly different slightly pitch
yeah<00:02:47.530> there's<00:02:47.740> several<00:02:47.860> they're<00:02:48.220> similar<00:02:48.430> not

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
yeah there's several they're similar not

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.610 
yeah there's several they're similar not
very<00:02:48.910> useful<00:02:49.270> so<00:02:49.540> those<00:02:49.900> six<00:02:50.200> blocks<00:02:50.440> will

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
very useful so those six blocks will

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.950 
very useful so those six blocks will
group<00:02:50.830> into<00:02:51.130> those<00:02:51.310> two<00:02:51.550> categories

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
group into those two categories

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.910 
group into those two categories
everything<00:02:52.960> else<00:02:53.110> fits<00:02:53.320> into<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:53.710> of<00:02:53.800> these

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
everything else fits into one of these

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.470 
everything else fits into one of these
other<00:02:54.220> three<00:02:54.490> categories<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.090> first<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.420> all

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
other three categories so first of all

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.450 
other three categories so first of all
there<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.170> stone<00:02:56.470> which<00:02:56.530> includes<00:02:57.130> ores

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
there is the stone which includes ores

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.460 
there is the stone which includes ores
includes<00:02:58.120> stone<00:02:58.750> bricks<00:02:59.020> includes

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
includes stone bricks includes

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.710 
includes stone bricks includes
everything<00:02:59.770> that's<00:02:59.980> really<00:03:00.490> solid<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.180> not

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
everything that's really solid and not

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.190 
everything that's really solid and not
really<00:03:02.020> woody<00:03:02.230> or<00:03:02.380> dirty<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.870> makes<00:03:05.050> this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
really woody or dirty and it makes this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.920 
really woody or dirty and it makes this
soft<00:03:05.410> sound<00:03:05.650> right<00:03:05.830> here<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.190> like<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.930> drum

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
soft sound right here it's like a drum

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.660 
soft sound right here it's like a drum
sort<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.290> sound<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> bass<00:03:08.740> drum<00:03:09.040> if<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.460> had<00:03:09.580> to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
sort of sound the bass drum if I had to

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.780 
sort of sound the bass drum if I had to
guess<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.290> quite<00:03:11.470> cool<00:03:11.740> but<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.190> can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
guess it's it's quite cool but and can

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.090 
guess it's it's quite cool but and can
be<00:03:12.880> used<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.210> spar<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.960> know<00:03:14.050> song<00:03:14.830> if<00:03:14.980> you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
be used to spar but you know song if you

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.650 
be used to spar but you know song if you
only<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.490> like<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.670> drum<00:03:15.970> or<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.180> beat<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.540> it

only have like a drum or a beat to it

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.410 
only have like a drum or a beat to it
you<00:03:17.020> know<00:03:17.320> do<00:03:17.560> doop<00:03:18.010> doop<00:03:18.400> doop<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.180> and

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
you know do doop doop doop like that and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.150 
you know do doop doop doop like that and
oh<00:03:19.630> yeah<00:03:19.780> that's<00:03:19.930> how<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.110> can<00:03:20.200> use<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
oh yeah that's how you can use that the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.710 
oh yeah that's how you can use that the
upper<00:03:21.280> two<00:03:21.400> types<00:03:21.640> there's<00:03:21.880> wood<00:03:22.150> which<00:03:22.540> will

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
upper two types there's wood which will

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.280 
upper two types there's wood which will
make<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.110> sore<00:03:23.740> I<00:03:24.340> guess<00:03:24.850> it's<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.480> don't<00:03:26.170> have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
make this sore I guess it's I don't have

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.320 
make this sore I guess it's I don't have
to<00:03:26.380> describe<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:27.160> makes<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.520> sound<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:28.240> then

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
to describe it makes this sound and then

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.270 
to describe it makes this sound and then
there's<00:03:28.570> dirt<00:03:29.020> or<00:03:29.230> no<00:03:29.560> blocks<00:03:29.830> or<00:03:30.040> anything

there's dirt or no blocks or anything

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.550 
there's dirt or no blocks or anything
along<00:03:30.880> those<00:03:31.060> lines<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.570> will<00:03:31.660> make<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.440> a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
along those lines it will make just a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.680 
along those lines it will make just a
piano<00:03:33.010> slash<00:03:33.400> harp<00:03:33.640> sound<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.480> what<00:03:34.630> you

each box that is not so next how does
the<00:03:52.990> pitch<00:03:53.170> work<00:03:53.470> also<00:03:53.980> this<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.400> building

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
the pitch work also this is all building

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.250 
the pitch work also this is all building
up<00:03:54.760> on<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.000> help<00:03:55.150> make<00:03:55.450> your<00:03:55.570> own<00:03:55.690> song<00:03:55.990> don't

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
you can see then every click after that

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500 
you can see then every click after that
will<00:04:11.680> take<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.490> one<00:04:12.700> along<00:04:12.940> things<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.390> this

happens when you go past 12 it just

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.010 
happens when you go past 12 it just
loops<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.250> put<00:04:39.580> 12<00:04:40.030> clicks<00:04:40.270> would<00:04:40.449> be<00:04:40.569> a<00:04:40.599> never

loops so put 12 clicks would be a never

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.159 
loops so put 12 clicks would be a never
F<00:04:41.800> hash<00:04:42.069> 13<00:04:42.639> clicks<00:04:42.819> would<00:04:42.970> be<00:04:43.090> G<00:04:43.270> etc<00:04:43.750> etc<00:04:43.810> etc
