00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
so before I throw a little music

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.130 
so before I throw a little music
together<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.969> maybe<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> build<00:02:06.810> video

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
together and maybe just do a build video

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.540 
together and maybe just do a build video
with<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> montage

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
with a montage

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.910 
with a montage
there's<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> couple<00:02:09.600> things<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.960> do<00:02:10.200> before<00:02:10.380> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
there's a couple things to do before you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.460 
there's a couple things to do before you
do<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.060> prep<00:02:12.270> him<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.480> for

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
do that to kind of prep him for for

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.560 
do that to kind of prep him for for
armor<00:02:14.040> up<00:02:14.190> mode<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.820> pull<00:02:15.060> his<00:02:15.180> arms<00:02:15.420> out

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
armor up mode and you pull his arms out

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.230 
armor up mode and you pull his arms out
like<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.790> thing<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.120> an

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
like this and then this thing is like an

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.090 
like this and then this thing is like an
eggshell<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.200> splits<00:02:19.560> right<00:02:19.740> up<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
eggshell and it splits right up the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.250 
eggshell and it splits right up the
middle<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.240> these<00:02:21.450> two<00:02:21.810> pieces

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
middle here you can see these two pieces

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.530 
middle here you can see these two pieces
are<00:02:22.560> spring-loaded<00:02:23.070> which<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.510> want

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
are spring-loaded which one do you want

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.270 
are spring-loaded which one do you want
to<00:02:24.720> grab<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.350> completely<00:02:25.740> spin<00:02:26.160> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
to grab that and completely spin it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.450 
to grab that and completely spin it
around<00:02:26.480> both<00:02:27.480> sides<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:28.800> makes<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
around both sides it now makes all of

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.630 
around both sides it now makes all of
his<00:02:29.850> chubbiness<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.350> heroic<00:02:32.160> looking

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
his chubbiness more so heroic looking

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.060 
his chubbiness more so heroic looking
the<00:02:33.390> bigger<00:02:33.540> part<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.990> up<00:02:34.170> there<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.800> he's<00:02:34.950> got

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the bigger part is up there and he's got

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.820 
the bigger part is up there and he's got
a<00:02:35.100> tapered<00:02:35.610> waist<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:36.240> opposed<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.830> nun

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
a tapered waist as opposed to a nun

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.390 
a tapered waist as opposed to a nun
tapered<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.790> pear-shaped<00:02:39.630> waist<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:41.340> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
tapered a pear-shaped waist I think you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800

can<00:02:41.550> pull<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> legs<00:02:42.090> out<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.570> bit

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
can pull the legs out just a little bit

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.170 
can pull the legs out just a little bit
too<00:02:43.140> maybe<00:02:43.680> not<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:45.000> going

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
too maybe not that's not really going

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.480 
too maybe not that's not really going
much<00:02:45.630> farther<00:02:45.870> than<00:02:46.140> where<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:46.920> now

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
much farther than where it is but now

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.760

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.629 
like that this is all armor armored up
in<00:04:21.870> an<00:04:21.989> armored<00:04:22.289> shell<00:04:22.560> now<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.490> have

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
in an armored shell now you just have

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
find quite annoying actually is that you

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.350 
find quite annoying actually is that you
have<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:32.280> shell<00:04:32.520> pieces<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.030> are<00:04:33.120> supposed

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
to stick together here they kind of

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.490 
to stick together here they kind of
enclose<00:04:36.000> his<00:04:36.270> arm<00:04:36.479> up<00:04:36.690> so<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.139> can<00:04:37.259> move<00:04:37.349> it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
around and stuff too but the little

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.510 
around and stuff too but the little
fists<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> way<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.800> hooks<00:04:41.039> in<00:04:41.280> its

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
fists the way that hooks in its

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.490 
fists the way that hooks in its
naturally<00:04:42.210> wanting<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.630> spread<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.199> and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
this is kind of a bad design but other

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.310
