00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:10.870
 let's check the sub fuse box 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.870
 of the rock that is under the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.870
 top 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.440
 the layer is written in Chinese 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.440
 we are going to translate it into Spanish 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 it is possible to start the first fuse 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.950
 up to number 10 and from 11 to 20 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.600
 the first 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.600
 commanded by the sheet 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.740
 with the ignition key 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.330
 the first 10 amp red fuse is 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.250
 started the system the second feeds the 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.130
 alternator 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.600
 the third is system home on 4 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.420
 Feeds the little pieces of the board 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.000
 when one opens contact with the sheet 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.350
 the brake bits of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 battery and so on 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.500
 that light 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:20.200
 the fifth fuse is back light 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.200
 here we have the reprocess light but 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.350
 reuters 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.730
 the sixth is a clinical ignition system 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.700
 we can explain you 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.350
 this is receives the number 1 system 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.690
 started the 2 feed the alternator on 3 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 system starts the 4 lights of the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.540
 spotlights hand-held belt and so on 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.830
 5 in the back light of 10 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.340
 amps 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.470
 the sixth also of 15 amps blue of 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.780
 15 amps system start hundred 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.910
 is controlled by the contact plate 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:06.920
 let's follow the 7 is free 8 so free 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:10.780
 the 9 is 15 amp blue color this is 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.240
 for the internal fan motor 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.300
 here we see the fan contact 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.670
 internal but works when the sheet 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.340
 is in the position of two or when the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.650
 engine is on works the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.650
 three speed fan 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 estefan 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.700
 works with the sheet in today's position 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.730
 is another cable that comes out 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.620
 of the key number 10 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.960
 there is nothing is empty let's say 11 and 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.390
 shot if no state has been 12 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.230
 is from the horn 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.480
 13 is from the memory of the radio that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.990
 goes to the central clock that keeps the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.640
 radio in memory 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:05.330
 the white and the third the 13 of the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.080
 memory of the clock radio 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:15.300
 let's say the 14 is free on 15 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:19.720
 active in the light of white light of the 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.320
 left side spotlights 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.770
 then fuse 14 when we activate 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.340
 it is turned around the entire board 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.410
 cement light board system 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.730
 the left part and the spotlights of the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.750
 license plate 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.730
 the number 16 parking light 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.410
 the right side note that they are colored 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.540
 orange are 5 amps 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.370
 then this is possible from the focus 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.300
 on the right side both from the back 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.300
 Forward 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.829
 the next the 17 that the king samperio 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.890
 of the miners' bulbs both forward 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:15.140
 as later 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.140
 the fog lights up here one 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.240
 they are later 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.240
 with the money in front 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.630
 God 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.289
 in functions does not tell me 18 is colored 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.899
 yellow are 20 amps 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:38.889
 this is connected to the brake light 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:42.330
 living room light and flashing light 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.330
 to the intermittent 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.010
 living bruce 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.010
 brake light 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.020
 in my mind 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.010
 the next possible the number 19 that 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.130
 also yellow since 20 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.750
 amp is connected to the pen or 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.320
 windshield wipers and the water trickle 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.120
 we put the key in accessory position and 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.120
 we activate the windshield wiper 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.290
 uncovers the breeze and the trickle of water and 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.620
 the last possible green color fuse 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.670
 blue is 15 amps this is 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.970
 connected to the radio and the cigarette lighter 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.450
 key position of accessory works the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.450
 radio 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.180
 the lighter impossible the number 20 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.880
 the lighter 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.100
 good all the possible ones that have the 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.040
 family 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.480
 the samperio rojito the blue and all of 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.400
 fifteen 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.400
 in the greater of 20 amps
