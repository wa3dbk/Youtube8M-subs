okay<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.190> tutorial<00:00:02.460> we're<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.600> be

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
okay in this tutorial we're going to be

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.120 
okay in this tutorial we're going to be
looking<00:00:03.959> at<00:00:04.110> finding<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.950> standard

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
looking at finding the standard

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.750 
looking at finding the standard
deviation<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.060> mean<00:00:06.859> excuse<00:00:07.859> me

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
deviation and mean excuse me

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.009 
deviation and mean excuse me
using<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:10.800> sharp<00:00:11.070> calculator<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:12.630> multiple

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
using the sharp calculator with multiple

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.369 
using the sharp calculator with multiple
frequencies<00:00:14.059> in<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.360> case<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:16.020> will<00:00:16.139> find

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
frequencies in this case you will find

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.439 
frequencies in this case you will find
other<00:00:16.650> types<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.250> sharp<00:00:17.490> calculators<00:00:18.090> for

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
other types of sharp calculators for

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.349 
other types of sharp calculators for
instance<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.789> or<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.240> them

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
instance this one or this one of them

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
instance this one or this one of them
they<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:21.990> operate<00:00:22.260> exactly<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.130> same<00:00:23.340> way

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
they all operate exactly the same way

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.259 
they all operate exactly the same way
they<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.449> different

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
they just look a little bit different

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.700 
they just look a little bit different
first<00:00:27.269> thing<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:27.840> into<00:00:28.019> statistics

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
first thing is to get into statistics

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.770 
first thing is to get into statistics
mode<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.369> calculator<00:00:29.869> press<00:00:30.869> mode

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
mode on your calculator press mode

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.250 
mode on your calculator press mode
statistics<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.610> we<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.910> SD<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.960> standard

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
statistics one we want SD for standard

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.580 
statistics one we want SD for standard
deviation<00:00:38.750> once<00:00:39.750> you're<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.079> mode<00:00:40.320> we

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
deviation once you're in this mode we

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.010 
deviation once you're in this mode we
can<00:00:40.860> enter<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.460> our<00:00:41.579> data<00:00:41.790> table<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
can enter in our data table for this

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.920 
can enter in our data table for this
case<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.100> score<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.789> our<00:00:45.360> frequency

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
case this is our score and our frequency

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.900 
case this is our score and our frequency
so<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.710> three<00:00:46.950> different<00:00:47.070> scores<00:00:47.520> five

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so we have three different scores five

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.310 
so we have three different scores five
six<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> seven<00:00:48.510> three<00:00:49.350> classes<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.700> five

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
six and seven three classes but five

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.549 
six and seven three classes but five
because<00:00:52.320> four<00:00:52.680> times<00:00:53.059> six

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
because four times six

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
because four times six
because<00:00:55.559> eight<00:00:55.860> times<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> seven<00:00:57.300> occurs

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
because eight times and seven occurs

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
because eight times and seven occurs
eight<00:00:58.079> times<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:59.090> total<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> 20<00:01:00.480> frequencies<00:01:01.520> so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
eight times a total of 20 frequencies so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.299 
eight times a total of 20 frequencies so
let's<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.270> started

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
let's get started

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.350 
let's get started
five<00:01:06.590> underneath<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.400> store<00:01:08.790> button<00:01:09.090> you'll

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
five underneath the store button you'll

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.830 
five underneath the store button you'll
see<00:01:09.450> X<00:01:09.840> dash<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:11.220> X<00:01:11.610> comma<00:01:11.850> Y<00:01:14.390> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.600> for

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
see X dash or X comma Y this is for

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.910 
see X dash or X comma Y this is for
score<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.049> frequency<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> five<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
score and then the frequency so five is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.609 
score and then the frequency so five is
our<00:01:23.070> school<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> comma<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> then

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
our school into that comma and then

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.899 
our school into that comma and then
we're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> say<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.310> many<00:01:26.369> times<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
we're going to say how many times it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
we're going to say how many times it
occurs<00:01:27.350> four<00:01:28.350> times<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.610> M<00:01:29.790> plus<00:01:31.009> data

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
occurs four times and then M plus data

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.350 
occurs four times and then M plus data
set<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.400> saying<00:01:32.579> we've<00:01:32.729> been<00:01:32.850> setting<00:01:33.090> one

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
set is saying we've been setting one

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.890 
set is saying we've been setting one
type<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> data<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.009> individual<00:01:35.900> second

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
type of data not one individual second

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.880 
type of data not one individual second
one<00:01:37.070> six<00:01:38.360> occurs<00:01:39.770> eight<00:01:40.770> times<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.000> time<00:01:42.899> two

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
one six occurs eight times in time two

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.850 
one six occurs eight times in time two
sets<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.579> data<00:01:44.729> enter<00:01:45.979> seven<00:01:47.360> occurs<00:01:48.860> eight

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
sets of data enter seven occurs eight

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.539 
sets of data enter seven occurs eight
times<00:01:50.280> M<00:01:51.210> plus<00:01:51.680> three<00:01:52.680> sets<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> data<00:01:53.130> entered

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
times M plus three sets of data entered

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
times M plus three sets of data entered
in<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:55.110> check<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.740> actually<00:01:56.040> have

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
in to now check that we actually have

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
in to now check that we actually have
the<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:56.460> frequencies<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> want

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the right frequencies in what you want

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.910 
the right frequencies in what you want
to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.729> down<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.270> N<00:02:00.930> button<00:02:01.500> here

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to do is go down to the N button here

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
to do is go down to the N button here
above<00:02:02.399> your<00:02:02.640> zero<00:02:02.909> access<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.140> using<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
above your zero access that using the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.850 
above your zero access that using the
alpha<00:02:05.750> zero<00:02:06.750> n<00:02:08.330> equals<00:02:09.330> twenty<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.709> have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
alpha zero n equals twenty so we have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.750 
alpha zero n equals twenty so we have
the<00:02:10.950> right<00:02:11.129> amount<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.430> data<00:02:11.640> entered<00:02:12.030> in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
the right amount of data entered in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.100 
the right amount of data entered in
first<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.510> all<00:02:13.629> we're<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.900> look<00:02:14.019> at

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
first of all we're going to look at

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.710 
first of all we're going to look at
finding<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.530> average<00:02:15.269> average<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.540> x-bar<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
finding the average average is x-bar the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.080 
finding the average average is x-bar the
mean<00:02:19.930> which<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.890> found<00:02:21.129> above<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.640> number<00:02:21.760> 4

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
mean which is found above the number 4

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.670 
mean which is found above the number 4
so<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.209> want<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> press<00:02:25.629> alpha<00:02:25.900> first<00:02:26.170> because

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
so we want to press alpha first because

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.759 
so we want to press alpha first because
it's<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:26.980> green<00:02:27.540> 4<00:02:29.040> equals<00:02:32.879> 6.2<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:35.379> next<00:02:35.650> one

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it's in green 4 equals 6.2 the next one

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.199 
it's in green 4 equals 6.2 the next one
we're<00:02:35.890> going<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.040> look<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.849> standard

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
we're going to look for is the standard

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.580 
we're going to look for is the standard
deviation<00:02:37.890> Sigma<00:02:38.910> X<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:44.140> measures<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
deviation Sigma X this measures the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.710 
deviation Sigma X this measures the
spread<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.220> data<00:02:45.400> from<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:47.349> average

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
spread of the data from the average
