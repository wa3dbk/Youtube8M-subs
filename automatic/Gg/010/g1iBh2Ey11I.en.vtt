00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
instead just leaving it as is which is a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.470 
instead just leaving it as is which is a
good<00:04:05.109> idea<00:04:05.169> but<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.609> way<00:04:06.639> you<00:04:06.790> did<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.150> he<00:04:07.329> was

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
good idea but the way you did it he was

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.599 
good idea but the way you did it he was
he<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:07.959> grabbed<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.650> with<00:04:09.099> his<00:04:09.160> hand<00:04:09.280> and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
he just grabbed it with his hand and

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.909 
he just grabbed it with his hand and
just<00:04:09.730> squeeze<00:04:10.389> this<00:04:10.750> living<00:04:11.109> shove<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.799> it

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
just squeeze this living shove it and it

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.129 
just squeeze this living shove it and it

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
that we did like to it either and so we

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.980 
that we did like to it either and so we
ordered<00:05:25.190> these<00:05:25.400> tutor<00:05:25.790> rules<00:05:28.780> but<00:05:29.780> we<00:05:29.870> were
