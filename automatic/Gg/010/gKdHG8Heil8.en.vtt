00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
producing baits that had different sink

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.119 
producing baits that had different sink
rates<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.930> wanted<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> bait<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.800> just

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
rates so if you wanted a bait that just

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
rates so if you wanted a bait that just
barely<00:00:47.460> swam<00:00:47.940> below<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> surface

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
barely swam below the surface

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.110 
barely swam below the surface
you<00:00:49.320> had<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.430> had<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.820> where<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> were

you had it if you had one where you were

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.049 
you had it if you had one where you were
trying<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> fish<00:00:51.719> 50<00:00:52.289> feet<00:00:52.530> deep<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.550> had<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
trying to fish 50 feet deep you had that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
trying to fish 50 feet deep you had that
I<00:00:54.270> mean<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> bait<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.530> everything

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
some of those sink rates work so first I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
some of those sink rates work so first I
wanted<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> start<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> Huddleston<00:01:04.110> most

is rate of fall you have an ro f0 in

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
is rate of fall you have an ro f0 in

point<00:02:37.379> on<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.739> belly<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.659> don't

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
point on the belly but I really don't

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.559 
point on the belly but I really don't
like<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.439> do<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.939> over<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.060> years<00:02:42.329> I've

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
like to do that over the years I've

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.539 
like to do that over the years I've
talked<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.019> lot<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.950> don't<00:02:44.370> like

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
talked a lot about how I don't like

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.280 
talked a lot about how I don't like
putting<00:02:44.849> hooks<00:02:45.299> on<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.659> bellies<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
putting hooks on the bellies of the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.289 
putting hooks on the bellies of the
baits<00:02:46.470> because<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.489> hook<00:02:47.700> fish<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
baits because you can hook fish in the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.440 
baits because you can hook fish in the
gills<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.010> damage<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.790> my

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
gills and do a lot of damage so my

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.229 
gills and do a lot of damage so my
choice<00:02:51.780> instead<00:02:52.109> is<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:53.250> put<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.609> hook<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:53.940> top

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
choice instead is to put the hook on top

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.289 
choice instead is to put the hook on top
I<00:02:54.629> use<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> pretty<00:02:55.920> small<00:02:56.340> look<00:02:56.609> on<00:02:56.849> these<00:02:57.030> baits

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
I use a pretty small look on these baits

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.509 
I use a pretty small look on these baits
I'm<00:02:58.139> not<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.650> into<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.889> details<00:02:59.310> of

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
I'm not going to go into the details of

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.970 
I'm not going to go into the details of
how<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.790> attach<00:03:00.269> them<00:03:00.599> I<00:03:00.810> might<00:03:01.439> do<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.920> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
how to attach them I might do that in a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
how to attach them I might do that in a
future<00:03:02.250> video<00:03:02.579> I<00:03:02.819> know<00:03:02.970> we've<00:03:03.180> done<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.629> on

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
future video I know we've done one on

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.080 
future video I know we've done one on
that<00:03:03.989> before<00:03:04.409> but<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.459> are<00:03:05.579> three<00:03:05.879> or<00:03:06.060> four

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
that before but there are three or four

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.569 
that before but there are three or four
different<00:03:06.359> good<00:03:07.290> options<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.189> attaching

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
different good options for attaching

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.970 
different good options for attaching
your<00:03:09.000> hooks<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.750> bait<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.799> just

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
your hooks to the bait but you just

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.679 
your hooks to the bait but you just
attach<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.700> bait<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.060> stick<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.569> into

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
attach it to the bait and stick it into

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.839 
attach it to the bait and stick it into
the<00:03:12.840> back<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.010> important<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.549> fish

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
the back and it's so important to fish

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.800 
the back and it's so important to fish
that<00:03:15.090> hook<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.540> top<00:03:16.639> because<00:03:17.639> then<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.329> if<00:03:18.629> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that hook on top because then you if the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.110 
that hook on top because then you if the
fish<00:03:19.019> comes<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.620> eats<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:20.099> bait<00:03:20.310> they're

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
fish comes up and eats the bait they're

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.819 
fish comes up and eats the bait they're
a<00:03:21.150> lot<00:03:21.480> less<00:03:21.660> likely<00:03:22.139> for<00:03:22.169> that<00:03:22.440> bait<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.739> get

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
a lot less likely for that bait to get

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.680 
a lot less likely for that bait to get
turned<00:03:23.129> upside<00:03:23.489> down<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.910> get<00:03:24.150> those<00:03:24.359> hooks

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
turned upside down and get those hooks

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.409 
turned upside down and get those hooks
in<00:03:24.930> their<00:03:25.139> gills<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> much

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
in their gills so you just have a much

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.990 
in their gills so you just have a much
higher<00:03:27.900> chance<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:28.980> hurting<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.760> fish

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
higher chance of not hurting the fish

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.809 
higher chance of not hurting the fish
and<00:03:30.449> releasing<00:03:31.109> them<00:03:31.230> successfully<00:03:32.099> now

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
and releasing them successfully now

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.670 
and releasing them successfully now
other<00:03:33.090> companies<00:03:33.690> are<00:03:33.870> doing<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.199> same<00:03:34.409> thing

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
other companies are doing the same thing

other companies are doing the same thing

and<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:41.129> fat<00:03:41.430> sink<00:03:41.879> but<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.959> wanted<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.500> put

and a fat sink but if you wanted to put

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.610

a<00:03:43.769> rate<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.430> fall<00:03:44.819> rating<00:03:45.329> on<00:03:45.479> that<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.229> slow

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
a rate of fall rating on that the slow

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.680 
a rate of fall rating on that the slow
sink<00:03:46.979> is<00:03:47.129> about<00:03:47.370> an<00:03:47.519> R<00:03:47.760> of9

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
sink is about an R of9

I believe it's like a 17 or 18 somewhere
around<00:03:55.889> there<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.180> pretty<00:03:57.389> fast<00:03:57.720> sinking

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
around there it's a pretty fast sinking
