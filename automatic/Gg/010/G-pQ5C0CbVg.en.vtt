00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
new toys for us what you got can't do so

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.350 
new toys for us what you got can't do so
I<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.769> two<00:00:14.070> new<00:00:14.370> cameras<00:00:14.820> as<00:00:15.030> three<00:00:15.240> new

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
I have two new cameras as three new

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.720 
I have two new cameras as three new
lenses<00:00:15.719> okay<00:00:16.080> today<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:17.190> gonna<00:00:17.310> start<00:00:17.580> off

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
lenses okay today I'm gonna start off

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.330 
lenses okay today I'm gonna start off
with<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.480> new<00:00:18.660> three<00:00:19.080> end<00:00:19.320> okay<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.800> NEX

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
with the the new three end okay the NEX

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.810 
with the the new three end okay the NEX
three<00:00:20.640> n<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.720> replaces<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.500> any<00:00:22.650> xf3<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.580> if

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
three n it replaces at any xf3 and if

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.640 
three n it replaces at any xf3 and if
you<00:00:23.939> remember<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.439> an

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
you remember you know it's an

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.259 
you remember you know it's an
interchangeable<00:00:26.099> lens<00:00:26.369> camera<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> has<00:00:27.060> an

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
interchangeable lens camera it has an

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
interchangeable lens camera it has an
aps-c<00:00:27.750> sized<00:00:28.199> sensor<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
aps-c sized sensor in it so it's the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.479 
aps-c sized sensor in it so it's the
same<00:00:29.820> sensor<00:00:30.269> size<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.660> most<00:00:31.199> DSLRs<00:00:31.830> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
same sensor size as most DSLRs this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
same sensor size as most DSLRs this
feels<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.690> smaller<00:00:33.960> than

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
feels like it's like it's smaller than

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.370 
feels like it's like it's smaller than
my<00:00:34.469> than<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.010> seven<00:00:35.370> month<00:00:35.579> old<00:00:35.760> yeah<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.570> did

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
my than my seven month old yeah so I did

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.340 
my than my seven month old yeah so I did
bring<00:00:37.649> any<00:00:38.100> xs3<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.879> me<00:00:39.000> today<00:00:39.180> okay<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.690> we

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bring any xs3 with me today okay so we

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.639 
bring any xs3 with me today okay so we
can<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.770> size<00:00:41.010> comparisons<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.649> inside

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
can do some size comparisons here inside

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
can do some size comparisons here inside
the<00:00:43.950> NEX<00:00:44.250> three<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.850> still<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> same

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the NEX three and we still have the same

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830 
the NEX three and we still have the same
16<00:00:46.020> megapixel<00:00:46.559> image<00:00:46.829> sensor<00:00:47.210> max<00:00:48.210> ISO

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
16 megapixel image sensor max ISO

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
16 megapixel image sensor max ISO
sensitivity<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.559> sixteen<00:00:49.860> thousand<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.340> those

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
sensitivity is sixteen thousand so those

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
sensitivity is sixteen thousand so those
are<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:51.030> okay<00:00:51.449> what's<00:00:51.660> different

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
are the same okay what's different

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.819 
are the same okay what's different
inside<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.190> brains<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> new

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
inside is the brains so we have a new

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.000 
inside is the brains so we have a new
algorithm<00:00:56.899> area<00:00:57.899> specific<00:00:58.410> noise<00:00:58.649> reduction

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
algorithm area specific noise reduction

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.200 
algorithm area specific noise reduction
what<00:00:59.670> does<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> mean

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
what does that mean

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
what does that mean
so<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.600> borrowed<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> 99<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so that's borrowed from the a 99 it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
so that's borrowed from the a 99 it's
very<00:01:02.820> intelligent<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:04.260> only<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.799> doing

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
very intelligent so not only is it doing

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
very intelligent so not only is it doing
those<00:01:05.280> reduction<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.360> entire<00:01:06.780> image<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
those reduction on the entire image so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.780 
those reduction on the entire image so
this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> something<00:01:07.860> we're<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> see

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
this is something we're like if you see

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.120 
this is something we're like if you see
if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> picture<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.500> sky

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
if you have a picture that's like a sky

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
if you have a picture that's like a sky
with<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> nice<00:01:11.610> sunset<00:01:11.909> gradient<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.720> then

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
with a nice sunset gradient and then

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
with a nice sunset gradient and then
like<00:01:13.049> something<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> texture<00:01:14.010> yeah<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.880> if

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
like something with a texture yeah so if

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
like something with a texture yeah so if
you<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> tree<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:16.860> want

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you have a tree you know you don't want

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
you have a tree you know you don't want
that<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> same<00:01:18.090> noise<00:01:18.450> reduction

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that to have the same noise reduction

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.859 
that to have the same noise reduction
algorithm<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.040> sky<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.759> it'll<00:01:21.360> keep<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
algorithm as the sky so it'll keep the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
algorithm as the sky so it'll keep the
tree<00:01:22.229> sharp<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.860> keep<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> let<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> sky<00:01:24.479> nice

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
tree sharp but keep the let the sky nice

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
tree sharp but keep the let the sky nice
and<00:01:25.140> continuous<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.710> color<00:01:25.890> very<00:01:26.310> cool<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and continuous in color very cool so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
and continuous in color very cool so
that<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.270> improves<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:28.049> imagine<00:01:28.200> all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that that improves I would imagine all

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990 
that that improves I would imagine all
kinds<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.009> edges<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.579> things<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
kinds of like edges and things like that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
kinds of like edges and things like that
oh<00:01:30.270> yeah<00:01:30.540> nice<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.979> good

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
oh yeah nice that's a really good

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.130 
oh yeah nice that's a really good
improvement<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.360> another<00:01:33.720> area<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
improvement there so another area that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
improvement there so another area that
we<00:01:34.380> improve<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.890> auto<00:01:35.130> portrait<00:01:35.579> framing

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we improve this auto portrait framing

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.929 
we improve this auto portrait framing
before<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> NEX<00:01:37.259> f3<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.040> only<00:01:38.189> were<00:01:38.670> able

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
before on the NEX f3 we only were able

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.539 
before on the NEX f3 we only were able
to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.540> face<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.619> person<00:01:41.009> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to do it on one face so one person in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.330 
to do it on one face so one person in
that<00:01:41.579> image<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.829> what<00:01:43.829> happens<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that image but now what happens if you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.710 
that image but now what happens if you
have<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.610> two<00:01:44.729> people<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.479> dropping

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
have like two people just like dropping

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.889 
have like two people just like dropping
so<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.770> heard<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.700> complain<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> we

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
so we heard that complain a lot and we

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719 
so we heard that complain a lot and we
improve<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.130> camera<00:01:50.399> can

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
improve this so now this camera can

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.980 
improve this so now this camera can
intelligently<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.770> two<00:01:52.979> people<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.990> very

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
intelligently on see two people and very

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.999 
intelligently on see two people and very
cool<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.590> um

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
cool and then um

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.889 
cool and then um
also<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.579> top<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.270> were<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.840> know

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
also on top it out we were like you know

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.590 
also on top it out we were like you know
why<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.409> further<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.579> Auto<00:01:59.969> Mac

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
why not go further so we have Auto Mac

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
why not go further so we have Auto Mac
framing<00:02:01.079> okay<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.189> shooting<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
framing okay so if you're shooting a

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.300 
framing okay so if you're shooting a
macro<00:02:02.909> image<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> flower<00:02:03.930> it'll<00:02:04.710> use<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
macro image like a flower it'll use that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
macro image like a flower it'll use that
same<00:02:05.579> sort<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.149> rule<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.479> third<00:02:06.719> rule<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.590> make

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
same sort of rule of third rule and make

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.859 
same sort of rule of third rule and make
a<00:02:07.829> better<00:02:08.069> composition<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.970> yet<00:02:09.360> there's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
a better composition and yet there's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.520 
a better composition and yet there's
another<00:02:09.989> feature<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.860> we

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
another feature that we

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.710 
another feature that we
it's<00:02:12.100> called<00:02:12.310> auto<00:02:12.610> tracking<00:02:12.970> framing<00:02:13.540> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it's called auto tracking framing and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.320 
it's called auto tracking framing and
the<00:02:14.380> camera<00:02:14.740> knows<00:02:15.130> now<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:16.210> you're

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the camera knows now that if you're

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.510 
the camera knows now that if you're
tracking<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.870> subject<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.100> moving<00:02:18.310> in

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
tracking a subject and it's moving in

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.120 
tracking a subject and it's moving in
one<00:02:18.700> direction<00:02:18.910> it'll<00:02:19.750> take<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:20.860> original

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
one direction it'll take that original

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.730 
one direction it'll take that original
picture<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.820> crop<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.590> a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
picture and crop it so that it's a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.130 
picture and crop it so that it's a
better<00:02:23.950> composition<00:02:24.400> leaving<00:02:25.390> more<00:02:25.630> space<00:02:25.660> in

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
better composition leaving more space in

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.830 
better composition leaving more space in
in<00:02:26.500> front<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.430> object<00:02:27.940> that's<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
in front of the object that's in the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.960 
in front of the object that's in the
moving<00:02:29.140> direction<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.920> mean<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.640> addition

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
moving direction so I mean in addition

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.180 
moving direction so I mean in addition
to<00:02:31.060> being<00:02:31.320> smaller<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.440> mean<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.800> feels<00:02:32.950> like

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
to being smaller I mean this feels like

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.520 
to being smaller I mean this feels like
it's<00:02:33.370> really<00:02:33.700> small<00:02:34.000> really<00:02:34.410> what<00:02:35.410> other

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it's really small really what other

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.810 
it's really small really what other
physical<00:02:35.920> differences<00:02:36.280> are<00:02:36.430> we<00:02:36.520> seeing<00:02:36.670> here

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
physical differences are we seeing here

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.820 
physical differences are we seeing here
I'm<00:02:37.240> gonna<00:02:37.420> go<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.959> similarities<00:02:38.560> first

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
I'm gonna go from the similarities first

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.630 
I'm gonna go from the similarities first
then<00:02:39.730> xs3<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.959> tilting<00:02:41.470> 180<00:02:42.070> degrees<00:02:42.459> and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
then xs3 the tilting 180 degrees and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.460 
then xs3 the tilting 180 degrees and
screen<00:02:43.060> wasn't<00:02:43.390> very<00:02:43.510> popular<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.080> we<00:02:44.200> kept

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
screen wasn't very popular so we kept

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.190 
screen wasn't very popular so we kept
that<00:02:44.620> cool<00:02:45.330> one<00:02:46.330> different<00:02:46.750> thing<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.110> this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
that cool one different thing and this

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.610 
that cool one different thing and this
is<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.410> first<00:02:47.739> for<00:02:47.860> any<00:02:48.640> X<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:50.170> zoom<00:02:50.440> lever

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
is a first for any X is the zoom lever

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.400 
is a first for any X is the zoom lever
here<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.670> electronical<00:02:52.360> zoom<00:02:53.140> lever

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
here so it's a electronical zoom lever

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.070 
here so it's a electronical zoom lever
and<00:02:53.650> then<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.580> zoom<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.300> out<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
and then you can zoom in and out and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.020 
and then you can zoom in and out and
it's<00:02:56.290> positioned<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.400> if<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.790> ever

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
it's positioned like this so if you ever

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.330 
it's positioned like this so if you ever
do<00:02:58.560> self-portraits<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.739> can<00:02:59.890> actually<00:03:00.310> zoom

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
do self-portraits you can actually zoom

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.510 
do self-portraits you can actually zoom
not<00:03:01.120> easily<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.770> like<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.280> it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
not easily like that I like that it

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.640 
not easily like that I like that it
still<00:03:03.700> has<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> flash<00:03:04.600> pop-up<00:03:05.050> flash<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.470> well

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
still has a flash pop-up flash as well

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.150 
still has a flash pop-up flash as well
so<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:06.820> really<00:03:07.140> but<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:09.040> can

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
so it's just like really but it you can

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.000 
so it's just like really but it you can
see<00:03:09.459> here<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.000> height<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.480> reduced<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.590> lot<00:03:11.770> and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
see here the height is reduced a lot and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.880 
see here the height is reduced a lot and
that's<00:03:12.130> thanks<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.780> lens<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.290> it's<00:03:14.709> a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
that's thanks to the lens here it's a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.220 
that's thanks to the lens here it's a
collapsible<00:03:15.370> lens<00:03:15.880> one<00:03:16.720> thing<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.080> have

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
collapsible lens one thing that I have

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.130 
collapsible lens one thing that I have
forgot<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.590> mention<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.940> also<00:03:19.239> has<00:03:19.660> a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
forgot to mention is that it also has a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.490 
forgot to mention is that it also has a
zoom<00:03:20.680> lever<00:03:21.640> here<00:03:22.090> oh<00:03:22.239> that's<00:03:22.959> convenient

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
zoom lever here oh that's convenient

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.220 
zoom lever here oh that's convenient
but<00:03:23.709> yeah<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.340> if<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.450> zoom

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
but yeah if if you don't like that zoom

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.050 
but yeah if if you don't like that zoom
lever<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.799> can<00:03:26.920> always<00:03:27.160> use<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.700> zoom<00:03:27.910> ring

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
lever you can always use the zoom ring

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.630 
lever you can always use the zoom ring
here<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.709> actually<00:03:30.040> three<00:03:30.190> controls

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
here so you have actually three controls

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.910 
here so you have actually three controls
for<00:03:30.850> zoom<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.570> ringing<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.170> lever<00:03:32.350> here<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
for zoom the ringing the lever here and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.640 
for zoom the ringing the lever here and
the<00:03:33.070> lever<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.700> well<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.959> an<00:03:35.110> ISO

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
the lever here as well we have an ISO

Wi-Fi in this guy no no there's no Wi-Fi
the<00:03:48.549> NEX<00:03:49.180> f3<00:03:49.630> didn't<00:03:49.930> have<00:03:50.049> Wi-Fi<00:03:50.230> eater<00:03:50.620> if

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
the NEX f3 didn't have Wi-Fi eater if

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.530 
the NEX f3 didn't have Wi-Fi eater if
you<00:03:51.070> want<00:03:51.250> Wi-Fi<00:03:51.579> which<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.000> really<00:03:52.329> cool

black one would have a black picket line

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.780 
black one would have a black picket line
as<00:04:34.240> long<00:04:34.420> nice<00:04:34.690> awesome<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:36.010> that<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.640> new

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
stuff for the NEX line you brought a new

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.190 
stuff for the NEX line you brought a new
alpha<00:04:39.730> with<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.060> well<00:04:40.210> that's<00:04:40.630> great<00:04:40.870> yeah

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
so what I have here is a SLT a 58

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.040 
so what I have here is a SLT a 58
replacing<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.460> 57<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.750> we're<00:04:46.900> really

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
replacing the a 57 and we're really

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.110 
replacing the a 57 and we're really
excited<00:04:47.410> about<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:47.830> model<00:04:48.100> because<00:04:48.550> there's

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
excited about this model because there's

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.490 
excited about this model because there's
a<00:04:49.180> lot<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.480> improvements<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.230> one<00:04:50.380> as

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
a lot of improvements of in this one as

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.980 
a lot of improvements of in this one as
well<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.670> has<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:51.820> completely<00:04:52.390> new<00:04:52.540> sensor

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
well so it has a completely new sensor

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.950 
well so it has a completely new sensor
on<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.770> a57<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.640> had<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.820> 16<00:04:55.240> megapixel<00:04:55.330> image

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
on the a57 it had a 16 megapixel image

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.680 
on the a57 it had a 16 megapixel image
sensor<00:04:55.990> but<00:04:56.500> now<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.220> 58<00:04:57.520> we<00:04:58.090> have<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.300> 20<00:04:58.630> mm

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
sensor but now on the 58 we have a 20 mm

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.720 
sensor but now on the 58 we have a 20 mm
megapixel<00:04:59.530> image<00:04:59.770> sensor<00:04:59.800> okay<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:00.400> that's<00:05:00.640> a

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
megapixel image sensor okay so that's a

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.330 
megapixel image sensor okay so that's a
jump<00:05:00.940> hell<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.750> then<00:05:01.960> max<00:05:02.440> ISO<00:05:03.010> sensitivity

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
jump hell and then max ISO sensitivity

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.210 
jump hell and then max ISO sensitivity
is<00:05:03.910> 16,000<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.200> different<00:05:05.470> than<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.650> 57

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
is 16,000 is that different than the 57

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.310 
is 16,000 is that different than the 57
that's<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.700> same<00:05:06.910> okay<00:05:07.270> very<00:05:07.870> good<00:05:07.960> in<00:05:08.200> low

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
that's the same okay very good in low

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.340 
that's the same okay very good in low
light<00:05:08.530> but<00:05:09.240> also<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.540> brains<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:11.050> beyonds

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
light but also the brains the beyonds

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.410 
light but also the brains the beyonds
processor<00:05:11.890> that's<00:05:12.190> changed<00:05:12.700> as<00:05:12.850> well<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.390> I

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
processor that's changed as well so I

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.750 
processor that's changed as well so I
talked<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.810> little<00:05:13.960> bit<00:05:14.200> area<00:05:15.160> specific<00:05:15.670> noise

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
talked a little bit area specific noise

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.330 
talked a little bit area specific noise
reduction<00:05:16.090> that's<00:05:16.780> also<00:05:17.140> in<00:05:17.350> here<00:05:17.710> borrowed

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
reduction that's also in here borrowed

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.060 
reduction that's also in here borrowed
from<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.670> a<00:05:18.700> 99<00:05:19.360> cool<00:05:19.810> we<00:05:20.320> also<00:05:20.500> have<00:05:20.890> an

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
from the a 99 cool we also have an

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.570 
from the a 99 cool we also have an
improvement<00:05:21.400> in<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.790> PDF<00:05:22.330> as<00:05:22.630> well<00:05:22.890> in<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:24.070> 57

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
improvement in the PDF as well in the 57

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.440 
improvement in the PDF as well in the 57
that<00:05:24.700> was<00:05:24.790> LCD<00:05:25.210> now<00:05:25.510> we<00:05:25.570> get<00:05:25.780> ola<00:05:26.230> yeah<00:05:26.890> I<00:05:27.520> like

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
that was LCD now we get ola yeah I like

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.540 
that was LCD now we get ola yeah I like
that<00:05:28.600> that<00:05:28.750> led<00:05:29.200> you<00:05:29.560> finder<00:05:29.920> is<00:05:30.010> like<00:05:30.220> working

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
that that led you finder is like working

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.310 
that that led you finder is like working
its<00:05:30.670> way<00:05:30.850> oh<00:05:31.180> yeah<00:05:31.480> cross<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.870> line<00:05:32.050> so

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
its way oh yeah cross the line so

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.960 
its way oh yeah cross the line so
another<00:05:32.830> improvement<00:05:33.190> that<00:05:33.460> we<00:05:33.610> made<00:05:33.790> on<00:05:33.940> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
another improvement that we made on the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.560 
another improvement that we made on the
850<00:05:34.480> is<00:05:34.720> lock-on<00:05:35.230> AF<00:05:35.440> so<00:05:36.280> does<00:05:36.520> that<00:05:36.670> help<00:05:36.910> so

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
850 is lock-on AF so does that help so

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.260 
850 is lock-on AF so does that help so
that<00:05:37.930> helps<00:05:38.320> because<00:05:38.710> there's<00:05:39.430> only<00:05:39.640> 15

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
that helps because there's only 15

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.970 
that helps because there's only 15
points<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.750> Asia<00:05:40.900> which<00:05:41.320> is<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.500> lot<00:05:41.740> for

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
points of Asia which is a lot for

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.280 
points of Asia which is a lot for
entry-level<00:05:42.370> cameras<00:05:43.150> but<00:05:43.360> because<00:05:44.110> there's

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
entry-level cameras but because there's

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.650 
entry-level cameras but because there's
only<00:05:44.440> 15<00:05:44.890> points<00:05:45.040> in<00:05:45.190> AF<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:46.030> are<00:05:46.120> limited<00:05:46.540> in

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
only 15 points in AF you are limited in

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.020 
only 15 points in AF you are limited in
the<00:05:46.810> center<00:05:47.110> but<00:05:47.410> if<00:05:47.890> that<00:05:48.160> if<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.700> camera<00:05:49.000> is

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
the center but if that if the camera is

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.760 
the center but if that if the camera is
intelligent<00:05:49.690> enough<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:49.930> recognize<00:05:50.560> that

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
intelligent enough to recognize that

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.950 
intelligent enough to recognize that
there's<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.070> big<00:05:51.340> or<00:05:51.550> object<00:05:52.000> then<00:05:52.390> if<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:52.780> go

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
there's a big or object then if you go

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.290 
there's a big or object then if you go
off<00:05:53.200> to<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.590> screen<00:05:53.890> a<00:05:53.920> little<00:05:54.160> bit<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.760> will

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
off to the screen a little bit it will

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.030 
off to the screen a little bit it will
still<00:05:55.540> recognize<00:05:55.930> that<00:05:56.170> it<00:05:56.410> needs<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.680> focus

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
still recognize that it needs to focus

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.130 
still recognize that it needs to focus
on<00:05:57.190> you<00:05:57.340> okay<00:05:57.730> so<00:05:57.790> you<00:05:58.150> move<00:05:58.330> out<00:05:58.540> of<00:05:58.570> that<00:05:58.810> AF

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
on you okay so you move out of that AF

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.750 
on you okay so you move out of that AF
area<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.650> then<00:05:59.770> back<00:05:59.980> into<00:06:00.220> it<00:06:00.370> it's<00:06:00.490> like<00:06:00.610> oh

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
area and then back into it it's like oh

18<00:06:42.889> to<00:06:43.070> 55<00:06:43.550> mark<00:06:43.970> 2<00:06:44.240> version<00:06:44.780> ok<00:06:45.139> and<00:06:45.290> what<00:06:45.410> are

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
18 to 55 mark 2 version ok and what are

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.659 
18 to 55 mark 2 version ok and what are
the<00:06:45.560> differences<00:06:45.919> between<00:06:45.980> the<00:06:46.280> mark<00:06:46.430> 1<00:06:46.580> of

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
the differences between the mark 1 of

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.490 
the differences between the mark 1 of
the<00:06:46.730> market<00:06:47.030> or<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.389> cosmetically<00:06:47.960> it's<00:06:48.440> a

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
the market or the cosmetically it's a

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.659 
the market or the cosmetically it's a
little<00:06:48.680> bit<00:06:48.770> different<00:06:49.070> we<00:06:49.130> have<00:06:49.250> on<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:49.490> top

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
little bit different we have on the top

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.960 
little bit different we have on the top
screen<00:06:50.030> also<00:06:50.750> on<00:06:51.200> the<00:06:51.380> rear<00:06:51.770> element<00:06:52.520> that

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
screen also on the rear element that

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.270 
screen also on the rear element that
shades<00:06:53.419> that<00:06:53.750> lens<00:06:54.020> as<00:06:54.200> well<00:06:54.380> it's<00:06:54.889> a<00:06:55.070> little

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
shades that lens as well it's a little

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.100 
shades that lens as well it's a little
bit<00:06:55.370> better<00:06:55.490> so<00:06:55.850> there's<00:06:56.300> less<00:06:56.660> internal

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
bit better so there's less internal

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.960
