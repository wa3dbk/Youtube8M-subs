Hey well now I'd like to show you this
what<00:02:12.739> then<00:02:12.920> appeared<00:02:13.310> was<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:15.799> so<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.159> is<00:02:16.220> it

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
what then appeared was it so this is it

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.360 
what then appeared was it so this is it
this<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.569> no<00:02:17.930> ordinary<00:02:18.049> suitcase<00:02:18.769> isn't<00:02:19.280> it

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
this is no ordinary suitcase isn't it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.009

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.679 
osmosis membranes I had together dozens
of<00:05:42.930> them<00:05:43.110> still<00:05:43.949> no<00:05:44.129> success<00:05:44.610> then<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.389> tried

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
of them still no success then I tried

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.050 
of them still no success then I tried
with<00:05:45.870> another<00:05:46.199> and<00:05:46.500> another<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.669> still

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
with another and another but I still

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.769 
with another and another but I still
couldn't<00:05:48.330> make<00:05:48.449> it<00:05:48.569> work<00:05:50.330> after<00:05:51.330> countless

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
couldn't make it work after countless

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.499 
couldn't make it work after countless
attempts<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.889> takumi<00:05:53.340> had<00:05:53.490> another<00:05:54.029> idea<00:05:54.150> oh

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
attempts the takumi had another idea oh

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:03.159 
attempts the takumi had another idea oh
of<00:05:57.509> course<00:05:57.599> that's<00:05:58.199> it

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.049 

toxic<00:06:04.169> materials<00:06:04.739> passed<00:06:05.189> through<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.789> pores

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:06.059 
toxic materials passed through the pores

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.299 
toxic materials passed through the pores
because<00:06:06.449> they<00:06:06.629> were<00:06:06.689> so<00:06:06.929> small<00:06:06.959> the<00:06:07.830> Takumi's

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:08.309 
because they were so small the Takumi's

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:10.579 
because they were so small the Takumi's
idea<00:06:08.669> was<00:06:08.939> to<00:06:09.149> bunch<00:06:09.479> them<00:06:09.629> together<00:06:09.899> to<00:06:10.559> make

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589 
idea was to bunch them together to make

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.889 
idea was to bunch them together to make
a<00:06:10.739> bigger<00:06:11.129> mess<00:06:11.279> so<00:06:11.939> the<00:06:12.119> filter<00:06:12.509> would<00:06:12.629> then

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:12.899 
a bigger mess so the filter would then

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.639 
a bigger mess so the filter would then
catch<00:06:13.199> them<00:06:13.789> it<00:06:14.789> is<00:06:15.239> the<00:06:15.479> first<00:06:15.809> filter<00:06:16.319> which

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:16.649 
catch them it is the first filter which

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:19.009 
catch them it is the first filter which
carries<00:06:17.129> out<00:06:17.309> that<00:06:17.549> function<00:06:18.119> although<00:06:18.329> the

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:19.019 
carries out that function although the

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:22.369 
carries out that function although the
details<00:06:19.409> are<00:06:19.739> a<00:06:19.769> trade<00:06:20.249> secret<00:06:20.899> the<00:06:21.899> material

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
details are a trade secret the material

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.049 
details are a trade secret the material
that<00:06:22.559> is<00:06:22.679> treated<00:06:23.099> in<00:06:23.189> the<00:06:23.309> first<00:06:23.339> filter

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:24.059 
that is treated in the first filter

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.029 
that is treated in the first filter
passes<00:06:24.329> through<00:06:24.929> the<00:06:25.079> second<00:06:25.469> filter<00:06:25.679> and

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
passes through the second filter and

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.339 
passes through the second filter and
then<00:06:26.519> it<00:06:26.759> is<00:06:26.969> caught<00:06:27.269> by<00:06:27.299> the<00:06:27.629> reverse<00:06:28.139> osmosis

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
then it is caught by the reverse osmosis

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.850 
then it is caught by the reverse osmosis
membrane<00:06:29.249> in<00:06:29.459> the<00:06:29.729> third<00:06:29.969> filter<00:06:30.589> once<00:06:31.589> it<00:06:31.739> has

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
membrane in the third filter once it has

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.949 
membrane in the third filter once it has
passed<00:06:31.889> through<00:06:32.459> this<00:06:32.879> stage<00:06:33.209> it<00:06:33.749> has

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:33.959 
passed through this stage it has

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.059 
passed through this stage it has
produced<00:06:34.199> water<00:06:35.039> with<00:06:35.399> almost<00:06:35.819> no<00:06:36.239> impurities

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069 
produced water with almost no impurities

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:39.829 
produced water with almost no impurities
but<00:06:38.069> it<00:06:38.219> is<00:06:38.369> now<00:06:38.610> known<00:06:38.939> that<00:06:38.969> high<00:06:39.479> purity

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
but it is now known that high purity

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.589 
but it is now known that high purity
water<00:06:40.199> not<00:06:40.829> only<00:06:40.860> actually<00:06:41.610> tastes<00:06:42.149> bad<00:06:42.300> but

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
water not only actually tastes bad but

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.679 
water not only actually tastes bad but
it<00:06:43.050> is<00:06:43.199> also<00:06:43.469> not<00:06:43.829> good<00:06:44.099> for<00:06:44.309> your<00:06:44.399> health

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
it is also not good for your health

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.540 
it is also not good for your health
consumed<00:06:45.689> over<00:06:45.899> an<00:06:46.139> extended<00:06:46.619> period<00:06:46.800> of<00:06:47.009> time

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
consumed over an extended period of time

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.329 
consumed over an extended period of time
so<00:06:48.329> the<00:06:48.509> Takumi<00:06:48.869> adds<00:06:49.139> minerals<00:06:49.800> derived<00:06:50.009> from

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:50.339 
so the Takumi adds minerals derived from

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:54.679 
so the Takumi adds minerals derived from
coral<00:06:50.909> at<00:06:51.119> the<00:06:51.419> fourth<00:06:51.719> filter<00:06:52.289> stage<00:06:53.389> in<00:06:54.389> this

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:54.689 
coral at the fourth filter stage in this

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.739 
coral at the fourth filter stage in this
way<00:06:54.959> the<00:06:55.379> Takumi's<00:06:55.889> water<00:06:56.189> purifier<00:06:56.879> is<00:06:57.179> able

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:57.749 
way the Takumi's water purifier is able

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.809 
way the Takumi's water purifier is able
to<00:06:57.839> produce<00:06:58.019> high<00:06:58.649> purity<00:06:59.009> drinking<00:06:59.639> water

00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 
to produce high purity drinking water

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.970 
to produce high purity drinking water
that<00:07:00.089> also<00:07:00.509> tastes<00:07:00.899> good

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
that also tastes good

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.890 
that also tastes good
at<00:07:03.980> the<00:07:04.160> moment<00:07:04.370> we<00:07:04.910> only<00:07:04.940> offer<00:07:05.450> premium

at the moment we only offer premium
water<00:07:06.380> purifying<00:07:07.040> devices<00:07:08.560> so<00:07:09.560> now<00:07:09.860> I<00:07:09.890> would

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
water purifying devices so now I would

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.310 
water purifying devices so now I would
like<00:07:10.490> to<00:07:10.550> produce<00:07:10.850> more<00:07:11.390> reasonably<00:07:11.930> priced

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
like to produce more reasonably priced

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.410 
like to produce more reasonably priced
models<00:07:14.800> I'm<00:07:15.800> also<00:07:16.070> working<00:07:16.520> on<00:07:16.790> a<00:07:16.850> new<00:07:17.120> water

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
models I'm also working on a new water

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.780 
models I'm also working on a new water
purifier<00:07:18.050> that<00:07:18.380> will<00:07:18.770> reproduce<00:07:19.160> the<00:07:19.490> taste

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
purifier that will reproduce the taste

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.580 
purifier that will reproduce the taste
of<00:07:20.030> different<00:07:20.450> water<00:07:20.660> melons<00:07:21.050> from<00:07:21.410> around

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590
