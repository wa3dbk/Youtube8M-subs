00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
quarters we're seeing the defense that

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.240

gets after it's forcing some turnovers
now<00:00:20.310> really<00:00:20.970> stuff<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> run<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.600> two

nine receptions today that was a rough

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
nine receptions today that was a rough
day<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.650> Brandon<00:01:05.100> Flowers<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.729> he<00:01:05.790> had<00:01:05.880> nine

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
Brandon Flowers do his job do we only

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.649 
Brandon Flowers do his job do we only
see<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> big<00:01:11.610> plays<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> happened<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
see the big plays that happened but I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.670 
see the big plays that happened but I
thought<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:12.900> did<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> great<00:01:13.229> job<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
thought they did a great job of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020 
thought they did a great job of
eliminating<00:01:13.830> Jason<00:01:14.490> Witten<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
eliminating Jason Witten which was a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
eliminating Jason Witten which was a
very<00:01:15.210> big<00:01:15.330> concern<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.780> me<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.500> even

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
very big concern for me and I don't even

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.230 
very big concern for me and I don't even
know<00:01:16.770> Miles<00:01:17.009> Austin<00:01:17.220> suited<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> game

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
know Miles Austin suited up for the game

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.190 
know Miles Austin suited up for the game
today<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.540> thought<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.780> did<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> tremendous

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
today I thought they did a tremendous

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.530 
today I thought they did a tremendous
job<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.860> him<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.549> thought<00:01:20.670> overall<00:01:21.150> very
