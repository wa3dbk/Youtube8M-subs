00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello to all and this is already the third 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.160
 episode devoted my hiking books 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.289
 at gr 470 I am here from 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.759
 monistrol for this new stage 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.559
 patrick hello or am I 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.749
 make today hello well 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.750
 today it's the second throats 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.330
 part with a direct start in the east 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 in the old ally to very gorges 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 cashed is very wild and then you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 will go back up on the front trays 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.800
 to come down to the discovery of the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 new world near chÃ¢teauroux where there 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.539
 I promise you sumptuous landscapes 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.440
 am I going to be so hot 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:40.159
 I'm really afraid to follow it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.159
 party for the hike 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.240
 I turned my back on monistrol 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.980
 start of stage 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.600
 it's a good climb that awaits me for 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.280
 to reach the villages of Fontanes and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.300
 showers years not without having done the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.699
 detour by the small chapel 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.449
 saint-etienne whose isolated position me 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.160
 ask me questions 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.350
 and what can she do here 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.420
 this chapel is probably him 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.119
 remains of a castrale chapel of 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.830
 finally a chapel of the castle that was 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.570
 much reworked since all the more 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.800
 that she burned in the 60s 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.600
 since we at the railway line 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.080
 which just goes below in the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 gorges 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.640
 because at the time there were still 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.630
 steam trains that regularly 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.479
 set fire to the ribs 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 x take the detour through the chapel 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.990
 Saint-Etienne is also and above all 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.369
 to afford a point of view in height on 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.940
 this new face of the gorges of the allier 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:42.710
 we are about to cross the allier 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.270
 find it much further at the end 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.320
 a long descent through the woods 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.240
 and flowering meadows 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.860
 beaten by the wind cap on bridge 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.539
 of alleyras pretty little village 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.740
 tourist that developed around 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.840
 of the railway line the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.979
 crossing not to be confused with 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.520
 Alleyras built on the neighboring heights 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.380
 for the hiker 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.030
 the serious things will resume at 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.780
 beyond vars go I leave bridge 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.950
 of alleyras behind me vabers also 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.860
 placed a good climb waiting for me 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.500
 400 m 2 and nivle soft hoist on the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.049
 heights of this hunk of the ally 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.600
 and dominate the throats again at this 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.760
 gone the slope is supported but the effort 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.769
 is mainly done under wood when 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.510
 the space opens you can see bridge 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.720
 of alleyras in the distance as well as the village 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.549
 of alleyras in the background once 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.440
 drought reaches the path 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.720
 waving from hamlets to village 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.459
 by a nice balcony route and 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 relaxing 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.790
 beyond the broom the velay landscape 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 Volcanic close unfolds 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.190
 announcing the upcoming exit of the gorge 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.750
 to combine it for the moment I left 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.280
 the maynial to join the next 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.200
 village on my road by a new 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.160
 path cleverly traced through 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.590
 the vegetation 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.750
 a secret journey that reaches 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.760
 saint-christophe to combine new example 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 of these typical rural hamlets crossed 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.200
 by the gr 470 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.060
 a little freshness and the opportunity also 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.030
 to escape a few moments to the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.130
 heat the wind that got up refreshed 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.480
 also the temperature 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.910
 a few clouds on the shutter could 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.290
 even announce a thunderstorm tonight it's 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.650
 time for me to start the descent on 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.930
 hat the village of saint-amand where I 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.300
 stop tonight face me on 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.510
 very country-like route spawns a 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.680
 path in the middle of the tall grass 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.140
 well there I come out of a passage a little bit 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.790
 jungle ambience machete without machete 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.070
 like because the two hikes down they 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.489
 walk in Bermuda shorts and I have legs 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.880
 they rustled what's going to scratch 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.800
 horrible on the way some companions 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.660
 unexpected road show sometimes 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.290
 tip of their muzzle 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.080
 then comes the highlight of the day 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.750
 Patrick had no anti this morning 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.070
 sacred panorama the discovery of the basin 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.900
 of chapeauroux and the new world 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.730
 stands out as the high point of this 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.890
 crossing the gorges of the ally a 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.200
 incredible landscape suddenly popped up 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.790
 which I consider as major in 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.340
 the emotion caused by its magnitude and 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.600
 his beauty is strong 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.910
 the allier is joined by the round hat 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.180
 and formidable operician there it is in a 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.919
 landscape impregnated by volcanism 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.600
 came to the east and margeride to the west 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.210
 the next two territories are 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.040
 yet geologically very different 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.180
 I wanted to know why it was 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.990
 the margin is steep or that it is the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.630
 volcanic flap 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.700
 these are rocks that are they are 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.000
 arrived at the molten state the difference 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.470
 major is that the granite the big 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.360
 granite massif of the margeride 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.460
 it took a few million years to get 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.910
 cool down here has cooled very very 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.890
 slowly 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.750
 on the side of the shutter already we have rocks 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.490
 which are metamorphic rocks that 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.400
 then about the same age as the 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.410
 granite of the margeride and over these 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.850
 rocks arrived in a very 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.800
 recent there are over a few million 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.060
 barely years of arrival rocks 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.650
 she too in the split state but arrived 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.900
 directly to the soil surface that are 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.360
 cooled much faster and there 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.030
 above are found both basalts 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.130
 called Hawaiians and then on it 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.200
 after they formed cones that 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.640
 calls Strombolian money profits that 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.990
 I have you on hand I will 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.940
 find a formation I've already seen 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.680
 the previous steps that are these 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.169
 famous basaltic organ it's due to what 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.810
 that then basaltic pride is the 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.990
 front of the volcanic flows the organ 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.590
 it is related to a particularity of basalt 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.310
 melted basalt it cools down to 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.780
 the liquid state 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.190
 and then for a moment he crystallizes the at 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.740
 moment they crystallize who is 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.680
 dilates plain and then he retracts to 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.530
 new and that's what makes us 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.500
 in these formations the cracks of 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.680
 withdrawal that forms that have aspects 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.690
 gives them pentagonal prisms 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.139
 hexagonal heptagon to these effects 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.000
 cooling down as we have the 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.580
 mud that forms cracks when 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.160
 she is confined to perfect dryness 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.479
 good so now I know everything I 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.919
 want to be a pro on reading from 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.919
 dominic mercy landscape 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.960
 we continue our route the road 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.460
 it ends soon after a 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.910
 magnificent rise above the new 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:22.490
 world a great end of esta in a 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:24.349
 exceptional setting and that's it here at 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.060
 wrong that ends this third episode 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.280
 my hiking books devoted oger 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.020
 470 so to be perfectly honest 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.000
 with you I was totally subjugated 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.470
 by this landscape here when arriving in the 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.740
 sector of Chapeauroux and the new 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.360
 world 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.889
 it's really a major place to 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.169
 discover when we go hiking 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.120
 so to do that and know everything about 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.830
 these steps that you saw in this 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.970
 reportage arise 470 I invite you to 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.370
 go to the website of 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.110
 hiking notebooks www.canadiantire.ca is 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.639
 we are in a week 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.560
 for the fourth episode it will happen 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.169
 on another territory always arise 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.000
 470 but in the volcanic Velay here 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.740
 it will be discovered next Tuesday 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.370
 by then very good rendering to all and 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.370
 see you soon 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.300
 sing hot
