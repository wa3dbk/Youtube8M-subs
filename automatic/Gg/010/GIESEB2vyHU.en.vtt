one<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.750> think<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.140> though<00:04:04.410> my<00:04:04.709> notes<00:04:04.950> say<00:04:05.190> it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
one I think it is though my notes say it

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.420 
one I think it is though my notes say it
is<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:06.000> must<00:04:06.209> be<00:04:06.620> all<00:04:07.620> right<00:04:07.860> now<00:04:08.130> we're<00:04:08.310> off
