00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.130
 good to everyone I am arctic and we are here 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.980
 in the new video we are back in 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.780
 another tutorial lately I do not know what I 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.210
 it happens that ideas are happening to me and 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.400
 things to do in the tutorials 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.289
 I have not started with any request yet 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.679
 since, more or less, I have some 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.589
 ideas that I want to do first of all 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.449
 how good today I was working on 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.119
 a project that I have that I do not know if it's going to 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.949
 see the light never but good at least 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.040
 entertains a little the free time that 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.010
 I have in summer and I wanted to do it 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.680
 something to receive a building 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.500
 large or an important area of a 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.480
 city ​​or anything of style 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.670
 similar you already know now as always 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.230
 I put here a picture this kind of 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.350
 statues is what I want to do I want 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.019
 do something similar to these statues that 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.809
 they used to be used in cities 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.649
 ancient old enough to 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:03.429
 receive visitors say to the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.040
 temples or gigantic castles or what 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.700
 that it was but I wanted something more mini 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.909
 craft no longer so to speak 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.090
 Simpler friendlier not so much to give 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.939
 fear but more to welcome 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.399
 a new zone so I've been working 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.560
 a little bit in some models of 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.120
 statues and I think I've managed to give 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.300
 with a pretty good solution 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.340
 here you have it as you see is a character 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.950
 pretty similar to steve that looks like 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.380
 pretty to him with brown clothes for not 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.490
 give him so much hostile aspect 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.950
 to say it seems more like a humble boy 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.780
 so to speak that he has no clothes 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.880
 royalty is neither a gentleman nor a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.130
 warrior or anything and the truth is that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.380
 it's pretty good to give entrance to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.990
 some city or some building like now 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.760
 I said I made this one here for 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.010
 that you can see it is over and 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.800
 let's build the next one to 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.540
 so give this symmetry that we try 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.970
 search sometimes in our 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.380
 constructions so we will start is 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.900
 very simple we just need 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.240
 white clay because it is not white at all 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.430
 it's like this color so skin law 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.320
 brown that would be to use as clothes 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.880
 this as always because you can change it 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.710
 to your liking and use the color that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.030
 you want and even the skin if you want it 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.130
 change to green to make some 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.810
 zombie statues for your city of 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.180
 halloween then you can also perfect 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.340
 do it and then we'll use a little bit of 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.349
 wall of covers tone for 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.870
 the stake is that the little we can 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.000
 build and do with different shapes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.840
 either as if it were a sword or as 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.840
 if it were a 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.580
 what's that called as those species of 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.280
 lances having three points as 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.840
 says one in that kind of thing then let's go 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.489
 to build it let's make sure that 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.230
 be all symmetric we have started here 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.569
 in this area a block out there 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.170
 it is simply to place the foot like that and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.450
 we place 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.349
 blocks so it's worth this way we do 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.930
 the body this will rise and pull towards a 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.700
 side this side we will do here our 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.950
 arm that is very simple and here they will go 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.900
 two blocks so we will place here the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.480
 head sticking out a little towards 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 ahead it's worth it because it's like that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.840
 a half crouched forward and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.270
 we do more or less how do you have to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.090
 go and we'll just go down these two 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.769
 blocks and we will place the foot here like this 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.060
 as you see then the other arm 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.410
 it would simply be to place it like this and 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.720
 This way we would have our 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.750
 completely symmetrical statues we 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.819
 will miss the spear that we will place 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.620
 right here crossing the hand 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.600
 obviously not that I have it is not that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.549
 the technique stuck in the arm but 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.530
 he is taking it but as we do not have 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.540
 enough space with these cubes 1 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.580
 meter by a meter as to make fingers 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.380
 because we do so and so and 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.780
 we would have our two statues we are going to 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.060
 put a little bit of weeds here 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.700
 to decorate something you already know that I like 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.090
 always place a few herbs and 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.410
 we already have our entry so great 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.600
 also with ideas 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.790
 and it looks very good now what 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.950
 modifications we could make to everything 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.740
 this we could put here the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.960
 sides a few more fences to give the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.940
 feeling that these are swords that 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.010
 they are stuck in the ground even 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.250
 you could change the material of the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.980
 parts of the handle but we could also 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.450
 change all this and transform it into a 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.200
 throw something like that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.780
 1 2 and 3 and in this way we have 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.880
 another style of weapon this you already know that 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.340
 it's a little to your taste you can 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.290
 to do it as you most seem to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.660
 it looks good me in my case I prefer 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.550
 use for normals since that 's what 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.610
 that fits me better in my construction 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.700
 what I have then doing and simply 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.940
 this is what is most appropriate not to the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.030
 style of everything so good if you have 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.340
 these these dwarfs here put and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.470
 giant dwarfs, you can also 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.820
 make them with other positions and I have 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.100
 been looking at a few though 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.480
 I really do not need them but good 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.850
 you can go for weapons is 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.200
 just go mixing a little bit of 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.810
 the pieces and can go creating more things 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.100
 nice no more more like to do in 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.930
 amusement parks for example 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.110
 could you do something like this 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.020
 you do this like this you do here two and you do 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.320
 the arms that would go like this and here you put 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.510
 the arms so one down and the other 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.340
 also down and the head 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.600
 equally placed and in this way 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.000
 we would have here a man sitting 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.920
 to give an example or if you want to 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.570
 example make a saying that you have here 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.040
 something in your hand and that is giving it to you 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.130
 as for example we could put so 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.160
 the two legs we put here with three 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.240
 of height the body and we place the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.480
 sleeves we put here the arms and this 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.160
 sorry we would put it like this is worth the 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.150
 head always always stays the same 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.610
 I think it's the best way to 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.780
 place it on the head put like this 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.220
 obviously if you want, you can do it 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.890
 as he had done and today you have an uncle 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.380
 normal but I do not know I think something is missing 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.930
 it is not better to put it in some way 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.300
 giving you something or having your arm bent 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.190
 whatever you like most 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.430
 even as well as prepared to fight or 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.140
 something I do not know this as I say it's a lot 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.240
 your imagination and what you 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.520
 you think it's better even 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.920
 because obviously you can settle with 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.590
 arms extended as well as for 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.600
 give you a hug or you can put it like that 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.490
 that is even more like a hug like 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.470
 you want and I say this is 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.230
 just in the normal way and then 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.260
 you already put your arms and even if you already 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.960
 you are very adventurous if you want 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.300
 is to try different things we can do 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.680
 for example what would be these 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.960
 I do not even know why I've removed them here 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.360
 we would put the head and we could place 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.419
 here 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.719
 this like this place the arms here 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:57.990
 just do so and here place 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.370
 this in this way and the legs and 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.099
 we would have an uncle doing here the 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.750
 pine and we could even put ourselves like that 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:06.509
 although then it works a little 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.069
 too cow and let me merge a 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.500
 little too much with the head but 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.990
 is not that it is not bad and then 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.330
 we can really try to do many 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.780
 many different positions we can 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.090
 try many very different things and 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.099
 well, what can really be done 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.500
 all this and the limit of yours 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:27.569
 imagination as they always say so 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.150
 well this has been all for this video 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:33.330
 I hope if there is a liked these statues 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.490
 here to give your welcome 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.990
 constructions so remember to give 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.699
 I like to subscribe if you are not yet 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.560
 and share it with your friends 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:44.270
 this has been graft art and we will become 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.270
 to see before what you think
