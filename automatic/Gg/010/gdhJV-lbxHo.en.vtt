00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
really speak on that because I've

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.930 
really speak on that because I've
definitely<00:02:14.210> not<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.860> drop<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.340> iPad<00:02:16.730> on

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
purpose in this case or anything but

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.760 
purpose in this case or anything but
it's<00:02:19.550> not<00:02:19.790> really<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.570> most<00:02:20.780> luxurious<00:02:21.410> case

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
it's not really the most luxurious case

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.670 
it's not really the most luxurious case
if<00:02:22.100> you're<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.820> for<00:02:23.120> durability<00:02:23.810> that's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
if you're going for durability that's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.260 
if you're going for durability that's
not<00:02:24.830> really<00:02:25.250> what<00:02:25.370> it's<00:02:25.490> made<00:02:25.610> for<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.940> think

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
not really what it's made for I think

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.910 
not really what it's made for I think
it's<00:02:26.540> made<00:02:26.810> for<00:02:27.020> propping<00:02:27.350> your<00:02:27.440> iPad<00:02:27.740> up

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
it's made for propping your iPad up

it's made for propping your iPad up
keeping<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.640> thin<00:02:28.820> stuff<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
keeping it thin stuff like that so I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.140 
keeping it thin stuff like that so I
wouldn't<00:02:31.459> recommend<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.880> if<00:02:32.030> you're

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
wouldn't recommend this if you're

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.820 
wouldn't recommend this if you're
looking<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.480> something<00:02:32.660> super<00:02:33.170> sturdy<00:02:33.410> to

give to your kids and let them run

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.449 
give to your kids and let them run

out with their iPad air and they still

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.330 
out with their iPad air and they still
want<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.330> keep<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.170> same<00:02:42.200> size<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.220> the
