their serum primer before and it was

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.000 
their serum primer before and it was
pretty<00:00:17.940> good<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.980> only

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
primer that I've used that I've seen a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.710 
primer that I've used that I've seen a
significant<00:00:23.550> difference<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> end<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
significant difference at the end of the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.210 
significant difference at the end of the
day<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.199> first<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.710> thought<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.949> was<00:00:26.039> my

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
day at first I thought it was my

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
day at first I thought it was my
foundation<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.300> raving<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
foundation and I was raving about the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
foundation and I was raving about the
foundation<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> wore<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.460> next

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
foundation but then I wore it the next

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
foundation but then I wore it the next
day<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> foundation<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
day with just the foundation and not the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
day with just the foundation and not the
primer<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.570> realized<00:00:33.989> huh<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.469> really

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
primer and I realized huh it really

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280 
primer and I realized huh it really
doesn't<00:00:35.250> look<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> decided<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
doesn't look as good so I decided to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
doesn't look as good so I decided to
test<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> few<00:00:38.160> days<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> row<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.790> sure

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
test it out a few days in a row and sure

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.860 
test it out a few days in a row and sure
enough<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.899> makes<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.980> foundation<00:00:41.730> last<00:00:42.600> all

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870

i'm pretty sure it's going to be a
consistent<00:01:43.229> spring<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.009> summer<00:01:44.220> favorite<00:01:44.700> my

I've<00:01:50.340> always<00:01:50.610> loved<00:01:51.060> nude<00:01:51.420> eyeliners<00:01:52.110> because

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I've always loved nude eyeliners because

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
I've always loved nude eyeliners because
it<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.670> waterline<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it can just go on your waterline and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
it can just go on your waterline and
gives<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.110> brightness<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.680> eyes

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
gives a lot of brightness to your eyes

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800 
gives a lot of brightness to your eyes
but<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> doesn't<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:56.969> too<00:01:57.180> harsh<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
but it doesn't look too harsh like a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
but it doesn't look too harsh like a
white<00:01:58.110> pencil<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.210> one

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
white pencil and so this one is one

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.999 
white pencil and so this one is one
where<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.290> actually<00:02:01.380> wear<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.860> my

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
where I can actually wear it on my

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
where I can actually wear it on my
waterline<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.820> doesn't<00:02:03.149> irritate<00:02:03.299> my

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
waterline and it doesn't irritate my

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600 
waterline and it doesn't irritate my
eyes<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.799> from<00:02:05.040> Rimmel<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
eyes I know there's one from Rimmel that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.219 
eyes I know there's one from Rimmel that
just<00:02:05.820> came<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.299> also<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> matte<00:02:06.960> nude

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
just came out that's also a matte nude

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.380 
just came out that's also a matte nude
so<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.069> might<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.520> more<00:02:08.910> cost-effective

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
so that might be a more cost-effective

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
so that might be a more cost-effective
option<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.830> definitely<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
option but definitely with the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.910 
option but definitely with the
nude<00:02:12.000> pencils<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.689> would<00:02:12.840> go<00:02:12.989> for<00:02:13.019> am<00:02:13.379> at<00:02:13.650> one

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
nude pencils I would go for am at one

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.559 
nude pencils I would go for am at one
instead<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.610> shimmery<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.120> cuz<00:02:15.299> it'll<00:02:15.480> look

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
instead of a shimmery one cuz it'll look

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
instead of a shimmery one cuz it'll look
just<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.049> bit<00:02:16.290> more<00:02:16.409> natural<00:02:16.890> I've<00:02:17.159> also

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.210

been<00:02:17.909> really<00:02:18.390> obsessed<00:02:18.629> with<00:02:19.079> doing<00:02:19.439> my<00:02:19.799> brows
