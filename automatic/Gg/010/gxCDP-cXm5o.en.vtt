lost half the population in the process
so<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.580> recommended<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.299> are<00:03:01.450> better<00:03:01.720> off

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
so not recommended you are better off

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.570 
so not recommended you are better off
asking<00:03:02.049> call<00:03:02.590> them<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.860> be<00:03:02.980> peeled<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.459> do
