different way that you would like to do

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.460 
different way that you would like to do
it<00:04:48.180> that's<00:04:49.180> what<00:04:49.389> imagination<00:04:49.960> is<00:04:50.080> for<00:04:50.290> that's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
it that's what imagination is for that's

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.530 
it that's what imagination is for that's
how<00:04:50.650> I've<00:04:50.830> done<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.190> but<00:04:51.550> let's<00:04:51.790> decorate<00:04:52.030> our

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
how I've done it but let's decorate our

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.720 
how I've done it but let's decorate our
base<00:04:52.810> with<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.590> butterflies<00:04:54.010> now<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.250> find<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
base with the butterflies now I find the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.100 
base with the butterflies now I find the
best<00:04:54.910> way<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.060> do<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.419> with<00:04:55.540> these<00:04:55.690> butterflies

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
best way to do it with these butterflies

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.930 
best way to do it with these butterflies
is<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.470> use<00:04:56.620> some<00:04:56.830> melted<00:04:57.160> chocolate<00:04:57.190> not<00:04:57.700> some

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
is to use some melted chocolate not some
