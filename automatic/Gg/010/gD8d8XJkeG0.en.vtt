00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.989
 good afternoon dear subscribers today 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:28.029
 you are still old and have a great accessory 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.340
 so today we will talk about 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.070
 it you probably have seen in some of my 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.589
 video how he used a lot of sleep 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.600
 questions in the comments like this thing 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.730
 works and where does she come from? 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.729
 there and than she walks here i am to you now 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:49.629
 I will tell it means it is a rbg layout rather not 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:52.090
 layout this is shot this is 26 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.460
 well, the pipe itself is empty but it 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:59.280
 altered a little left here 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.280
 button and it works on electro descent 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:07.800
 she walks with our loved ones like this 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.929
 such wires 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.280
 which is on the rocket grenade 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:25.750
 strike striker 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:29.180
 did everything certified as you can see 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.930
 the producers are very doing everything soundly 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.420
 you can eat it for advertising 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.770
 Yes, we have been using manual for a whole year. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.399
 grenades are the best option in my opinion 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.110
 on price and quality so okay sky 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:50.289
 let's tell in general look about 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.299
 the rocket here is the tube here 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.880
 includes its own plug and it works from 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.729
 a half volt that is there inside 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.179
 initiator electro initiator charge and 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.450
 a rocket that crashes and stumbles around 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.709
 probably 80 meters where she sings and there 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.599
 my eighth corsair 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:13.400
 that is pea filler she 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.860
 crashes for at least let's recall 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.730
 be one we will explain i will show you how 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.730
 something inside 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.760
 Well if you take a rocket and insert 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.840
 back on basically be still in 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.510
 working condition so but we tore 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.989
 seal and in general here here is such 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.989
 rocket 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:44.239
 pulled out very tight here itself 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:47.689
 rocket with plumage that's it 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.250
 charge and this is what I understand so that rocket 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.299
 engine yes here it is black powder rather 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
 total pusher 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.109
 option this he ignites the rocket 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.359
 takes off 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.670
 inside there, well, probably not seen there 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.769
 electro initiator general 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.030
 rocket she will fly today not 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.209
 kill someone there 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:14.150
 let's show you how it is 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:17.739
 fly here in the pipe and also probably 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.739
 will and fly out of the year 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.590
 was put 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:28.820
 so I still want to tell you about the shells 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.270
 we ourselves have figured out what's what 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.340
 grenade launcher in general was here before 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.010
 button yes who is familiar here 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.440
 the needle and here the capsule of the present is 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.940
 all removed just put the wiring 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:49.890
 here is a fuse here is a button 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.480
 launcher and here in general is 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.810
 batteries that do initiation 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.540
 plug which connect where 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.190
 connect rocket before rocket 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.190
 inserted like this 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:25.789
 inserted tight here you see it 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:25.789
 contact from turn on carry turn on 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.089
 all the projectile is ready 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.820
 now we will 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.560
 try i run up 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.760
 in general, everything is done simply and conveniently 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.680
 so she blows it all over there 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:36.060
 queens 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.060
 can't see it is not peter on
