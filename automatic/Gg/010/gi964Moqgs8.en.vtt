00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
really know but um yeah here is the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.149 
really know but um yeah here is the
vinyl<00:01:19.710> figure<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:21.390> heavy<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
vinyl figure it's pretty heavy for a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
vinyl figure it's pretty heavy for a
figure<00:01:23.880> um<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> problem

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
figure um that's where the problem

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
figure um that's where the problem
source<00:01:25.740> lies<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:27.150> over<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
source lies in but I go over the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
source lies in but I go over the
aesthetics<00:01:28.110> first<00:01:28.439> um<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
aesthetics first um so as you can see it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.870 
aesthetics first um so as you can see it
looks<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.570> nice<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.259> paint<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.680> also<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
looks very nice the paint is also if you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
looks very nice the paint is also if you
see<00:01:33.030> any<00:01:33.150> dust<00:01:33.360> appear<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:33.750> probably

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
see any dust appear that's probably

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.260 
see any dust appear that's probably
because<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.950> pulled<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.310> off<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.610> shelf

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
because I just pulled it off my shelf

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
because I just pulled it off my shelf
and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.259> probably<00:01:37.500> should<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.829> cleaned<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and I probably should have cleaned it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
and I probably should have cleaned it
off<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.549> bit<00:01:38.640> first<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
off a little bit first but it's not that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.789 
off a little bit first but it's not that
noticeable<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.680> much

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
noticeable it's really not that much

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
noticeable it's really not that much
anyways<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.850> um<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.619> nice

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
anyways but um this is a really nice

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
anyways but um this is a really nice

you can still see a little bit of like

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.260

comes<00:04:40.539> the<00:04:40.599> problem<00:04:40.810> with<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.169> figure<00:04:41.380> is

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
comes the problem with this figure is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.189 
comes the problem with this figure is
that<00:04:41.710> his<00:04:42.699> weight<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.300> all<00:04:43.539> over<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.990> place

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
that his weight is all over the place

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.770 
that his weight is all over the place
like<00:04:44.979> his<00:04:45.340> head<00:04:45.729> takes<00:04:46.660> up<00:04:46.870> at<00:04:47.139> least<00:04:47.639> friggin

like his head takes up at least friggin
60%<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:49.870> his<00:04:49.930> body<00:04:49.990> weight<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:51.310> it's<00:04:51.490> really

there<00:05:37.780> we<00:05:37.870> go<00:05:37.960> okay<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.610> really<00:05:40.270> depends<00:05:40.599> on

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
there we go okay it really depends on

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.899 
there we go okay it really depends on
how<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:40.930> pose<00:05:41.349> them<00:05:41.560> like<00:05:42.460> we<00:05:42.639> haven't

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
how you pose them like we haven't

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.969 
how you pose them like we haven't
straight<00:05:43.570> out<00:05:43.690> like<00:05:43.870> this<00:05:44.020> it'll<00:05:44.349> slowly<00:05:44.620> fall

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
straight out like this it'll slowly fall

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.159 
straight out like this it'll slowly fall
down<00:05:45.300> but<00:05:46.300> if<00:05:46.449> you<00:05:46.509> have<00:05:46.599> it<00:05:46.719> out<00:05:46.780> like<00:05:46.960> this

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
down but if you have it out like this

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.100 
down but if you have it out like this
sometimes<00:05:47.620> it'll<00:05:47.830> stay<00:05:48.099> so<00:05:49.090> it<00:05:49.389> it<00:05:49.810> really

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
sometimes it'll stay so it it really

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.540 
sometimes it'll stay so it it really
depends<00:05:50.469> on<00:05:50.590> how<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.800> want<00:05:51.039> to<00:05:51.070> pose<00:05:51.250> them<00:05:51.460> I

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
depends on how you want to pose them I

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.100 
depends on how you want to pose them I
usually<00:05:51.789> just<00:05:52.120> keep<00:05:52.240> them<00:05:52.419> like<00:05:52.630> something

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
usually just keep them like something

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.020 
usually just keep them like something
like<00:05:53.229> this<00:05:53.409> when<00:05:53.949> I<00:05:54.039> really<00:05:54.250> like<00:05:54.340> this<00:05:54.520> but<00:05:54.789> I

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
like this when I really like this but I

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.719 
like this when I really like this but I
haven't<00:05:55.449> microphones<00:05:56.169> up<00:05:56.380> if<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.340> can<00:05:57.520> get<00:05:57.669> it

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
haven't microphones up if I can get it

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.439 
haven't microphones up if I can get it
to<00:05:57.789> stay<00:05:57.969> up<00:05:58.349> like<00:05:59.349> that<00:05:59.530> oh<00:06:00.270> because<00:06:01.270> this

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
to stay up like that oh because this

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.149 
to stay up like that oh because this
figure<00:06:01.719> really<00:06:01.930> isn't<00:06:02.139> for<00:06:02.349> play<00:06:02.590> at<00:06:02.710> all<00:06:02.830> it's

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.450 
Exxon's figure and just start tearing it
apart<00:06:25.930> because<00:06:26.320> that's<00:06:26.800> not<00:06:26.979> what<00:06:27.250> it's<00:06:27.400> for

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
apart because that's not what it's for

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.270 
apart because that's not what it's for
um<00:06:28.409> so<00:06:29.409> yeah<00:06:29.560> this<00:06:29.710> figure<00:06:29.979> is<00:06:30.130> actually

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
um so yeah this figure is actually

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.510 
um so yeah this figure is actually
really<00:06:30.729> really<00:06:30.880> cool<00:06:31.300> it's<00:06:31.659> just<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.520> the

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
really really cool it's just that the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.430 
really really cool it's just that the
weight<00:06:33.729> problem<00:06:34.120> to<00:06:34.210> sort<00:06:34.389> of<00:06:34.539> bring<00:06:35.199> it<00:06:35.289> down

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
weight problem to sort of bring it down

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.930 
weight problem to sort of bring it down
a<00:06:35.469> little<00:06:35.589> bit<00:06:35.830> because<00:06:36.130> you<00:06:36.430> have

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
a little bit because you have

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.130 
a little bit because you have
less<00:06:38.140> posing<00:06:38.980> abilities<00:06:39.430> but<00:06:40.360> if<00:06:40.600> you<00:06:40.750> want<00:06:40.960> a

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140
