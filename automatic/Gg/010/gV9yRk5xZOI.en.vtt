00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
can but I'm going to tell you how I did

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.000 
can but I'm going to tell you how I did
it<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> teenagers<00:00:55.620> out

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it and I know a lot of teenagers out

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.680 
it and I know a lot of teenagers out
there<00:00:56.190> those<00:00:56.340> struggle<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.000> bulimia<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
there those struggle with bulimia and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.229 
there those struggle with bulimia and
anorexia<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.160> absolutely<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
anorexia and I absolutely think that is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.150 
anorexia and I absolutely think that is
not<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.890> change

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
not the way to go and if you just change

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
not the way to go and if you just change
your<00:01:02.309> eating<00:01:02.489> habits<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.840> absolutely

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
your eating habits you can absolutely

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.300 
your eating habits you can absolutely
lose<00:01:05.100> weight<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.740> totally<00:01:07.740> healthy<00:01:07.979> way

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
lose weight and totally healthy way

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370 
lose weight and totally healthy way
without<00:01:08.850> doing<00:01:09.030> anything<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
without doing anything like that and I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.899 
without doing anything like that and I
know<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> mental<00:01:11.310> sickness<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
know that that is a mental sickness and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.859 
know that that is a mental sickness and
I<00:01:12.000> am<00:01:12.210> totally<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.939> have<00:01:14.939> no<00:01:15.119> idea<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I am totally I have no idea how that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
I am totally I have no idea how that
works<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.340> kind

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
works but I think that if you just kind

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.929 
works but I think that if you just kind
of<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.450> past<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.159> decide<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of get past it and you know decide to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
of get past it and you know decide to
eat<00:01:21.090> healthy<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.750> won't<00:01:22.259> need<00:01:22.409> any<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
eat healthy you won't need any of that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
eat healthy you won't need any of that
and<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.820> harmful<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.390> body<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900

of green tea a big glass and then I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.690 
of green tea a big glass and then I
would<00:03:28.220> eat<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:29.540> can<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.440> tuna<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.980> know<00:03:31.220> that

than I thought especially if you mix it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.449 
than I thought especially if you mix it
with<00:03:35.000> something<00:03:35.420> like<00:03:35.569> um<00:03:35.950> tomatoes<00:03:37.030> celery

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
with something like um tomatoes celery

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
with something like um tomatoes celery
green<00:03:40.459> peppers<00:03:40.910> anything<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.690> will

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
green peppers anything like that will

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.379 
green peppers anything like that will
make<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.799> taste<00:03:42.950> better<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.359> lot

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
make it taste better and it's a lot

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.240 
make it taste better and it's a lot
easier<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.959> take<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.380> then<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.560> saw<00:03:45.889> it<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.190> you
