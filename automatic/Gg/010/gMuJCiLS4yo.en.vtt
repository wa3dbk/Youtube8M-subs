in<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.850> tutorial<00:00:03.120> I'll<00:00:03.629> show<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.959> how<00:00:04.080> to

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.350 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to
animate<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.609> default<00:00:06.089> cube<00:00:07.880> the<00:00:08.880> window<00:00:09.210> at

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
animate the default cube the window at

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.480 
animate the default cube the window at
the<00:00:09.450> bottom<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.200> default<00:00:10.679> layout<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the bottom of the default layout is a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.860 
the bottom of the default layout is a
timeline<00:00:12.420> window<00:00:13.730> to<00:00:14.730> animate<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> cube<00:00:15.570> we

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
timeline window to animate the cube we

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
timeline window to animate the cube we
have<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> insert<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.920> least<00:00:17.310> two<00:00:17.609> keyframes

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
have to insert at least two keyframes

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.679

setup<00:00:46.950> keyframes<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> rhyme<00:00:48.719> which

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
setup keyframes I have a rhyme which

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.369 
setup keyframes I have a rhyme which
helps<00:00:49.890> me<00:00:50.039> remember<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:51.180> steps<00:00:51.510> involved<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
helps me remember the steps involved and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.910 
helps me remember the steps involved and
the<00:00:52.829> order<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> rhyme<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.680> go

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the order to do them in the rhyme is go

that<00:02:23.460> if<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.700> click<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.120> play<00:02:24.330> button<00:02:24.410> we<00:02:25.410> see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
that if I click the play button we see

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.850 
that if I click the play button we see
the<00:02:25.740> cube<00:02:26.010> move<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.720> process<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.500> calculating

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the cube move the process of calculating

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.030 
the cube move the process of calculating
the<00:02:29.610> location<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.260> between<00:02:31.650> frames

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the location for the in between frames

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.830 
the location for the in between frames
is<00:02:32.640> called<00:02:33.300> interpolation<00:02:35.480> that's<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.720> end

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
is called interpolation that's the end

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.260 
is called interpolation that's the end
of<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.200> tutorial<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.340> next<00:02:38.490> tutorial

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
of this tutorial in the next tutorial

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.120 
of this tutorial in the next tutorial
I'll<00:02:39.420> show<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.989> how<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.290> use<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.709> graph

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
I'll show you how to use the graph

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.830 
I'll show you how to use the graph
editor<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:42.330> alter<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.989> interpolation
