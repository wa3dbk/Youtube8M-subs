yet doesn't really fit the song but here
you<00:01:45.580> get<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.940> idea<00:01:46.300> so<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.780> built<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.530> song

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
you get the idea so you built the song

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.560 
you get the idea so you built the song
by<00:01:48.430> placing<00:01:49.180> blocks<00:01:49.510> on<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.140> timeline

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.210 

alright<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:56.110> how<00:01:56.560> does<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.800> work<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.770> we

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
alright so how does it work well if we

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.610 
alright so how does it work well if we
just<00:02:00.250> go<00:02:01.060> behind<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.750> maybe<00:02:02.020> you'll<00:02:02.410> get<00:02:02.560> a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
just go behind it maybe you'll get a

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.830 
just go behind it maybe you'll get a
better<00:02:02.860> idea<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.730> first<00:02:04.120> let's<00:02:04.420> take<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.720> look

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
better idea so first let's take a look

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.110 
better idea so first let's take a look
from<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.170> behind<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.010> then<00:02:06.670> I'll<00:02:06.790> take<00:02:06.970> a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
from the behind and then I'll take a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.510 
from the behind and then I'll take a
look<00:02:07.240> from<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.900> side

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
setting is so take a look at the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.370 
setting is so take a look at the
timeline<00:02:40.720> as<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:44.050> placed

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
timeline as you can see I have placed

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.949 
timeline as you can see I have placed
3rd<00:02:44.800> box<00:02:45.070> on<00:02:45.280> top<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.640> them<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:46.690> top<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
3rd box on top of them on top of the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.449 
3rd box on top of them on top of the
timeline<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:49.200> minecart<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.470> someone<00:02:51.040> here

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
timeline and a minecart is someone here

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.680 
timeline and a minecart is someone here
and<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:51.970> being<00:02:52.240> teleported<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:54.730> block<00:02:55.150> each

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
and it's being teleported one block each

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.320 
and it's being teleported one block each
redstone<00:02:56.410> six<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:56.980> that's<00:02:57.160> ten<00:02:57.580> redstone<00:02:58.030> six

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
redstone six so that's ten redstone six

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.300 
redstone six so that's ten redstone six
per<00:02:58.540> second<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:01.690> going<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.989> cone<00:03:02.440> one

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
per second and it's going to cone one

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.740 
per second and it's going to cone one
one<00:03:03.670> at<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> time<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.770> if<00:03:06.100> we<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.580> two<00:03:07.060> dirt<00:03:07.420> box

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
one at a time so if we have two dirt box

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.690 
one at a time so if we have two dirt box
here<00:03:08.110> it's<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> soak<00:03:08.830> onto<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.459> box

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
here it's going to soak onto the box

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.040 
here it's going to soak onto the box
there<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:12.489> cobblestone<00:03:12.970> here<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:13.750> going<00:03:13.959> to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
also going to power the null box so well

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.590 
also going to power the null box so well
what<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:22.900> get<00:03:23.050> from<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.260> well<00:03:24.390> if<00:03:25.390> you

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
what do we get from that well if you

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.449 
what do we get from that well if you
power<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.959> like<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:28.770> it's<00:03:29.770> going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.130> make<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
power it like this it's going to make a

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.920 
power it like this it's going to make a
sound<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:32.340> each<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.790> those<00:03:34.000> top<00:03:34.360> box<00:03:34.600> has<00:03:34.900> a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
sound and each of those top box has a

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.520 
sound and each of those top box has a
different<00:03:35.500> pitch<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.510> we<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.780> tune<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.290> like

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
different pitch so we can tune it like

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.780 
different pitch so we can tune it like
this<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.370> then<00:03:40.120> replace<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:42.040> block<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.610> get<00:03:42.730> a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
this and then replace the block to get a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.710 
this and then replace the block to get a
different<00:03:43.180> sound<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:44.470> that's<00:03:44.680> how<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.070> works

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
different sound so that's how it works

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.980 
different sound so that's how it works
again<00:03:46.720> let's<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.730> place<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:49.180> few<00:03:49.510> random<00:03:49.720> ones

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
again let's just place a few random ones

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.800 
again let's just place a few random ones
and<00:03:51.080> go<00:03:51.380> behind<00:03:51.830> again<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:56.300> can<00:03:56.360> see<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
and go behind again as you can see the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.290 
and go behind again as you can see the
box<00:03:57.020> that<00:03:57.110> we<00:03:57.230> placed<00:03:57.560> appear<00:03:58.280> here<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.700> yeah

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
box that we placed appear here so yeah

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.230 
box that we placed appear here so yeah
that's<00:04:02.570> pretty<00:04:02.900> simple<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.350> guess<00:04:06.910> alright<00:04:07.910> so

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
that's pretty simple I guess alright so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.720 
that's pretty simple I guess alright so
this<00:04:08.540> actually<00:04:09.140> wasn't<00:04:09.470> made<00:04:09.830> by<00:04:09.860> me

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730

controls<00:04:36.140> subway<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.250> stop<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:39.050> you're<00:04:39.230> not

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
controls subway and stop so you're not

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.440 
controls subway and stop so you're not
limited<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.700> specific<00:04:40.910> area<00:04:41.540> you<00:04:41.930> can<00:04:42.110> just

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
limited to a specific area you can just

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.630 
limited to a specific area you can just
start<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.720> stop<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.290> song<00:04:45.590> anywhere<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.370> are

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
start and stop the song anywhere you are

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.170 
start and stop the song anywhere you are
it<00:04:46.970> doesn't<00:04:47.000> really<00:04:47.360> matter<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:49.180> also

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
it doesn't really matter and also

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.810 
it doesn't really matter and also
another<00:04:51.010> button<00:04:52.600> is<00:04:53.600> expand<00:04:54.350> timeline<00:04:54.920> and<00:04:55.220> if

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
another button is expand timeline and if

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:06.749 
another button is expand timeline and if
we<00:04:55.970> just<00:04:56.000> go<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:57.200> end

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.679 

so<00:05:07.479> this<00:05:07.809> is<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.110> end<00:05:08.319> of<00:05:08.499> the<00:05:08.680> song<00:05:08.949> and<00:05:09.689> for

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
so this is the end of the song and for

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.249 
so this is the end of the song and for
the<00:05:10.779> timeline<00:05:11.199> it<00:05:11.499> ends<00:05:12.009> here<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:14.080> does

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
the timeline it ends here and it does

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.730 
the timeline it ends here and it does
really<00:05:14.499> matter<00:05:14.889> if<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:16.479> ends<00:05:16.930> or<00:05:17.110> not<00:05:17.349> but

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
really matter if it ends or not but

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.059 
really matter if it ends or not but
after<00:05:18.610> some<00:05:19.419> time<00:05:19.689> after<00:05:20.289> the<00:05:20.439> song<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.830> swung

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
after some time after the song is swung

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.249 
after some time after the song is swung
you're<00:05:21.639> actually<00:05:22.029> not<00:05:22.150> going<00:05:22.389> to<00:05:22.539> be<00:05:22.990> able<00:05:23.080> to

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
you're actually not going to be able to

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.369 
you're actually not going to be able to
see<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.919> piano<00:05:24.099> itself<00:05:24.639> and<00:05:25.029> then<00:05:25.990> can<00:05:26.229> get

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
see the piano itself and then can get

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.429 
see the piano itself and then can get
confusing<00:05:26.919> like<00:05:27.219> where<00:05:27.490> they<00:05:27.639> place<00:05:27.969> what<00:05:28.439> so

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
confusing like where they place what so

for that I have the timeline and if they
expand<00:05:32.889> timeline<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.960> queue<00:05:34.960> can<00:05:35.080> just<00:05:35.409> expand

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
expand timeline a queue can just expand

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.939 
expand timeline a queue can just expand

unloaded<00:06:01.990> chunks<00:06:02.020> so<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.860> added<00:06:03.249> a<00:06:03.399> few<00:06:03.430> chunk

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
unloaded chunks so I added a few chunk

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.320 
unloaded chunks so I added a few chunk
holders<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:04.960> now<00:06:05.199> it<00:06:05.349> should<00:06:05.819> work<00:06:06.819> piece<00:06:07.059> well

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
holders so now it should work piece well

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.749 
holders so now it should work piece well
and<00:06:07.779> I<00:06:08.710> guess<00:06:08.889> that's<00:06:09.159> it<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.919> again<00:06:12.219> don't

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
and I guess that's it so again don't

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.850 
and I guess that's it so again don't
