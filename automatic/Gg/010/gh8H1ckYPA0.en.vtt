00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.399
 for the third year, robert geesink stayed in the sierra nevada the trainer 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.790
 at height that you are an important part of the 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.410
 preparing geesink for the tour de france are this year's main objective 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.720
 it is still a few weeks away read more and more at the leader of the 

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:17.759
 rabo team 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.039
 and janssens 56 who are white and have empathy for the pier in egypt white 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.099
 and that starts real life with the nmbs with the tour 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.460
 being busy with 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 certainly during the caravan but also here is the first team is that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.960
 boys who 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.230
 we are naturally years that are with the men with whom you also dian all this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.180
 feed the tire over the floor 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.219
 do certain things and how you get used to and you get 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.590
 so yes it is now 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.270
 this year the countdown 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.750
 this will be the other round of the tour de france that he has on twitter 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.650
 know 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.820
 in that it was mainly Denis Mentsjov that was looked at, but the Russian is gone 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.850
 takes over and knows that all about those are aimed at them 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.600
 well i think that the netherlands such a last year so also in the film 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.610
 own yard to the fairer 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.410
 so in that regard the vermeire not very different but never can 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.370
 to sit 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.370
 before that his reason with two leaders and it is actually 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.490
 the right team divided a 2 into the eleven who work for the one man one 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.190
 another changed and now 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.520
 it in the super and 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.419
 year the ret team released a sign of mine as a classification cyclist 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.140
 and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.500
 That does not mean that I like him every day so need him 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.980
 the singer got opportunities for those men to come 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.190
 for a ride on winnings or 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.800
 saw last Monday session go 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.590
 that makes the team know differently and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.410
 eventually the scourging classification deen everyone agreed that he was the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.859
 that I there 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.790
 especially banks 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.300
 really want to go and do the men fight but even less so 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.880
 that is a nice thing to notice already and there is no tour that we go there too 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.130
 further 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.030
 that went through well and then good agreements were made about it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 but 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 the name yes you now know how it should look 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.710
 it is also a role within the team that is specifically anticipated in that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.859
 big round of course 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.269
 yes I have this is so he now knows for the 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.499
 the five years that I have finished 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.319
 actually every year or in every race but as soon as I have been as a leader 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.629
 so from that it is not a new feeling for me but then the duo also one 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.429
 special competition and 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.709
 it is it is the most important competition of the year and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.799
 but there are 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.149
 jari courtois years of josÃ© baltanas the cats so for me it is also the 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.629
 of course the importance and the most important course and this is special 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.759
 were for the biggest Dutch team when they act as a matchmaker 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.569
 someone who is not here in spain is bauke mollema here would be pregnant 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.430
 in the tour 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.709
 can be important to you 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.830
 yes look bocuse d'or that someone who is also in the past version 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.110
 no that it has talents in rome as the when it goes uphill and 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.089
 that is someone who is very important to me 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:02.279
 a very strong one this year 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.299
 the strong team and 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.559
 yes that team that spring rather with some men before that 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.369
 found a team time trial and that 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:15.019
 yes the hard workers say the important things that sometimes more the 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.059
 television but yes but are very important for a team 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.859
 and so on 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.560
 this one had a ball on and as strong a team as possible 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.950
 Also, there came the exchange rates, there are naturally you go important role 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.109
 play 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.199
 that is why book in a box naturally returned a very important reason 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.699
 why I do that among themselves 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.779
 the performances of pieter weening embark on Kruiswijk and the other teammates 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:39.490
 the giro 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.659
 were followed closely in Spain 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.369
 geesink thinks great inspiration for the tour 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.579
 jade piece beautiful see how he 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.899
 nevertheless have nothing as a result of this 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:54.009
 yes because the politicians that but in the top 10 I am hard but what you now what it is 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.219
 of course mentioned 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.459
 days the dazzling see a spicy direct victory that 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.559
 years are beautiful moments and when you hear the atmosphere is with the fans 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.579
 to have 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.019
 so many beautiful things to ride that is something they are worth 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.549
 it is team management if the team wants to be interrogated 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.249
 and 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.639
 we go as one that in the tour of course the same 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.169
 create a feeling like what is currently happening in the region
