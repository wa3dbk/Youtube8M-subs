00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.520
 pers next process 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:58.910
 here is a feeling that is four days here 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:04.520
 stood warm here on here all along with 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:09.880
 this on the press then she when 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.880
 then it is filled with the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 evenly 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.770
 so twist 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:34.110
 periodically to evenly compartment 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:45.090
 sticks rush do not need to run compartment 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:49.950
 take place wait let it flow down then 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.119
 here we put the shutter we put there 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.929
 periodically remove it from the stone with 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:03.959
 draft in the spring we will model 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.319
 pressing what remains here is this 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.810
 press open a very long time 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:14.420
 it's us now 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.519

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.590
 knife cut it 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.299
 he could have been made good of him 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.299
 dilute with syrup for a few more days 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.660
 it was possible to put a lot of yeast there 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.820
 would make a great grape vodka but 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.390
 since i don't have a decent machine 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.700
 alambik 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.980
 Portuguese next year began 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.010
 I will throw it away 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:48.019
 the moment is not necessary here but the water seal now 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.019
 already delivered juice 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.210
 which turns to guilt
