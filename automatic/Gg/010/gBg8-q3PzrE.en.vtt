00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.580
 December arrives and they bombard us with 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.259
 Ads are buying gifts 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.079
 consume so that our Christmas is 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.510
 perfect in the ideal Christmas however 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.009
 it seems to me that with that one loses a 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.860
 little the true meaning of the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.650
 Christmas then why not best do 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.110
 small gifts to share with the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.570
 people that we want this from here is 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 powdered sugar with egg white 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 and a little water to have them 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.000
 hard and if you want a few drops of lemon 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.510
 for blood sausage 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.170
 and you win the egg sugar powder and lemon 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.910
 it's all until it's the desired texture 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.240
 with this with a mouthpiece they are going to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.720
 to be able to decorate from me what your name is 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.880
 as my husband looks like Carlos in 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.320
 the sleeve has to be so serious 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 well, hairline 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.860
 and then I have more cookies can not be 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.390
 little dots what you want and then what 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.190
 I'm going to give another color in another sleeve 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.430
 we are not talking about great gifts 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.140
 news of small details and if we see 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.670
 to people who have been throughout the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.050
 year with us as for example the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.390
 teachers of our children who have 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.800
 helped so much we always want to send us 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 a small detail as thanks 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.390
 the castilla that have had the affection that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.880
 have shown with our children and they 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.880
 send a little gift or maybe to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.619
 our neighbors 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.509
 to the mom of our friends 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.380
 small children details then instead 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.450
 of buying something you have to buy ten 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
 things like that because it's best not to do 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 something or better that your children do something in 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.310
 this case the diet 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.310
 ah 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.040
 good this way to keep them 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.960
 calm also tina news and everything 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.520
 the rest and I swear to you that really for those 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.650
 means have the motricity recontra 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.720
 developed because I know what little 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.190
 activities do a lot and fascinate 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.340
 and you have them in the kitchen hypnotized 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 peel the verse yes or is there and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.940
 I developed lots of little ones 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 the kitchen always comes out with me 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 always always and are accustomed 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.100
 then it is an activity that always 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.990
 was in the house 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.430
 as it is and the novelty now but 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.830
 always when there is a boy over home 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.250
 play we always invite the kitchen us 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.250
 love 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.590
 in fact you can give a lot 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.360
 personality of the child in when when 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.290
 decorate their cookies because of course 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.480
 super educated girls this trial 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.830
 science appointment came out of the line of 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.360
 biscuit and all perspectives and from there 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.460
 they were the most artistic they did 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.770
 some Christmas trees with thousands of 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.410
 super modern colors worthy of museums 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.010
 of contemporary art and fun 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.290
 then the idea too 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.159
 do not pretend that the cookies here 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.709
 perfect 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:14.360
 part of the charm is that you notice that the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.010
 child can do more but what I do 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.650
 it's always that he grabbed a good recipe 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.170
 of cookies that never fails me and this 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.900
 recipe that is large divide it into two or 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.730
 in four for example with cinnamon erbol or 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.829
 talco chocolate night or TV for 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.720
 put ginger as now for Christmas 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.310
 because not everyone loves in 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.379
 Christmas Christmas sales then no 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.450
 it may be a separate option from 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.010
 chocolates chips up any cookie 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.390
 of valdecilla that you cut it with 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.390
 heart cutter scrambled all 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.260
 good maybe that was also today in the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.840
 blog have a cookie recipe with the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.490
 orange the grass for example three 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.920
 oranges the grass the grass until 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.510
 you have a spoonful of juice that 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.910
 I was super concentrated you put it in the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.680
 mass and you do not know the aroma of truth and the 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.090
 zest is not needed without hard loss 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.760
 in the masses he has incredible but I 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.500
 it seems that it is a way line and 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.910
 taking away the gift theme of passing 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.470
 time with your children this guy 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.480
 activities that later become 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.280
 traditions are the things that guys 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.709
 They are to be cut as they grow to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.900
 better when I was a kid cooked 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.729
 some cookies for friends and maybe 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.269
 if they repeat that tradition 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.269
 with his chair
