00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.939
 And there's beauty, the thulium that 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.009
 is talking 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.529
 I'm coming back here today for you with 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.579
 the analysis this time of a keyboard 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.980
 complete recently someone will be nancy 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.500
 keyboard facing for the better but also 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.739
 you can use to play the types of 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.320
 games my type so way is also well 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.050
 useless clothing also at 10 feet because 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.710
 likes to party too leaves the hand in a 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.830
 a good keyboard I would not say of course 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.730
 bad but it is not is not enough 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.710
 great 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.820
 how people say yes 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.650
 internet acts 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.230
 I 'm going to say that I thought the 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.040
 keyboard and so on what it me 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.560
 disappointed and I liked it 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.390
 so I'm going to pass the act here now 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.659
 human keyboard with leave a video on 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.790
 screen corner 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.740
 the keyboard is this here to talk about the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.960
 first point I did not like and he 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.330
 sound has been deleted as you can see 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.140
 is by this key has nothing to 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.020
 people and gum is dominated on the day the maximum 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.440
 brightness of video 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.299
 you have notion of the nominal actor keyboard 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.780
 of life and I can not see and 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.360
 I took it only works well if you qualify 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.630
 all dark as the big day I guess 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.810
 that can be dealt with every time 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.229
 I think it has improved a little bit that I 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.220
 I think you need to see better now. 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.590
 leave it like this 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.590
 so I take this is an illuminated keyboard 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.780
 can not positive of it is that this 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.409
 lighting it can be made several 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.360
 things 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.970
 it can be eliminated both from green and 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 blue baby rafael gives when you think 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.140
 best 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.299
 another positive point on the keyboard to 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.060
 amount of land and have it have all 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.739
 the keys here five keys here that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.180
 more uses below that can be 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.230
 configured in accordance with your 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.079
 need 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.380
 We also have five more keys and the 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.270
 What are the monkeys for? 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.050
 thus making combinations of buttons and 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.050
 skill keys in games at the end has 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.110
 quite a lot of very negative land that I 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.710
 I think the network is that the multimedia keys 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.420
 It's always good up here and for you. 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.060
 on this multimedia button you have to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 just think this button with the sound is 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.510
 You have to hold the function of 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.220
 increase the volume of a spending economy 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.620
 music, listen to music, it's how I like it 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.330
 enough music and this is annoying 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.370
 so when I 'm not playing leave 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.100
 important on the team here says these 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.370
 keys that would sell strike this I found 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.920
 cool what I can give play to play in 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.000
 middle here passes girl back to music 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:08.110
 This is a nice function, these theses 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.610
 now it's normal for a keyboard like speech is on 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.000
 mechanical keyboard as far as I could 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.970
 realize from the top of the page you do not notice 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.740
 and the mechanical keyboard it has 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.290
 those the match mark of 11 not 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.600
 It can also be the table has also 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.460
 I'm half camper, but he still gives 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.130
 a different key press is not a goal 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.700
 it is not flat but it has the answer of 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.920
 the trainees it is also very good 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.280
 now the negative point is already I spoke with 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.560
 You guys, this lighting is horrible. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.080
 Because I already had him, do not worry 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.640
 that keyboard of the mechanic deputy network 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.120
 most voted because it is concerning the sale 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.330
 parts plus that keyboard lighting 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.130
 absurd face you see from afar 5 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.630
 maximum brightness level can only be 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.500
 decrease or even say that you 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.020
 want to 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.160
 so some keys got to be medium 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.230
 and also another negative point 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.630
 that date remains some of it ax 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.400
 I did not like it very much, I do not think it's in the 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.440
 time can wear 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.240
 I already had the company's products with 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.720
 the same material and wear with the 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.150
 time aside here on the side of black 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.459
 piano and that influences a lot and you 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.459
 will bet on the others finished in 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.690
 black piano also did not like having 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.220
 respect it is clear that it has to 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.920
 time the mother does not have 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.570
 lots of money so there is no point either 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.750
 positive 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.960
 so what I found that keyboard 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.850
 so for those who like the best it's worth 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.260
 sorry because it has enough key 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.170
 you can look for the way you 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.050
 I wanted keys to both pass music 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.710
 account of skillus and the ability to 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.810
 Portuguese truth is pure items on the globe 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.190
 You're the way you want to do it. 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.770
 macro is a keyboard but limit pm 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.670
 now your focus is on one more thing 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.910
 hardcore 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.250
 I did not like keyboard nose up 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.430
 because I prefer it in my opinion 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.410
 I prefer a good lighting key 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.750
 more complexity to test even he 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.610
 does not have a lighting 2010 impressed 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.320
 very 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.690
 so I also did not like it very much 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.940
 the touch of his legs is very felt 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.630
 jealousy is comfortable 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.030
 the good business senac of course you 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.860
 feel is not that you slope right up 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.900
 to know the differences 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.560
 sometimes they will think the goalie but I 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.720
 I feel differences and years take that more 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.110
 anyway it's an expensive keyboard if you 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.700
 imported it pulls to compare with 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.100
 less than 300 reais 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.400
 so of course only with a good price 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:57.680
 Now here in Brazil she was 520 and 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.169
 than the maximum 41 90 480 since I found it 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.030
 be a little on the market and this has to 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.130
 the pre show in the 500 reais 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.140
 So, I think the keyboard does not work. 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.510
 it's worth you to buy you want 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.370
 can you give me the newest model too 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.660
 very influential if you were to play a lot 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.300
 violence 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.460
 I bought the newspaper delicious but not 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.100
 I arrived very accurately every 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.850
 100 because then imagine if of many 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.510
 buttons 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.120
 then I do not think it's worth it if 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.130
 complete ancient religion network keyboard 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.880
 this keyboard is already three years old in the 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.669
 casino and dan 23 years does not remember her 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.370
 but that's it it 's a good deal is not it 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:40.550
 great great when they talk around 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.400
 the keyboard that I think is not worth the 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.139
 had been charging in brazil 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.960
 camila join a little more complete 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.970
 the anthem a desktop waits if that one 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.220
 cheapest from the capital line 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.870
 but in the mean time and lighting and 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.580
 elimination of it is good and I've had and 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.110
 I continue the expression 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.770
 the ad had never seen it then 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.360
 I solved with just protesting in self 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.020
 back the black widow because I do not 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.090
 I really liked him in fame but that's it. 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.639
 if you do not care much for lighting 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:14.690
 At the same time, the better you 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:16.160
 the keyboard is good already said and I hope 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.590
 You liked the analysis. 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.440
 if you have any tips you're missing me 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.470
 to vote a motion only to compare the 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.270
 alienation the portal ismar xuxa here looks 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.000
 only lighting reserve vacancy 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.729
 Look at the difference of the disposal you are 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.010
 giving to finish in the band he was born 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.460
 much stronger only subtracting sides 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.990
 then also launched to pay more than 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.130
 Night in the dark room looks cool. 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.710
 lighting 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.580
 but still still leaves a little 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.320
 Wish 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.810
 so this is thanks for the preview 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.970
 and if you like the video, leave it there 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.470
 that will help a lot in my work and it is 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.220
 I'll keep this until the next one. 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.220
