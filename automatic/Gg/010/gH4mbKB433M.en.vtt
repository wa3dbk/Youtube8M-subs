00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
from AMD perspective it goes all the way

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.090 
from AMD perspective it goes all the way
back<00:00:08.190> into<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:09.510> know<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.050> two<00:00:10.559> thousand<00:00:11.070> and

introduction of

Direct Connect architecture integrated
memory<00:00:17.850> controller<00:00:18.030> the<00:00:18.690> architecture

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
memory controller the architecture

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.040 
memory controller the architecture
itself<00:00:19.380> lent<00:00:19.950> itself<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:21.480> virtualization

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
itself lent itself to to virtualization

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.260 
itself lent itself to to virtualization
we<00:00:22.710> had<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.950> distinct<00:00:23.550> advantage<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
we had a distinct advantage in the

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.690 
we had a distinct advantage in the
market<00:00:24.599> at<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.869> point<00:00:25.400> because<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
market at that point because the

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.310 
market at that point because the
architecture<00:00:27.210> led<00:00:27.360> itself<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.840> well<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.200> this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
architecture led itself so well to this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.980 
architecture led itself so well to this
type<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.560> workload<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.939> also<00:00:30.090> introduced<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
type of workload we also introduced and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.549 
type of workload we also introduced and
we're<00:00:31.110> able<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.470> take<00:00:31.650> advantage<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.190> certain

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
we're able to take advantage of certain

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.869 
we're able to take advantage of certain
extensions<00:00:34.559> within<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
extensions within the in the

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.720 
extensions within the in the
architecture<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.989> enable<00:00:37.440> live<00:00:38.160> migration

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
architecture to enable live migration

architecture to enable live migration
between<00:00:38.940> multiple<00:00:39.980> versions<00:00:40.980> or<00:00:41.460> revisions

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
between multiple versions or revisions

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.049 
between multiple versions or revisions
of<00:00:42.540> AMD<00:00:43.019> processors<00:00:43.830> as<00:00:43.980> well<00:00:44.220> so<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.879> kind<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
of AMD processors as well so it kind of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.210 
of AMD processors as well so it kind of
started<00:00:45.540> in<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.840> error<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.979> move

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
started in that error then as we move

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.100 
started in that error then as we move
forward<00:00:47.400> we<00:00:47.760> introduced<00:00:48.150> AMD<00:00:48.629> virtualization

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
forward we introduced AMD virtualization

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
forward we introduced AMD virtualization
technology<00:00:49.830> or<00:00:49.949> what<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.159> call<00:00:50.190> AMD<00:00:50.790> be<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
technology or what we call AMD be and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450 
technology or what we call AMD be and
that<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.900> really<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.350> incarnation<00:00:53.040> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that was really the first incarnation of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.829 
that was really the first incarnation of
hardware-assisted<00:00:54.470> virtualization<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
hardware-assisted virtualization so it

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.439 
hardware-assisted virtualization so it
had<00:00:58.049> to<00:00:58.080> get<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.559> hardware<00:00:58.769> first<00:00:59.449> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
had to get to the hardware first and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.539 
had to get to the hardware first and
then<00:01:00.989> after<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.589> you<00:01:01.890> started<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.339> see

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
then after that you started to see

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.520 
then after that you started to see
software<00:01:03.030> solutions<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.690> VMware<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
software solutions like VMware and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.969 
software solutions like VMware and
others<00:01:05.750> utilize<00:01:06.750> those<00:01:07.049> extensions<00:01:07.500> within

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
others utilize those extensions within

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
others utilize those extensions within
their<00:01:08.100> software<00:01:08.430> simply<00:01:08.729> making<00:01:09.200> their

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
their software simply making their

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.250 
their software simply making their
software<00:01:10.710> run<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.280> efficiently<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.869> easier

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
software run more efficiently and easier

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.300 
software run more efficiently and easier
to<00:01:13.440> develop<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:16.220> solutions<00:01:17.220> like

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to develop now you have solutions like

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.139
