00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
 hi today a 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.640
 turns out to be heroines seeing him 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.250
 met wonderful places 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.680
 it is time and is called running 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.680
 museum video-ico now I will spend 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 the museum here is quite young and opened 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.950
 just a couple of years ago 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.050
 a visit costs 8 euros per person or 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.330
 360 rubles at today's exchange rate 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.309
 more than justified for this money 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 you can get so many impressions and 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:32.880
 play so many games the museum shared 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 on thematic blocks which 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.469
 demonstrate the development of igor 40 data 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.590
 machines up to today's console 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.590
 days 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.200
 part of especially antique exhibits 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.360
 located behind glass windows but in 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.860
 many can play myself i don't 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.870
 failed to make a pose of granny playing in 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.250
 childhood and seeing a car on a cycle game 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.250
 friends was very happy 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 in the halls of course there were still automatic machines 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.690
 I think everyone would not have enough to play 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.759
 of the day 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 among other machines I want to note 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.140
 machine play fix-it felix 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.060
 and for the moment I saw him in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.860
 in the hall I was sure that the role was 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.190
 specially invented for the eponymous 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.190
 cartoon 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.229
 collections 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.630
 if you play italian 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.530
 and all need 300 thousand 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.530
 not 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.600
 besides the game of thrones on glass 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.060

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.930
 autographed developer witch 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.090
 apparently as it is thematically 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.830
 I framed showcase for resident evil with 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.590
 plastic discs 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.150
 another showcase dedicated and warmed Do 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.730
 Generally in soul but the hall where it is located 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.100
 it is worth talking separately in it now 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.470
 is an exhibition of Japanese paintings 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.750

 parts of the series on the walls hung 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400
 information in general is immediately evident that people 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.430
 approached the business of creating a museum with all 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.770
 responsibility and love for games when 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.990

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.080
