00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
built-in stereo speakers I'm not going

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
built-in stereo speakers I'm not going
to<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> test<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.500> much<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:20.040> gonna

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to get to test this too much I'm gonna

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
to get to test this too much I'm gonna
hook<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> make<00:01:21.210> sure<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> doesn't

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hook it up just to make sure it doesn't

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
hook it up just to make sure it doesn't
have<00:01:21.659> any<00:01:21.689> dead<00:01:21.869> pixels<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> thought<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
have any dead pixels but I thought I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
have any dead pixels but I thought I
would<00:01:23.759> show<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.180> comes<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.720> box

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
would show what comes in the box

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.830 
would show what comes in the box
let<00:01:25.680> me<00:01:25.740> zoom<00:01:25.890> back<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> bit<00:01:27.710> okay<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
let me zoom back out a bit okay so I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.310 
let me zoom back out a bit okay so I
haven't<00:01:30.840> touched<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.140> yet<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
haven't touched this yet that's the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:47.270 
haven't touched this yet that's the
power<00:01:37.530> cable<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.649> audio<00:01:44.159> cable<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
power cable just got audio cable and the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.139 
power cable just got audio cable and the
VGA<00:01:47.790> comes<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> VGA<00:01:48.899> cable<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.850> doesn't

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
VGA comes the VGA cable that doesn't

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.370 
VGA comes the VGA cable that doesn't
come<00:01:51.299> already<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> doesn't<00:01:52.079> come<00:01:52.200> with

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
come already know it doesn't come with

come already know it doesn't come with
the<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:57.000> DVI<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.290> DVI<00:01:58.850> input<00:02:00.350> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the the DVI I think it's DVI input I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
the the DVI I think it's DVI input I
know<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.579> comes<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> DV<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.630> doesn't

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
know it comes with the DV it doesn't

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.870 
know it comes with the DV it doesn't
come<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> DVI<00:02:04.469> cable<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
come with the DVI cable so you have to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.660 
come with the DVI cable so you have to
buy<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:20.930
