switched<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.150> get<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:30.540> more

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
switched in they get a lot more

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.630 
switched in they get a lot more
experience<00:01:31.020> than<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.829> they're<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.369> using

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
experience than if they're just using

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.410 
experience than if they're just using
experience<00:01:33.600> share<00:01:33.780> regularly<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> I'm<00:01:36.210> just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
experience share regularly so I'm just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810

fro<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.460> named<00:02:03.030> froakie<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.170> me<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
fro me I named froakie from me just to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.429 
fro me I named froakie from me just to
showcase<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.549> fro<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.180> meet<00:02:06.540> would<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.229> more

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
showcase that fro a meet would get more

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.949 
showcase that fro a meet would get more
experience<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.399> your<00:02:08.729> affection<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.450> maxed

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
experience if your affection is maxed

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
experience if your affection is maxed
out<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.410> Pokemon<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> me<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> guess<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
out in Pokemon to me but I guess you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.309 
out in Pokemon to me but I guess you
need<00:02:11.760> max<00:02:12.060> affection

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
need max affection

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.759 
need max affection
you<00:02:13.379> get<00:02:14.180> more<00:02:15.180> experience<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.560> boost

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
you get more experience the boost

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.530 
you get more experience the boost
experience<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.790> also<00:02:17.939> don't<00:02:18.209> want<00:02:18.420> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
experience so you also don't want to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.899 
experience so you also don't want to
evolve<00:02:19.049> your<00:02:19.260> Pokemon<00:02:19.650> because<00:02:20.310> if<00:02:20.670> you

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
evolve your Pokemon because if you

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.369 
evolve your Pokemon because if you
evolve<00:02:21.269> your<00:02:21.389> Pokemon<00:02:21.780> you're<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.049> gonna<00:02:22.170> get

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
evolve your Pokemon you're not gonna get

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.050 
evolve your Pokemon you're not gonna get
that<00:02:22.409> boosted<00:02:22.829> experience<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.670> example

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
that boosted experience so for example

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.239 
that boosted experience so for example
let's<00:02:24.269> say<00:02:24.359> you<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.139> froakie<00:02:25.889> at<00:02:25.980> level<00:02:26.219> of

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:26.249 
let's say you have a froakie at level of

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.949 
let's say you have a froakie at level of
50<00:02:26.579> he's<00:02:26.760> gonna<00:02:26.909> get<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> boost<00:02:27.450> experience

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
50 he's gonna get the boost experience

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.509 
50 he's gonna get the boost experience
but<00:02:28.139> if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.319> have<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.439> greninja<00:02:28.769> at<00:02:28.950> level<00:02:29.219> 50

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
but if you have a greninja at level 50

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.330 
but if you have a greninja at level 50
it's<00:02:30.269> not<00:02:30.569> gonna<00:02:30.780> get<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.230> pre<00:02:31.650> evolution

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
it's not gonna get the pre evolution

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.670 
it's not gonna get the pre evolution
boost<00:02:32.639> so<00:02:33.120> froakie<00:02:33.989> would<00:02:34.109> get<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> lot<00:02:34.530> more

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
boost so froakie would get a lot more

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.170 
boost so froakie would get a lot more
experience<00:02:34.950> than<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> greninja<00:02:35.670> which<00:02:35.939> is<00:02:36.030> what

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
experience than a greninja which is what

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.449 
experience than a greninja which is what
I'm<00:02:36.269> basically<00:02:36.510> trying<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> say<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:38.099> I'm

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
I'm basically trying to say so now I'm

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
this took around 15 minutes real time to

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.629 
this took around 15 minutes real time to
