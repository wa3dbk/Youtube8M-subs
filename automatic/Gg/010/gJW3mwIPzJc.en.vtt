hey guys this is tech Tuesday and today
we're<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.449> take<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.689> look<00:00:03.959> at<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.380> xbox

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
we're going to take a look at the xbox

you've heard it called it's called the
xbox<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.349> we're<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> compare<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
xbox one and we're going to compare it

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
xbox one and we're going to compare it
to<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> ps4<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.750> might<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.139> some<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> these

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
to the ps4 I might do some of these

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589 
to the ps4 I might do some of these
again<00:00:13.830> over<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.700> more<00:00:14.730> details<00:00:15.030> emerge

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
ps4 have discrete central processing

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.479 
ps4 have discrete central processing
units<00:00:29.970> cpus<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:30.929> graphics<00:00:31.679> processing<00:00:32.070> units

and that's called an APU an accelerated

and that's called an APU an accelerated
processing<00:00:38.190> unit<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> same

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
processing unit it's about the same

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.750 
processing unit it's about the same
sometimes<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.680> trade-offs<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.280> made<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
sometimes little trade-offs are made for

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
sometimes little trade-offs are made for
example<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.300> share<00:00:42.660> ram<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.710> by<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.040> large

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
example they share ram but by and large

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000 
example they share ram but by and large
it's<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:45.090> general<00:00:45.510> concept<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.829> you'd

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it's the same general concept now you'd

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's the same general concept now you'd
think<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.340> would<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.610> easy<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> compare

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
think these would be easy to compare

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
think these would be easy to compare
because<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:48.930> both<00:00:49.110> based<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.620> amd's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
because they're both based on amd's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.840 
because they're both based on amd's

thing<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.600> xbox<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.980> bit

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
thing is the xbox one is a little bit

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.700 
thing is the xbox one is a little bit
slower<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.730> operates<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.449> 1.6<00:00:58.410> gigahertz

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
slower it operates at 1.6 gigahertz

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.250 
slower it operates at 1.6 gigahertz
where<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> ps4<00:00:59.820> operates<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.809> two

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
where is the ps4 operates at two

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.520 
where is the ps4 operates at two
gigahertz<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:02.430> notable<00:01:03.000> speed<00:01:03.270> increased<00:01:03.840> but

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gigahertz my notable speed increased but

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
gigahertz my notable speed increased but
there's<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.920> complication<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.090> than

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there's more complication to it than

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.310 
there's more complication to it than
just<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.470> Xbox<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> fed<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.320> ddr3

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
just that the Xbox one is fed by ddr3

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.580 
just that the Xbox one is fed by ddr3
memory<00:01:10.590> while<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> ps4<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.150> fed<00:01:12.450> by<00:01:12.630> ddr5

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
memory one the ddr3 is better at

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
memory one the ddr3 is better at
supplying<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> CPU<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> really

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
supplying the CPU with what it really

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
supplying the CPU with what it really
needs<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.610> better<00:01:20.939> at

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
needs and the other is better at

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
needs and the other is better at

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
supplying the graphics unit with what it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
supplying the graphics unit with what it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
really needs so which one's better

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.460 
really needs so which one's better
probably<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> ps4<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.509> operates<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> higher

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
probably the ps4 it operates at a higher

good on the Xbox side they haven't
released<00:02:03.750> their<00:02:04.290> specs<00:02:04.530> yet<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.399> don't

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
released their specs yet so we don't

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.510 
released their specs yet so we don't
know<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.570> some<00:02:06.840> other<00:02:07.020> stuff

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
know but we do know some other stuff

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.869 
know but we do know some other stuff
over<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> ps4<00:02:09.619> there's<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.830> ddr5<00:02:11.550> ram

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
over on the ps4 there's that ddr5 ram

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.640 
over on the ps4 there's that ddr5 ram
again<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.450> ddr5<00:02:13.050> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
again the ddr5 is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770 
again the ddr5 is
really<00:02:13.829> well<00:02:14.040> suited<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.780> graphics

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
really well suited to graphics

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.589 
really well suited to graphics
processing<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.090> performance<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599

we can get over there it's going to have
a<00:02:19.980> natural<00:02:20.400> advantage<00:02:20.849> if<00:02:21.030> xbox<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
a natural advantage if xbox is going to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.130 
a natural advantage if xbox is going to
outperform<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.890> ps4<00:02:23.159> then<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.659> architecture

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140

on<00:02:39.450> there<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.989> esram<00:02:40.439> is<00:02:40.769> quick<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.340> snappy

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
on there the esram is quick it's snappy

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.330 
on there the esram is quick it's snappy
and<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.569> fully<00:02:43.019> devoted<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.859> graphics

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and it's fully devoted to the graphics

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.569 
and it's fully devoted to the graphics
processing<00:02:44.790> unit<00:02:45.290> unlike<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.680> system<00:02:47.370> Ram

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.430 
processing unit unlike the system Ram
that's<00:02:48.030> being<00:02:48.299> shared<00:02:48.389> by<00:02:48.840> everything<00:02:49.139> else

that's being shared by everything else

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.530 
that's being shared by everything else
so<00:02:49.799> both<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.069> these<00:02:50.340> come<00:02:50.579> with<00:02:50.609> 8<00:02:51.030> gigabyte

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so both of these come with 8 gigabyte

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.819 
so both of these come with 8 gigabyte
yeah<00:02:52.230> 8<00:02:52.379> gigabytes<00:02:52.859> of<00:02:53.359> system<00:02:54.359> ram<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.319> only

yeah 8 gigabytes of system ram but only

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.940 
yeah 8 gigabytes of system ram but only
the<00:02:55.950> Xbox<00:02:56.549> has<00:02:56.819> 32<00:02:57.329> megabytes<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:58.049> dedicated

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
performance specs that have come out we

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.559 
performance specs that have come out we
don't<00:03:14.250> even<00:03:14.489> know<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.700> architecture<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.480> the

don't even know the architecture on the
Xbox<00:03:15.930> one<00:03:16.260> side<00:03:16.470> they've<00:03:16.920> kept<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.430> secret

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
Xbox one side they've kept it a secret

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.210 
Xbox one side they've kept it a secret
so<00:03:17.849> far<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:18.900> until<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.410> thing<00:03:19.560> comes<00:03:19.829> out<00:03:20.010> and

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
so far so until the thing comes out and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.400 
so far so until the thing comes out and
they<00:03:20.639> start<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.329> benchmarking<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.049> then

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
they start you know benchmarking it then

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.559 
they start you know benchmarking it then
we<00:03:22.560> won't<00:03:22.769> know<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.010> sure<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.209> time<00:03:24.449> to

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
we won't know for sure but it's time to

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.089 
we won't know for sure but it's time to
talk<00:03:24.750> more<00:03:24.989> about<00:03:25.049> ran<00:03:25.470> because<00:03:25.709> we've<00:03:25.919> just

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
talk more about ran because we've just

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.360 
talk more about ran because we've just
been<00:03:26.220> alluding<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:28.049> let's<00:03:28.260> talk<00:03:28.470> ddr3

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
been alluding to it so let's talk ddr3

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.099 
been alluding to it so let's talk ddr3
versus<00:03:30.060> ddr5<00:03:31.459> ddr3<00:03:32.459> has<00:03:32.790> low<00:03:33.120> latency<00:03:33.930> which

versus ddr5 ddr3 has low latency which

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.409 
versus ddr5 ddr3 has low latency which
means<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.190> moment<00:03:35.699> that<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.030> want<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
means that the moment that you want the

it quickly ddr5 has high bandwidth which

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.180 
it quickly ddr5 has high bandwidth which

the performance victor here it's looking

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.260 
the performance victor here it's looking
like<00:05:04.500> it's<00:05:04.740> just<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.130> tiny<00:05:05.370> bit<00:05:05.520> faster<00:05:06.120> than

like it's just a tiny bit faster than

the<00:05:06.390> Xbox<00:05:06.900> based<00:05:07.590> on<00:05:07.860> hardware<00:05:08.610> alone<00:05:09.120> but

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
the Xbox based on hardware alone but

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.480 
the Xbox based on hardware alone but
there's<00:05:09.810> more<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.350> equation<00:05:10.710> than<00:05:11.070> just

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
there's more to the equation than just

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.000 
there's more to the equation than just
that<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:12.210> Xbox<00:05:12.690> has<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.930> secret<00:05:13.260> advantage<00:05:13.860> and

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
that the Xbox has a secret advantage and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.320 
that the Xbox has a secret advantage and
it's<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.730> it<00:05:14.910> runs<00:05:15.210> windows<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:16.350> here's<00:05:16.980> why

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
it's that it runs windows so here's why

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.460 
it's that it runs windows so here's why
so<00:05:18.330> when<00:05:18.480> a<00:05:18.510> developer<00:05:18.780> is<00:05:19.110> writing<00:05:19.410> a

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
system talks to the hardware there's a

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.570 
system talks to the hardware there's a

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
little more to it than that but just

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.810 
little more to it than that but just
work<00:06:05.820> with<00:06:06.000> me<00:06:06.030> here<00:06:06.230> over<00:06:07.230> on<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.470> ps4<00:06:07.830> they

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
work with me here over on the ps4 they

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.790 
work with me here over on the ps4 they
have<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.150> same<00:06:09.540> level<00:06:09.810> of<00:06:10.050> software<00:06:10.590> and

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
have that same level of software and

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.650 
have that same level of software and
then<00:06:11.190> that<00:06:11.400> has<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.730> go<00:06:11.850> through<00:06:12.090> some<00:06:12.330> sort<00:06:12.480> of

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
then that has to go through some sort of

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.540 
then that has to go through some sort of
abstraction<00:06:13.380> layer<00:06:13.590> it<00:06:13.800> has<00:06:13.950> to<00:06:14.100> have<00:06:14.250> some

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
abstraction layer it has to have some

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.720 
abstraction layer it has to have some
sort<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.910> extra<00:06:15.330> thing<00:06:15.570> written<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.620> make<00:06:17.370> the

sort of extra thing written to make the

sort of extra thing written to make the
ps4<00:06:18.120> behave<00:06:18.900> like<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:19.440> other<00:06:19.680> platforms

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
ps4 behave like the other platforms

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.460 
ps4 behave like the other platforms
that's<00:06:20.700> normally<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.210> way<00:06:21.480> that<00:06:21.720> software<00:06:22.169> is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
that's normally the way that software is

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.409 
that's normally the way that software is
written<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.130> that's<00:06:23.430> not<00:06:23.610> just<00:06:23.669> games<00:06:24.120> thats

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
written and that's not just games thats

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.510 
written and that's not just games thats
everywhere<00:06:24.870> so<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.740> software<00:06:26.160> talked<00:06:26.400> to

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
everywhere so the software talked to

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.220 
everywhere so the software talked to
this<00:06:26.610> abstraction<00:06:27.150> layer<00:06:27.480> so<00:06:27.720> that<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:27.990> same

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
this abstraction layer so that the same

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.500 
this abstraction layer so that the same
calls<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.919> same<00:06:29.130> application<00:06:30.120> programming

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
calls the same application programming

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.060 
calls the same application programming

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
goes through that abstraction layer it

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.010 
goes through that abstraction layer it
talks<00:06:38.370> to<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.700> operating<00:06:39.240> system<00:06:39.570> and<00:06:39.780> then

talks to the operating system and then

talks to the operating system and then
it<00:06:40.260> talks<00:06:40.530> to<00:06:40.710> the
