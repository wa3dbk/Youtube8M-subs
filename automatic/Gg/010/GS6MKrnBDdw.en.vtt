00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
sup guys in this tutorial I'm gonna

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.700 
sup guys in this tutorial I'm gonna
making<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:04.220> 60s<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.609> 70s<00:00:05.790> aggressive<00:00:06.720> organ

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
making a 60s and 70s aggressive organ

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.650 
making a 60s and 70s aggressive organ
sound<00:00:08.010> um<00:00:08.370> there's<00:00:08.730> no<00:00:08.880> tutorial<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.540> how<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
sound um there's no tutorial on how to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.740 
sound um there's no tutorial on how to
do<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.219> but<00:00:11.219> there<00:00:11.460> should<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.599> am

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
do this but there should be so here I am

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.890 
do this but there should be so here I am
hi<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.370> how<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.150> an<00:00:15.240> organ<00:00:15.480> sound<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
hi so how you make an organ sound is you

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.820 
hi so how you make an organ sound is you
basically<00:00:16.049> stack<00:00:17.039> sine<00:00:17.520> waves<00:00:18.710> which<00:00:19.710> are

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
basically stack sine waves which are

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.420 
basically stack sine waves which are
these<00:00:19.980> things

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
these things

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.420 
these things
there's<00:00:20.699> squigglies<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.740> will<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
there's squigglies and will do that so I

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.240 
there's squigglies and will do that so I
have<00:00:23.609> three<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.449> they'll<00:00:25.350> they're<00:00:25.680> all<00:00:25.859> kind

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
have three and they'll they're all kind

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.259 
have three and they'll they're all kind
of<00:00:26.599> detuned<00:00:27.599> from<00:00:27.900> each<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> that's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
of detuned from each other so that's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.870 
of detuned from each other so that's
already<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:33.260> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> cool<00:00:34.880> organ

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
already that's a kind of a cool organ

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.709 
already that's a kind of a cool organ
sound<00:00:36.590> sounds<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.640> organic<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.540> all

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sound sounds really not organic at all

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
sound sounds really not organic at all
but<00:00:40.710> will<00:00:40.800> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> fix<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.879> I'm<00:00:41.940> gonna

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but will kind of fix that so I'm gonna

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.920 
but will kind of fix that so I'm gonna
just<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:43.789> attack<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.360> give<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> bit<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
just the attack I can give it a bit of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.670 
just the attack I can give it a bit of
release<00:00:50.719> view<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> cool<00:00:52.649> for

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
release view this is kind of cool for

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.880 
release view this is kind of cool for
you<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:54.059> know

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
you you know

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.180 
you you know
relaxation<00:00:55.890> music<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> guys<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> what

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
relaxation music kind of guys so what

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
relaxation music kind of guys so what
are<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> gonna<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.670> need<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.710> modulate

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
are you gonna do you need to modulate

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
are you gonna do you need to modulate
the<00:01:01.890> pan<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> goes<00:01:02.850> left<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.239> right<00:01:03.480> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the pan so it goes left and right this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.460 
the pan so it goes left and right this
simulates<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.170> Leslie<00:01:04.650> speaker<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> gives

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
simulates a Leslie speaker and it gives

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.810 
simulates a Leslie speaker and it gives
it<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.860> movement<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> hear

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it a bit more movement if you can hear

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
it a bit more movement if you can hear
them<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.659> we're<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.110> go

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
them right so from there we're gonna go

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.390 
them right so from there we're gonna go
back<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> add<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> ring

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
back I'm going to add a bit of ring

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.840 
back I'm going to add a bit of ring
modulation<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> adds<00:01:22.610> more<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
modulation and this adds more of a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.789 
modulation and this adds more of a
natural<00:01:24.600> tone<00:01:24.900> wheel<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> sound

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.569 

great<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.210> cool

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
great and that's a really really cool

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.929 
great and that's a really really cool
organ<00:01:38.579> sound<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.729> could<00:01:41.729> stop

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
organ sound which I like so I could stop

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520 
organ sound which I like so I could stop
there<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.180> could<00:01:42.479> sorry<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.170> smacking<00:01:43.439> my

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
there I could sorry for smacking my

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.580 
there I could sorry for smacking my
teeth<00:01:43.680> hurt<00:01:44.039> my<00:01:44.250> lips<00:01:44.399> already<00:01:45.179> call<00:01:45.329> them

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
teeth hurt my lips already call them

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
teeth hurt my lips already call them
I'll<00:01:46.590> add<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> delay<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
I'll add a bit of delay and a bit of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
I'll add a bit of delay and a bit of
reverb<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:54.140> wish<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.229> could<00:01:55.380> play<00:01:55.530> um<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.610> yeah

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
reverb I wish I could play um so yeah

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.289 
reverb I wish I could play um so yeah
there's<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:59.179> like<00:02:00.179> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.460 
really cool again it's a really cool
organ<00:02:03.420> sound<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.110> make<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.349> bit

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
organ sound but we can make it a bit

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.850 
organ sound but we can make it a bit
more<00:02:04.500> aggressive<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:05.970> gonna<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.330> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
more aggressive and I'm gonna do that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:43.240 
more aggressive and I'm gonna do that
with<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> drive<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:33.299> travel

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.630 

secured<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> analog<00:02:44.760> boost<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.280> there's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
secured the analog boost and there's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640 
secured the analog boost and there's
that<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.390> we<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.810> use<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> different

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that and we can use a different

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:06.650 
that and we can use a different
distortion<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.490> taste<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.550> there's<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
distortion to taste so there's that and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.150 
distortion to taste so there's that and
there's<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.959> other<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.709> have<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.860> virus

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
there's like other if you have a virus

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.120 
there's like other if you have a virus
there's<00:03:08.400> like<00:03:08.550> special<00:03:09.330> things<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.750> can<00:03:09.930> do

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
there's like special things you can do

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.610 
there's like special things you can do
you<00:03:11.130> know<00:03:11.220> how<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.459> had<00:03:12.060> an<00:03:12.450> LFO<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.320> pan

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you know how we had an LFO for the pan

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.510 
you know how we had an LFO for the pan
we<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.160> actually<00:03:14.370> use<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.420> leslie<00:03:16.520> rotary

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
we can actually use and leslie rotary

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.910 
we can actually use and leslie rotary
speaker<00:03:17.820> which<00:03:18.450> also<00:03:18.720> introduces<00:03:19.530> its<00:03:19.709> own

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
speaker which also introduces its own
