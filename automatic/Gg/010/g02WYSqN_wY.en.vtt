 to destin and in this video we will see a 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 guide to completing the contracts of the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.280
 relics of like in the way of the moon 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.250
 of venus and smarter to do what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.020
 quickly as possible as we against him 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.670
 that can make us a bit heavy on 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 the theme of going to the planet and collecting 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 the relics and let's see the areas 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.820
 where we can do it as fast 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 possible is simple so that it is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 we do not say it right here we see the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 contract starts from Mars in this case 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 collects two hundred tears of Olympus what 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.630
 let's see it all goes the four 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 first contracts relics of the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 cosmÃ³dromo includes sensors 200 mites 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.059
 patrols winds we have to pull 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.350
 with active left and delete 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.510
 those three enemies that are in the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.940
 magazine and go through the tunnel this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 here we continue down and here we 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.890
 we will find the three enemies ultras 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.410
 or greater than the hive that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.180
 yellow facts that are what give us 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 20 mites in this case in charge of the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.600
 land 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.930
 they give us 20 for each one that we eliminate 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.190
 it would be 60 we see it go down one 34 times 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 more or less 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.520
 once we eliminate it we go up to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.720
 above we eliminate the enemies of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.640
 up the top three that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.730
 will reappear we take a little spin 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.470
 2030 seconds or so and we'll go back to 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.160
 come down and these men will be again 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.110
 here I tell you 34 times what we will have 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.480
 completed in 5 minutes we will have it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.080
 ready ok let's go with the next 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.000
 contract that would be the moon 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.310
 against all the relics of the moon 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.260
 travel 200 hits on the moon coming out 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.390
 also of patrols we follow a little 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.070
 forwards it is close and here what 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.460
 we have to eliminate those 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.760
 enemies out here the stingers 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.670
 the fallen the dishonest here 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.800
 Ultras can also appear 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.810
 any one can appear 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.520
 it's not sure how safe they are inside 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.910
 those who are the ones that we will have to 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.890
 kill 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.350
 let's see bring us here we eliminate 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.660
 everything to all the enemies that 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.940
 centers the zones and we're still here here 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.180
 down here below let's find two 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.560
 enemies two older gentlemen or ultras 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.470
 from the hive will also give us 20 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 20 relics from here of the moon what 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.540
 we would eliminate we would have to leave for 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.980
 out eliminate enemies from outside 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.860
 giving a little spin is worth giving 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.510
 time they reappear and 56 times 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.220
 we will have to do it as we see here 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.880
 As I said before, the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.959
 Ultra here and that saved us well 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.980
 well let's go with the next 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 contract that would be in venus is worth that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.930
 it would be relics of Venus collects 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.220
 two hundred threats on menus in coming out 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.500
 of patrol we will continue this way 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.970
 that I'm going to leave it in quick camera for 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.680
 that you see 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.080
 here we can also do it in the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 mission of the file when we have to 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.010
 kill the ball that one that comes with 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.140
 the two gentlemen with the two fallen 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.240
 those seniors but I think that is more 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.040
 quick we will have to leave the mission 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.600
 and so on and up to here it's just 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.820
 wait for the pretoria to come out I do not know 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.350
 what is here in the background the colossus hub 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.960
 link we kill the praetorian of the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.960
 documents that from here and the other one also 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.110
 ok and wait for them to show up here to 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.150
 the right we also see that it can come out 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.730
 where are the harpies are ours 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.230
 to which the man can leave some some 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.740
 harpy of that yellow that would tell us 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.709
 also the 20 the 20 relics that 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.480
 we are looking for we killed the Praetorian and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.000
 we are still worth the next contract 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.760
 delights of Mars collects 200 tears 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.950
 of Olympus also on patrols at the same 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810
 for the left and after the tunnel 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.480
 here in this building is where 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.570
 we will find the cabal ultras or 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.820
 older well let's get into here in 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.360
 where are these these enemies can 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.520
 go out 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.350
 a greater job of their enemies 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.120
 yellows in this case do not come out but if 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.010
 we give a couple of laps three normally 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.200
 they can come out worth as much there as in that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.040
 hallway that we're going to see now can 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 appear them and the one that leaves sure 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.720
 is the one behind this door 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.300
 Valera who is in this room he is going 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.720
 to leave we always have it insured 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.430
 this is torrent of tears we kill him 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.890
 we eliminate this man from that too 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.420
 and we'll have to leave here for the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.359
 little window of this one we throw ourselves for 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.890
 below and here now behind usually 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.530
 appear also some is not always 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.840
 that of random sale that is ultras 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.970
 we eliminated and the day to the fund is equal 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.560
 usually there are also some one or two 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.690
 bars there where those three are 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.640
 may appear one or two that is also not 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.100
 sure but they can appear this is the 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.470
 zone in the fastest area at least 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.300
 I think it came out pretty and because 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.490
 I tell you there at the bottom here in the 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.750
 up stairs will come out this sure 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.340
 and nothing done are 24 contracts the form 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.169
 that I found faster to do it 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.150
 so that we do not become so heavy 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.730
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.570
 to serve you when you have the contract 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.490
 available 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.340
