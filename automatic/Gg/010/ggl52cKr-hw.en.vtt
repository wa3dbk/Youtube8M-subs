of time to rebuild it to hopefully
improve<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.979> last<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.450> maintain

improve it to get it to last or maintain

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.150 
improve it to get it to last or maintain
some<00:02:09.750> semblance<00:02:10.110> of

some semblance of

some semblance of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
time a new concept that is you know the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.160 
time a new concept that is you know the
fad<00:02:19.500> or<00:02:19.530> trend<00:02:20.480> Pluto<00:02:21.480> don't<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.050> it

fad or trend Pluto don't like it it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.550 
fad or trend Pluto don't like it it
destroys<00:02:22.590> those<00:02:23.450> energy<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.750> think<00:02:25.440> about

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
destroys those energy so think about

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.990 
destroys those energy so think about
that<00:02:25.710> as<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.070> move<00:02:26.100> forward<00:02:26.430> that's<00:02:26.700> why<00:02:26.880> I've

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that as we move forward that's why I've

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.530 
that as we move forward that's why I've
talked<00:02:27.330> about<00:02:27.570> gold<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.930> silver<00:02:28.260> forever

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
talked about gold and silver forever

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.120 
talked about gold and silver forever
gold<00:02:30.540> silver<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:31.080> withstood<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> test<00:02:31.920> of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
gold silver have withstood the test of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.610 
gold silver have withstood the test of
time<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> value<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:33.690> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.380> get

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
time as a value and I'm not going to get

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.090 
time as a value and I'm not going to get
into<00:02:34.770> money<00:02:35.100> much<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
into money much here but it's one of the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.250 
into money much here but it's one of the
things<00:02:38.100> I've<00:02:38.970> talked<00:02:39.240> about<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.570> wayanad<00:02:40.050> box

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
things I've talked about in wayanad box

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.040 
things I've talked about in wayanad box
because<00:02:40.470> Pluto<00:02:40.740> beam<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.310> Capricorn<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.810> last

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
because Pluto beam in Capricorn the last

because Pluto beam in Capricorn the last
of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.320> earth<00:02:43.440> signs<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.330> it's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
of the earth signs and now that it's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
of the earth signs and now that it's
it's<00:02:46.050> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.320> square<00:02:46.590> all<00:02:46.740> these<00:02:46.920> planets

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
it's going to square all these planets

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.220 
it's going to square all these planets
for<00:02:47.550> beginnings<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.420> are<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.050> to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
for beginnings we are going to have to

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.060 
for beginnings we are going to have to
address<00:02:49.500> quite<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> bit<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:52.410> we've<00:02:52.830> done

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
address quite a bit of what we've done

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.520 
address quite a bit of what we've done
and<00:02:53.130> how<00:02:53.550> how<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.630> why<00:02:54.750> we've<00:02:54.960> got<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.380> where

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and how how and why we've got to where

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.060 
and how how and why we've got to where
we<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:56.870> that's<00:02:57.870> one<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.320> what<00:02:58.800> we're<00:02:58.890> going<00:02:58.980> to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
we are that's one of what we're going to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.430 
we are that's one of what we're going to
be<00:02:59.100> dealing<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.480> the<00:03:00.480> other<00:03:00.600> thing<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.410> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
be dealing with the other thing which is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320 
be dealing with the other thing which is
gonna<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.740> just<00:03:01.860> as<00:03:02.040> important<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:02.970> my<00:03:03.300> opinion

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
gonna be just as important in my opinion

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.290 
gonna be just as important in my opinion
is<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:05.430> Saturn<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
is going to be that Saturn is going to

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.880 
is going to be that Saturn is going to
be<00:03:06.450> still<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.170> labor<00:03:07.320> if<00:03:07.530> we're<00:03:07.680> dealing<00:03:07.770> with

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
be still in labor if we're dealing with

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.940 
be still in labor if we're dealing with
relationships<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.790> balance<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.360> course<00:03:09.600> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
relationships and balance of course and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.440 
relationships and balance of course and
I've<00:03:10.950> been<00:03:11.100> talking<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.360> is

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
I've been talking about that but it is

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.140 
I've been talking about that but it is
going<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.660> be<00:03:12.690> exactly<00:03:13.440> opposite<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.970> new

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
going to be exactly opposite this new

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.240 
going to be exactly opposite this new
moon<00:03:15.390> at<00:03:15.810> 13<00:03:16.320> degrees<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.920> Libra<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.800> new<00:03:20.010> moon

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
moon at 13 degrees of Libra the new moon

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.330 
moon at 13 degrees of Libra the new moon
and<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.610> Sun<00:03:21.320> Moon<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.350> Sun<00:03:22.620> will<00:03:22.740> be<00:03:22.860> at<00:03:22.950> 13

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
and the Sun Moon and Sun will be at 13

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.040 
and the Sun Moon and Sun will be at 13
degrees<00:03:23.550> Aries<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.209> going<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.420> be<00:03:24.480> exactly

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
degrees Aries it's going to be exactly

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.250 
degrees Aries it's going to be exactly
opposite<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:27.209> anytime<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.810> deal<00:03:28.110> with

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
opposite so anytime we deal with

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.780 
opposite so anytime we deal with
opposition's<00:03:28.830> now<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> stronger<00:03:29.580> we<00:03:29.670> deal

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
opposition's now on a stronger we deal

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.380 
opposition's now on a stronger we deal
with<00:03:29.880> extreme<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:31.170> Pluto<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
with extreme so the Pluto is the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.390 
with extreme so the Pluto is the
transformer<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.620> brings<00:03:34.830> death<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
transformer it brings death and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.740 
transformer it brings death and
destruction<00:03:36.080> for<00:03:37.080> rebirth<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.740> miracles<00:03:38.520> and

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
destruction for rebirth and miracles and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.560 
destruction for rebirth and miracles and
Saturn<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.020> planet<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.330> teacher

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
Saturn is the planet that is the teacher

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.490 
Saturn is the planet that is the teacher
so<00:03:43.560> what<00:03:44.430> happens<00:03:44.760> when<00:03:44.910> Saturn<00:03:45.360> we<00:03:46.140> deal<00:03:46.350> with

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
so what happens when Saturn we deal with

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.650 
so what happens when Saturn we deal with
Saturn<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.610> r<00:03:47.640> restricted<00:03:47.970> we<00:03:48.390> have<00:03:48.540> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
Saturn is we r restricted we have to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.870 
Saturn is we r restricted we have to
learn<00:03:48.840> there's<00:03:49.170> lessons<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.070> we<00:03:50.700> need

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
learn there's lessons here and we need

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.960 
learn there's lessons here and we need
to<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:52.280> say<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.310> right<00:03:53.520> what<00:03:53.700> do<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.910> need

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to really say all right what do I need

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.910 
to really say all right what do I need
to<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.330> that's<00:03:55.110> what<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.380> moon<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.709> going<00:03:55.800> to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
to do that's what this moon is going to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.280 
to do that's what this moon is going to
be<00:03:56.010> all<00:03:56.160> about<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.700> going<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:57.000> about<00:03:57.290> what

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
be all about it's going to be about what

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.130 
be all about it's going to be about what
am<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:59.040> going<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.400> change<00:03:59.820> what<00:04:00.540> am<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.810> going<00:04:01.020> to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
am I going to change what am I going to

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.590 
am I going to change what am I going to
do<00:04:01.260> from<00:04:01.770> my<00:04:01.950> perspective<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.700> will<00:04:02.940> not<00:04:03.209> walk
