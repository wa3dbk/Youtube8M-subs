00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
is when they made 360 they should have

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
is when they made 360 they should have
put<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> same<00:01:12.600> graphics<00:01:13.200> chip<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.799> that

the<00:01:14.159> original<00:01:14.369> Xbox<00:01:15.090> head<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the original Xbox head and that way you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
the original Xbox head and that way you
could<00:01:16.740> play<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.189> old<00:01:17.340> games<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> see

the<00:01:18.840> thing<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.650> had<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.009> emulate<00:01:20.549> all

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the thing was they had to emulate all

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
the thing was they had to emulate all
the<00:01:21.210> old<00:01:21.240> xbox<00:01:21.780> games<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.920> playable

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the old xbox games and they can playable

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.499 
the old xbox games and they can playable
on<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> 360<00:01:25.159> but<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> would<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.610> nice<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:26.939> every

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
on the 360 but it would be nice if every

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.010 
on the 360 but it would be nice if every
single<00:01:27.990> xbox<00:01:28.470> game<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:29.159> playable<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.880> 360<00:01:30.810> but

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
single xbox game was playable on 360 but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
single xbox game was playable on 360 but
it<00:01:31.890> looks<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> happen

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it looks like it's not going to happen

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.289 
it looks like it's not going to happen
anytime<00:01:33.780> soon<00:01:33.990> unless<00:01:34.790> Microsoft<00:01:35.790> gets<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
anytime soon unless Microsoft gets to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.990 
anytime soon unless Microsoft gets to
making<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:36.869> more<00:01:37.110> patches<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.579> old

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
making some more patches for these old

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.609 
making some more patches for these old
original<00:01:39.360> xbox<00:01:40.170> games<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.970> uh<00:01:42.079> I'm<00:01:43.079> hoping

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
original xbox games and uh I'm hoping

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.889 
original xbox games and uh I'm hoping
maybe<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.280> pass<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.790> around<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.689> get

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
maybe if we pass this around and get

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.160 
maybe if we pass this around and get
enough<00:01:46.170> signatures<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.250> petition<00:01:47.310> here

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
enough signatures on this petition here

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
enough signatures on this petition here
Microsoft<00:01:49.170> will<00:01:49.409> finally<00:01:49.920> take<00:01:50.430> into

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
Microsoft will finally take into

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149 
Microsoft will finally take into
consideration<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.619> should<00:01:52.890> bring

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
consideration that they should bring

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
consideration that they should bring
back<00:01:53.189> backwards<00:01:53.790> compatibility<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.930> their

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
back backwards compatibility for their

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
back backwards compatibility for their
fans<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.680> mean<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> least

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
fans I mean I think that's the least

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.840 
fans I mean I think that's the least
they<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.899> fans<00:01:58.170> considering
