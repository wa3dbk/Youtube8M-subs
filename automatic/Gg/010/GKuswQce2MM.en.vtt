00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.550 

this<00:02:24.349> also<00:02:24.680> applies<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.190> swimming<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.560> before

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
this also applies to swimming as before

normal turning speed the later circles

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.120 
normal turning speed the later circles
is<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.019> turning<00:02:39.319> speed<00:02:39.380> while<00:02:39.709> holding<00:02:39.950> are

as<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:47.390> would<00:02:47.480> expect<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:48.290> gives<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.739> lot

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
as you would expect this gives you a lot

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.819 
as you would expect this gives you a lot
more<00:02:49.220> freedom<00:02:49.579> while<00:02:49.970> flying<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.450> swimming

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
more freedom while flying and swimming

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.780 
more freedom while flying and swimming
here's<00:02:51.829> an<00:02:51.980> example<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.549> what's<00:02:52.700> possible

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
here's an example of what's possible

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:06.770 
here's an example of what's possible
with<00:02:53.209> swimming<00:02:53.450> while<00:02:53.690> holding<00:02:54.049> our

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:18.640 

you

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.440 

this<00:03:19.650> area<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.220> high<00:03:20.490> enough<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.790> cause<00:03:21.120> fall

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
this area is high enough to cause fall

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.660 
this area is high enough to cause fall
damage<00:03:24.260> while<00:03:25.260> there<00:03:25.470> are<00:03:25.590> obviously<00:03:26.190> ways<00:03:26.490> to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
damage while there are obviously ways to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.490 
damage while there are obviously ways to
prevent<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.240> one<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.170> lesser-known

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
prevent this one of the lesser-known

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.160 
prevent this one of the lesser-known
ways<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.520> use<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.880> Beek<00:03:30.090> busts<00:03:30.570> recoil

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
ways is to use the Beek busts recoil

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:40.720 
ways is to use the Beek busts recoil
which<00:03:32.010> grants<00:03:32.370> invincibility<00:03:32.970> until<00:03:33.660> landing

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.850 

this<00:03:41.730> prevents<00:03:42.209> fall<00:03:42.390> damage<00:03:42.780> from<00:03:43.260> virtually

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
this prevents fall damage from virtually

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:53.410 
this prevents fall damage from virtually
any<00:03:44.070> height

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.390 

this<00:03:54.420> invincibility<00:03:55.079> also<00:03:55.829> works<00:03:56.040> against

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
this invincibility also works against

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.000 
this invincibility also works against
enemies<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.060> projectiles<00:03:57.799> such<00:03:58.799> as

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
enemies and projectiles such as

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:10.179 
enemies and projectiles such as
gruntilda's<00:03:59.579> homing<00:03:59.970> attack

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.800 

by<00:04:11.189> combining<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:12.000> ability<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.540> cancel

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
by combining the ability to cancel
