00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
pattern on them that looks like like a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.609 
pattern on them that looks like like a
copperhead<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.360> something<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
copperhead or something like that and

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:20.109 
copperhead or something like that and
they<00:01:14.509> they<00:01:15.509> go<00:01:15.689> into<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:17.090> serpentine<00:01:18.830> posture

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
they they go into a serpentine posture

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.560

when<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:22.490> when<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.670> play<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
when you when you play with them a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
when you when you play with them a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
little bit as you can see he's just kind

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.140 
little bit as you can see he's just kind
of<00:01:27.210> faking<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> strike<00:01:28.200> he's<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.710> really

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
of faking that strike he's not really

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
of faking that strike he's not really
doing<00:01:30.150> anything<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> dangerous<00:01:31.650> he's

really<00:01:33.570> mess<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.750> him<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:35.210> what<00:01:36.210> they'll

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really mess with him a lot what they'll

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.560 
really mess with him a lot what they'll
do<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.920> they'll<00:01:38.340> turn<00:01:38.610> over<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.150> their<00:01:39.329> belly

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
do is they'll turn over on their belly

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:49.160 
do is they'll turn over on their belly
and<00:01:40.490> play<00:01:41.490> dead<00:01:45.619> like<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.390> he<00:01:48.390> goes<00:01:48.600> into<00:01:48.869> his

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and play dead like that he goes into his

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.429 
and play dead like that he goes into his
dead<00:01:49.439> play<00:01:49.799> zone<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.509> he<00:01:51.720> throws<00:01:51.990> his<00:01:52.170> mouth

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
dead play zone and he throws his mouth

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.020 
dead play zone and he throws his mouth
wide<00:01:52.740> open<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.399> he<00:01:53.460> looks<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:54.350> he<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.380> died

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
wide open and he looks like he just died

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.780 
wide open and he looks like he just died
and<00:01:57.469> they'll<00:01:58.469> play<00:01:58.710> dead<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.490> until

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and they'll play dead like that until

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.560 
and they'll play dead like that until
you<00:01:59.850> leave

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you leave

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
you leave
and<00:02:01.070> then<00:02:02.070> they'll<00:02:04.159> they'll<00:02:05.159> flip<00:02:05.399> over<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and then they'll they'll flip over and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.809 
and then they'll they'll flip over and
crawl<00:02:06.149> away<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.069> guess<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.670> they

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
crawl away and I guess that's what they

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.720 
crawl away and I guess that's what they
do<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.140> Hawk<00:02:10.140> gets<00:02:10.440> after<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.280> some<00:02:11.489> kind

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
do if Hawk gets after them or some kind

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.070 
do if Hawk gets after them or some kind
of<00:02:11.790> an<00:02:11.940> animal<00:02:12.300> that's<00:02:12.450> really<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> eat

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
of an animal that's really going to eat

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.960 
of an animal that's really going to eat
them<00:02:13.200> up

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
them up

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.479 
them up
they<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.660> turn<00:02:15.900> over<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.349> play<00:02:16.590> dead<00:02:16.620> and

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.720 

there<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:21.450> one<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.080> about<00:02:22.700> two<00:02:23.700> feet

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
got that short stubby tail that makes

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.220 
got that short stubby tail that makes
him<00:02:34.200> look<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:35.660> really<00:02:36.980> venomous<00:02:38.569> monster

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.460 

what<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.260> found<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.920> those<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:48.470> they're
