00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
grass being cut and all of a sudden you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
grass being cut and all of a sudden you
have<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.450> signs<00:01:48.780> telling<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.560> tree<00:01:49.979> tree

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
have these signs telling you tree tree

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.530 
have these signs telling you tree tree
leaf<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.890> an<00:01:53.159> unnecessary<00:01:54.090> amount<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
leaf it's just an unnecessary amount of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
leaf it's just an unnecessary amount of
information<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.740> wanted<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> point

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
information so I kind of wanted to point

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.230 
information so I kind of wanted to point
to<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.299> competing<00:01:58.259> desire<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:59.240> experience

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to this competing desire for experience

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
to this competing desire for experience
and<00:02:00.390> information

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and information

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.530 
and information
all<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.130> information<00:02:03.370> there<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.000> accurate

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
all the information there is accurate

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.660 
all the information there is accurate
but<00:02:04.720> i<00:02:04.750> guess<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.380> signs<00:02:05.680> themselves<00:02:06.430> where

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
but i guess the signs themselves where

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.050 
but i guess the signs themselves where
they're<00:02:06.850> pointing<00:02:07.420> are<00:02:07.660> meant<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.860> also<00:02:09.520> kind

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
they're pointing are meant to also kind

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.430 
they're pointing are meant to also kind
of<00:02:10.149> confuse<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.110> misdirect<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:13.080> ones<00:02:14.080> that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
of confuse and misdirect the ones that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.170 
of confuse and misdirect the ones that
actually<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.070> lot<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.430> information<00:02:16.060> on

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
actually have a lot of information on

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.480 
actually have a lot of information on
them<00:02:16.390> they're<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.960> didactics<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.950> actually

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
them they're the didactics that actually

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.340 
them they're the didactics that actually
tell<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.910> something<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.600> useful<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.260> I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
tell you something that's useful and I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.320 
tell you something that's useful and I
like<00:02:20.590> both<00:02:21.100> how<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.460> look<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.120> they're

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
like both how they look and that they're

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.480 
like both how they look and that they're
mixed<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.170> signs<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.100> seemed

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
mixed in with the signs that seemed

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.140 
mixed in with the signs that seemed
utterly<00:02:24.610> unnecessary<00:02:26.730> there's<00:02:27.730> one<00:02:27.940> area

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
utterly unnecessary there's one area

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.820 
utterly unnecessary there's one area
that's<00:02:28.360> called<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.720> clearing<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.590> kind

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
that's called the clearing and it's kind

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.010 
that's called the clearing and it's kind
of<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.010> roundabout<00:02:30.460> where<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.510> walk<00:02:31.780> up

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
of a roundabout where you walk up

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.510 
of a roundabout where you walk up
through<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> path<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> distance<00:02:33.190> you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
through a path and in the distance you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.449 
through a path and in the distance you
see<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.209> clumps<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.840> signs<00:02:35.250> pointing<00:02:36.250> all

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
see kind of clumps of signs pointing all

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.010 
see kind of clumps of signs pointing all
different<00:02:36.970> directions<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.660> scale<00:02:37.959> of

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
different directions and the scale of

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.170 
different directions and the scale of
the<00:02:38.320> signs<00:02:38.560> are<00:02:38.830> quite<00:02:39.040> large<00:02:39.280> they're<00:02:39.700> all<00:02:39.850> in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the signs are quite large they're all in

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.490 
the signs are quite large they're all in
the<00:02:40.330> shapes<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.750> arrows<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.380> they're

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the shapes of arrows and they're

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.860 
the shapes of arrows and they're
pointing<00:02:42.040> left<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.940> rioted<00:02:43.360> straight<00:02:43.660> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
pointing left and rioted straight and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.810 
pointing left and rioted straight and
back<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.650> they're<00:02:44.800> all<00:02:44.980> blank<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.640> there's

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
back and they're all blank so there's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.910 
back and they're all blank so there's
kind<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.320> indicating<00:02:47.320> they<00:02:47.440> should<00:02:47.650> walk

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
kind of indicating they should walk

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.790 
kind of indicating they should walk
around<00:02:48.640> every<00:02:49.600> which<00:02:49.750> way<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.840> next<00:02:53.350> kind<00:02:53.650> of

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
around every which way the next kind of

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.420 
around every which way the next kind of
third<00:02:54.630> significant<00:02:55.630> clump<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.230> an<00:02:57.010> area<00:02:57.310> by

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
third significant clump is an area by

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.660 
third significant clump is an area by
the<00:02:57.459> visitors<00:02:57.940> center<00:02:58.209> and<00:02:58.690> there's<00:02:59.670> little

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
the visitors center and there's little

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.940 
the visitors center and there's little
signs<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.480> are<00:03:01.600> all<00:03:01.750> pointing<00:03:02.170> towards<00:03:02.830> the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
signs that are all pointing towards the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.320 
signs that are all pointing towards the
ground<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.430> I've<00:03:03.550> been<00:03:03.760> thinking<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.209> these

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
ground and I've been thinking of these

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.540 
ground and I've been thinking of these
as<00:03:04.390> chickadees<00:03:04.989> or<00:03:05.260> baby<00:03:05.530> signs<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.400> have

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
as chickadees or baby signs that have

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.580 
as chickadees or baby signs that have
not<00:03:06.790> yet<00:03:06.850> grown<00:03:07.300> into<00:03:07.780> larger<00:03:08.140> full-grown

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
not yet grown into larger full-grown

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.810 
not yet grown into larger full-grown
signs<00:03:09.750> these<00:03:10.750> signs<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.950> project<00:03:12.610> are

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
signs these signs in this project are

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.420 
signs these signs in this project are
something<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.330> we<00:03:13.510> see<00:03:13.930> every<00:03:13.959> day<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
something that we see every day the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.460 
something that we see every day the
structure<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.450> familiar<00:03:16.750> but<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
structure is so familiar but then the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.620 
structure is so familiar but then the
content<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.190> different<00:03:18.610> whether<00:03:18.820> its<00:03:19.090> absence

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
content is different whether its absence

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.690 
content is different whether its absence
of<00:03:19.750> content<00:03:20.290> whether<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.100> blank<00:03:21.400> sign

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
of content whether it's a blank sign

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.640 
of content whether it's a blank sign
that<00:03:22.060> allows<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.600> viewer<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.049> just<00:03:23.230> project

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
that allows it viewer to just project

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.280 
that allows it viewer to just project
onto<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.310> their<00:03:24.489> own<00:03:24.670> ideas<00:03:25.150> or<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.080> sign

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
onto it their own ideas or it's a sign

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.250 
onto it their own ideas or it's a sign
that<00:03:26.320> has<00:03:26.680> text<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:28.989> again

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
that has text that is you know again

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.800 
that has text that is you know again
utterly<00:03:29.680> unnecessary<00:03:30.600> hopefully<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
utterly unnecessary hopefully the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.830 
utterly unnecessary hopefully the
familiarity<00:03:32.320> with<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:33.010> structure<00:03:33.880> allows

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
familiarity with that structure allows

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.289 
familiarity with that structure allows
people<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.320> enter<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.160> then<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.940> kind<00:03:37.209> of

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
people to enter it and then it kind of

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.360 
people to enter it and then it kind of
subverts<00:03:37.900> their<00:03:38.200> understanding<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.100> what's

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
subverts their understanding of what's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.960 
subverts their understanding of what's
being<00:03:39.790> indicated<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.080> marked

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
