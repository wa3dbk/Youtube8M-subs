00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.150
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.760
 with all the sports information in 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.420
 morning newscast weekend 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.789
 gentlemen and the bomb rang yesterday with the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.750
 striped monterrey and pacifier soother 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.690
 which says that in 2013 the team is leaving 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.000
 but let's go with the full report of 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.890
 surprise way humberto suazo announced 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.390
 this Friday that will not continue with the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.489
 scratched at the end of the next 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.559
 season the pacifier said they are 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.899
 you break the negotiations with the directive 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.969
 for a possible extension of the agreement 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.949
 Suazo said that somehow has 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.019
 influenced the uncertainty of knowing if 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.290
 will continue or not in the performance that has 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:51.990
 offered this tournament at the time 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:56.770
 he shouted seriously clear that if we got out of this 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.630
 and with the people nothing of outside more by him 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.700
 by how 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.420
 in frustration like I'm playing but 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.410
 I think I thought it well the best thing was to go 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 to the dressing room because I did not want more stir 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.549
 being in the bank 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.670
 there was no despair at all if I have 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.799
 pending because I have also in the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 theme that if I'm not going to stay I'm not going to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.729
 arrive with many things that are 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.219
 going through the head so for that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.649
 yes yes I am a little worried but 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.390
 but I understand the situation I hope 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.270
 improve the montesco their images of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.759
 church guerrero tomás lópez newscast 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.319
 and after leaving with an injury in the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.090
 lower back in the match 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.979
 against tijuana the Brazilian defender 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.530
 juninho work in confined spaces 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 with the rest of his teammates and could 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 return to toluca the player was already 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.840
 submitted to imaging studies and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.569
 it only has some fibers 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.430
 broken muscles in case of not being able 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.140
 play would be replaced by the rivas 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.910
 Enrique Meza pointed out his arrival at the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.830
 city that sees tigers as a team 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.860
 dangerous but trusts to take a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.550
 positive result of the volcano 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.200
 very interesting because because tigers is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.270
 a team that plays very well 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.360
 true is that lately they have not 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.150
 could win but that does not take away the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.700
 dangers not only do we know very well not 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.160
 only for work year after year 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.370
 but why we play with them makes a 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.590
 little time in preseason like 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.830
 our transmissions there are no other 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.830
 we are the numbers we are not the only ones 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:57.770

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.300

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.400
 imposed 2 for 1 on the roosters how well in 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.040
 the 62 gave him the one of the white roosters 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.980
 in 77 the luis gabriel king and would write down 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.020
 that of the equalized and in the 89 ephraim 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.660
 cuts with an own goal ahead of the 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.840
 jaguars and thus closed the score 2 to 1 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.550
 in his favor in this match against the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.520

 matías britos the double of honor 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.680
 and we see it on screen and in 78 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.580
 joao rojas would return to close the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.020
 score 3 for 1 in favor of morelia las 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.310
