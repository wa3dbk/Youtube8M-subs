00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.959
 I'm gay blake obviously and I'm pleased 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.959
 announce that 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.080
 since we are already a million in the channel 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.849
 my side 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.030
 two 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.900
 think and a city submerged between 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.450
 Waters out of the sun does not come with its 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.390
 knots some call it promised land 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.010
 real railcar idea the rap I had but not 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.840
 always look for progress is good and 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.000
 babies progress is measured by loading 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.350
 poison sometimes no brakes all else fails 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.970
 everything is there becomes the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.460
 discounts from the mind of Andrew Ryan 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.010
 here the rules of the exterior do not exist 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.420
 a world where people sowed terror 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.880
 thing is to do the normal thing that you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.460
 astonishment and gods nor kings only man 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.600
 looking for the scientific breakthrough 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.030
 we got in the dance that nobody 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 can say that it is not moral and little 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.200
 ethical the genetic development of the one who does not 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.690
 it sounds good he had an easier life 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.880
 and that if they respected going up and for your 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.709
 be able to recover the free market where 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.420
 what is yours is your life in someone else much 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.490
 better than in your count city this 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.500
 fantastic place where everything is for the best 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.570
 I put that anyone could call it a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.760
 Eden but when selfishness derives in 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.770
 tyranny the revolution arises from the hands of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.480
 the rebel 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.310
 and what little is preserved is plagued 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 of being the one who is looking for a life of 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.360
 those who have addicts cling 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.370
 strong as a boa constrictor or get out 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.440
 undefeated as a camera well I do not care 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.390
 against whom irÃºn after his concession what 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.430
 I know what tenenbaums already of alone and sad 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 return this error that threatens the psyche 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.210
 the cisterns I have my plastics and asses 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.890
 that the failures and you I do not fall and 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.360
 peeling an electro ray and if you hurry me 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.190
 is the money with a snap of fingers 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.140
 Of course I have you but I am stronger 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.790
 with fear be like an English villain in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.070
 another meter or a clueless knockout 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.750
 the head of those steve codes happened to them 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.340
 through the halls both in the two ferrari 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.140
 already attacked without compassion if I find 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.940
 with humility and between cameras dark 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.040
 city 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.230
 but when selfishness derives in the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.880
 tyranny the revolution arises from the hands of 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.940
 the rebellion 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.770
 how little is preserved is plagued 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.660
 of beings that dwell looking for a pinch of 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.850
 that that has addicts cling 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.830
 strong as a boa constrictor or get out 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.600
 undefeated everything will end well I do not care 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.670
 against whom and not a transfer with three 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.650
 I do not know what tenembaun is done alone and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.930
 sad to see the terror that threatens 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.700
 licenses I have you seen together and I swear 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.870
 that we go and simple do not deceive me and 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.870
 peeling the rays
