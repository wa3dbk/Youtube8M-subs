00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.390 
headers so I'm going to turn this a
little<00:03:36.450> bit<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:36.930> reach<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.980> value

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
little bit so I can reach the the value

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400 
little bit so I can reach the the value
here<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.880> you'll<00:03:39.300> see<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.720> sorted<00:03:40.230> them

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
here and you'll see that I sorted them

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.580 
here and you'll see that I sorted them
from<00:03:40.890> lowest<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.550> highest<00:03:41.880> or<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.260> tap<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
from lowest to highest or if I tap it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.460 
from lowest to highest or if I tap it
again<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.549> go<00:03:44.670> highest<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.330> lowest

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
again it's going to go highest to lowest

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.220 
again it's going to go highest to lowest
so<00:03:46.470> we're<00:03:47.190> now<00:03:47.400> looking<00:03:47.640> at<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.330> best<00:03:48.959> value

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
so we're now looking at the best value

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.710 
so we're now looking at the best value
in<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.950> ten<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.280> fifteen<00:03:50.610> dollar<00:03:50.820> category<00:03:51.450> by

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720
