00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.149 
fairly close to the door you'll
eventually<00:01:09.060> teleport<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.200> car<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
eventually teleport into that car you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.859 
eventually teleport into that car you
know<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:11.400> cars<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.000> texturized<00:01:12.570> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
know these cars are a bit texturized in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.330 
know these cars are a bit texturized in
the<00:01:13.140> fact<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.439> because<00:01:13.650> they're<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the fact that because they're in the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.580 
the fact that because they're in the
discouraged<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.450> rocks<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:15.990> still<00:01:16.229> didn't

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
discouraged but rocks i still didn't

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
discouraged but rocks i still didn't
look<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.610> they've<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.880> effects

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
look like you know they've got effects

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
look like you know they've got effects
on<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.540> divided<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.320> texture<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
on them divided some texture to them so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
on them divided some texture to them so
the<00:01:20.250> car<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> should<00:01:20.790> look<00:01:20.850> more<00:01:21.180> different

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the car that should look more different

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.590 
the car that should look more different
than<00:01:21.869> any<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.159> car<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:23.970> cars<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.330> more

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
than any of a car so these cars are more

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
than any of a car so these cars are more

must<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.900> water<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
must be like water in one of the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.789 
must be like water in one of the
buildings<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.210> summer<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.600> that's<00:01:36.810> wise<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
buildings or summer and that's wise and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.190 
buildings or summer and that's wise and
it<00:01:38.340> happens<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.270> vice<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:40.049> see

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it happens I don't know vice can see

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
it happens I don't know vice can see
these<00:01:40.320> cars<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.310> shiny<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.909> when

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
these cars are just that shiny and when

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.120 
these cars are just that shiny and when
you<00:01:42.270> look<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> top<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> roof<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you look on the top of the roof and you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
you look on the top of the roof and you
actually<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> Sun<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.630> on

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
actually see like the Sun on them on

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.030 
actually see like the Sun on them on
some<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> vehicles<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:46.860> thinking

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
some of the vehicles now I'm thinking

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
some of the vehicles now I'm thinking
you<00:01:47.700> can't<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.689> no<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you can't see this one is no way this

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.920 
you can't see this one is no way this
storm<00:01:49.439> could<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.070> reflecting<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.420> these

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
storm could be reflecting on these

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
storm could be reflecting on these
vehicles<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.799> we're<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> garage<00:01:53.579> we're

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
vehicles because we're in a garage we're

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
vehicles because we're in a garage we're
in<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> car<00:01:54.299> park<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:55.229> one's<00:01:55.470> nowhere<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> be

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
in a car park this one's nowhere to be

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
in a car park this one's nowhere to be
seen<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.600> textures<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
seen so these are got textures on and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
seen so these are got textures on and
talk<00:01:58.439> reflective<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.280> realistic<00:01:59.579> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
talk reflective I'm not realistic and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359 
talk reflective I'm not realistic and
obviously<00:02:00.689> brooks<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.590> expect<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.159> be

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
obviously brooks i don't expect to be

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
obviously brooks i don't expect to be
able<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.729> into<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.990> some

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
able to get into here these have some

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.499 
able to get into here these have some
random<00:02:04.350> textures<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.070> them<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.270> start

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
random textures on them and I start

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.880 
random textures on them and I start
shooting<00:02:06.719> them<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.140> de<00:02:07.530> till<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.829> explode

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
shooting them now de till we explode

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.729 
shooting them now de till we explode
they<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:09.239> whatever<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.929> rain<00:02:10.410> water

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
they just do whatever because rain water

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.700 
they just do whatever because rain water
technically<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.700> opposite<00:02:12.030> explosion

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
technically so opposite explosion

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.710 
technically so opposite explosion
isn't<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> big<00:02:13.160> thing<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.610> just<00:02:13.700> rocks<00:02:14.480> and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
isn't a big thing it's just rocks and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.870 
isn't a big thing it's just rocks and
side<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.080> side<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.280> pretty<00:02:16.400> funny<00:02:16.670> and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
side to side but it's pretty funny and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.100 
side to side but it's pretty funny and
it's<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.120> something<00:02:17.450> random<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.990> can

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
it's just something random that you can

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.620 
it's just something random that you can
try<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.350> if<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> wanted<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.100> one<00:02:19.280> time<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.850> to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630
