the same problem we've discovered there

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
the same problem we've discovered there
are<00:01:14.850> three<00:01:15.299> different<00:01:15.750> versions<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.439> with

are three different versions one with

three batteries one with two batteries

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620 
three batteries one with two batteries

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
hidden secret so I'm surprised by this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.080 
hidden secret so I'm surprised by this
right<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.119> they<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.979> capacitor<00:01:25.979> here

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090

Ron<00:01:29.400> were<00:01:29.640> discovered<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.990> may<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.320> been<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
Ron were discovered what may have been a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
Ron were discovered what may have been a
quick<00:01:31.829> fix<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.369> fisher-price

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
quick fix by fisher-price

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.050 
quick fix by fisher-price
so<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> capacitor<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.400> capacitor

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
so that's the capacitor this capacitor

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.719 
so that's the capacitor this capacitor
which<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.509> store<00:01:36.720> excess<00:01:37.290> charge<00:01:37.710> appears<00:01:38.549> to
