00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
it they did get for this I think out of

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.770 
it they did get for this I think out of
the<00:01:34.310> items<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.880> we<00:01:35.090> got<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.420> deep<00:01:35.570> fried

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the items that we got the deep fried

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.719 
the items that we got the deep fried
place<00:01:36.020> next<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.590> or<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> little<00:01:36.950> smaller<00:01:37.220> this

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
place next to or a little smaller this

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.230 
place next to or a little smaller this
probably<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> best<00:01:38.450> value<00:01:38.960> but<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:40.190> don't<00:01:41.150> know

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
probably the best value but I don't know

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.609 
probably the best value but I don't know
you<00:01:41.660> want<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.869> take<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:41.990> bite<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.200> tell<00:01:42.530> them
