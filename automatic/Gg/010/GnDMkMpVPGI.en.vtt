weekend<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.840> thought<00:00:28.140> things<00:00:28.529> would

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
weekend is I thought things would

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.099 
weekend is I thought things would
actually<00:00:28.769> rise<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.550> price<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.720> turned<00:00:30.990> out

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
actually rise in price this turned out

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.479 
actually rise in price this turned out
for<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> most<00:00:31.500> part<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> case

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
for the most part to not be the case

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.030 
for the most part to not be the case
which<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> strange<00:00:33.510> right<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.500> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
which was kind of strange right now we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
which was kind of strange right now we
have<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> lowest<00:00:35.700> prices<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.360> RS

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
have some of the lowest prices in RS

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.330 
have some of the lowest prices in RS
that<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.140> had<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:38.040> long<00:00:38.309> time

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that we have had in a very long time

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
that we have had in a very long time
probably<00:00:38.850> since<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.320> release<00:00:40.649> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
probably since the very release of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.619 
probably since the very release of
evolution<00:00:41.340> comment<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:41.790> BOTS<00:00:42.030> were<00:00:42.270> still

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
evolution comment when BOTS were still

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.630 
evolution comment when BOTS were still
in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> game<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.829> haven't<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.399> seen

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
in the game and I haven't really seen

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
in the game and I haven't really seen
prices<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.360> stuff<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.899> low<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.649> are<00:00:46.680> now

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
prices of stuff as low as they are now

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
prices of stuff as low as they are now

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
since then especially all the drops that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
since then especially all the drops that
I<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.280> stuff<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.239> tormented<00:00:51.690> demons

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
I got from stuff like tormented demons

made<00:01:25.619> any<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:26.009> money<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.790> Slayer<00:01:27.180> has<00:01:27.330> gone

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
made any more money so Slayer has gone

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
made any more money so Slayer has gone
down<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.020> money<00:01:28.200> making<00:01:28.560> almost<00:01:28.979> half<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.549> much

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
down in money making almost half as much

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
down in money making almost half as much
as<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.970> used<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:31.079> top<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
as it used to be and on top of that that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649 
as it used to be and on top of that that
was<00:01:31.920> before<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> release<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.880> tormented

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
was before the release of tormented

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
was before the release of tormented
demon<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> glacé<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.890> TAS<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.820> you'd

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
demon and glacé or TAS as well so you'd

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
demon and glacé or TAS as well so you'd
kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.270> had<00:01:36.509> figured<00:01:36.900> maybe<00:01:37.320> Slayer<00:01:37.619> would

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
kind of had figured maybe Slayer would

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
kind of had figured maybe Slayer would
go<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> money<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.060> Slayer<00:01:39.420> has<00:01:39.600> become

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
go up and money but no Slayer has become

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.080 
go up and money but no Slayer has become
really<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.070> very<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.520> money<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
really not very good money and if you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.420 
really not very good money and if you
want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.479> money<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.189> place

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
want to make money this is not the place

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
want to make money this is not the place
to<00:01:44.460> look<00:01:44.790> although<00:01:45.060> BV<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> general<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to look although BV I mean in general is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
to look although BV I mean in general is
really<00:01:46.799> dropping<00:01:47.700> down<00:01:47.850> into<00:01:48.060> profit<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
really dropping down into profit that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
really dropping down into profit that
you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> make<00:01:48.899> per<00:01:49.049> hour<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.320> because

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you can make per hour just because

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
you can make per hour just because
there's<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.100> many<00:01:50.549> people<00:01:50.939> PV<00:01:51.240> aiming<00:01:51.509> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
there's so many people PV aiming and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.569 
there's so many people PV aiming and
really<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.229> quite<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.649> many<00:01:52.829> people<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
really not quite as many people that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
really not quite as many people that
need<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> supplies<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.720> PBA<00:01:55.079> members

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
need the supplies that the PBA members

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
need the supplies that the PBA members
are<00:01:55.470> getting<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.979> lot<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> time<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
are getting a lot of the time the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.850 
are getting a lot of the time the
biggest<00:01:57.540> problem<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.320> RS<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
biggest problem I think with RS is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
biggest problem I think with RS is
there's<00:01:59.040> too<00:01:59.219> many<00:01:59.310> people<00:01:59.520> who<00:01:59.790> are<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
there's too many people who are in the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
there's too many people who are in the
high<00:02:00.630> level<00:02:00.899> community<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> they<00:02:01.950> are

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
high level community and they are

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
high level community and they are
gathering<00:02:02.490> these<00:02:02.700> supplies<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.509> these<00:02:03.689> drops

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
gathering these supplies or these drops

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
gathering these supplies or these drops
and<00:02:04.380> these<00:02:04.530> pieces<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.100> armor<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> they

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and these pieces of armor that they

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.310 
and these pieces of armor that they
should<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.420> selling<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> low<00:02:06.840> level<00:02:07.110> players

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
should be selling to low level players

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.719 
should be selling to low level players
but<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.619> aren't<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.009> many<00:02:08.039> low<00:02:08.459> level

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
but there aren't as many low level

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.100 
but there aren't as many low level
players<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.179> actually<00:02:09.539> need<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> buy<00:02:10.050> this

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
stuff so what this ends up happening is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
stuff so what this ends up happening is
stuff

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
