00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.070
 we represent a building site today 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.260
 because it's not necessarily a 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.590
 technically complicated site by 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 against it is enough impacting to beat 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.970
 for transilien for the activity 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.349
 because as you can see, we have 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.730
 intercepted two lanes in the middle of the day 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.309
 so it's quite complicated vis-à-vis 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.350
 traffic and vis-à-vis customers 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.050
 to prospect is to exploit the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.059
 station so we set up rail that 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.379
 is harder but that will have a duration 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.370
 of life a little longer with a 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.129
 better reliability 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.809
 we put in place insulating joints 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.540
 a little bit thicker that go 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.950
 to have fewer incidents 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.950
 regularity - signaling incident 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.399
 this summer we take advantage of the period when he 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.379
 are a few less travelers with 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.239
 the agreement of elected officials to do work 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.950
 two days so we do a lot more 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.140
 work that usually we will change 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.970
 three kilometers of rails is the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.710
 the last three kilometers which are the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.270
 more used ones where there is braking 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.000
 and acceleration so the rail 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 ages quickly it represents 500 thousand 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.450
 euros of expenditure three weeks of 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.780
 work we will invest this year 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.729
 in 2014 two and a half billion for the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.479
 modernization and upgrading of 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.360
 amenities 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.830
 five years ago it was a billion so 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.570
 in five years we have multiplied by 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.880
 two and a half 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.460
 the effort dedicated to modernizing the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.439
 classical network and in consultation with 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.110
 elected representatives associations we made a 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.880
 all-round information from users 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 there is a bit my train there are buses from 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 replacement users include the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.430
 elected officials accept it but all this is for 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.100
 the good cause is that here at the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.920
 saint lazare station which has not benefited from 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.140
 modernization tgv and well the voices 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.909
 at the same level of quality and 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.619
 regularity than the other guys we 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.019
 ensure security in every priority 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.570
 this is our number one topic and it's 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.640
 for that the regularity had rather 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.120
 tendency to degrade over the years 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.280
 passed 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.269
 because as soon as there is the slightest 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.390
 problem 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.670
 we privilege security is the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.190
 best way to improve security 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.250
 and as to improve the regularity it is 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.860
 to modernize facilities that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.540
 aged the goal is regularity 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.540
 regularity regularity
