leaving the parking lot now motorcycles

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.119 
leaving the parking lot now motorcycles
are<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.420> lot<00:00:40.690> different<00:00:40.720> than<00:00:41.350> cars<00:00:41.739> and

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
are a lot different than cars and

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.270 
are a lot different than cars and
especially<00:00:43.030> bicycles<00:00:43.949> people<00:00:44.949> who<00:00:45.040> don't

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
especially bicycles people who don't

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.619 
especially bicycles people who don't
take<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.670> motorcycle<00:00:45.940> safety<00:00:46.420> foundation

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
take the motorcycle safety foundation

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.460 
take the motorcycle safety foundation
sometimes<00:00:47.620> will<00:00:48.190> find<00:00:48.430> themselves<00:00:49.470> steering

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
sometimes will find themselves steering

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.770 
sometimes will find themselves steering
like<00:00:50.650> a<00:00:50.680> bicycle<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.730> fact<00:00:52.089> it's<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.390> exact

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
like a bicycle in fact it's the exact

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.619 
like a bicycle in fact it's the exact
opposite<00:00:53.440> where<00:00:53.680> we<00:00:53.860> counter<00:00:54.280> steer<00:00:54.629> what

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
opposite where we counter steer what

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
opposite where we counter steer what
does<00:00:55.720> that<00:00:55.870> mean

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
does that mean

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
does that mean
basically<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.230> means<00:00:58.280> when<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
basically that means when you want to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
basically that means when you want to
turn<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:00.390> turn<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> handlebars

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
turn right you don't turn the handlebars

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
turn right you don't turn the handlebars
right<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.370> cause<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:02.969> go

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
right that will actually cause you to go

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.860 
right that will actually cause you to go
left<00:01:03.540> hence<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.500> word<00:01:04.670> countersteer

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
left hence the word countersteer

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.320 
left hence the word countersteer
John<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.280> turning<00:01:08.700> left<00:01:08.910> so<00:01:09.150> he's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
John right now is turning left so he's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.540 
John right now is turning left so he's
pushing<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.200> bit<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.620> right<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
pushing a little bit on the right and

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.230 
pushing a little bit on the right and
shifting<00:01:12.030> his<00:01:12.150> body<00:01:12.480> as<00:01:12.900> he<00:01:12.960> shifts<00:01:13.440> gears<00:01:14.240> now

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
shifting his body as he shifts gears now

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.970 
shifting his body as he shifts gears now
again<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:15.780> important<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> remember

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
again it's very important to remember

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.920 
again it's very important to remember
and<00:01:17.310> understand<00:01:17.790> countersteering<00:01:18.630> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and understand countersteering what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.540 
and understand countersteering what
countersteering<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.340> it's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
countersteering is going to do is it's

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.310 
countersteering is going to do is it's
going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.600> bike<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.050> direction

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
going to put the bike in the direction

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
going to put the bike in the direction
you<00:01:22.620> want<00:01:23.180> instead<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.240> turning<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you want instead of turning it like a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.750 
you want instead of turning it like a
handlebar<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.710> turn<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.340> actually

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
handlebar to turn right you actually

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.370 
handlebar to turn right you actually
going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> lean<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.300> little<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> left<00:01:28.140> bar

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
going to lean a little on the left bar

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.110 
going to lean a little on the left bar
as<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.800> put<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> body<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.610> slightly

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
as you put the body just slightly

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.210 
as you put the body just slightly
shifted<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:31.170> that's<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.160> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
shifted to the right that's going to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
shifted to the right that's going to
counter<00:01:32.610> steer<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.690> right<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
counter steer you to go to the right so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.930 
counter steer you to go to the right so
