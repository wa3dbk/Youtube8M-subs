it can get a little tricky here's some

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
it can get a little tricky here's some
things<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> keep<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.140> mind<00:01:10.200> first<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.799> all<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
things to keep in mind first of all the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
things to keep in mind first of all the
top<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> hard<00:01:12.720> part<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> hand<00:01:13.380> meaning

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
top is the hard part of the hand meaning

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
top is the hard part of the hand meaning
hardness<00:01:14.189> off<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.700> top<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.240> hard<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
hardness off the top is hard and that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
hardness off the top is hard and that
means<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> fingers<00:01:16.799> too<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.400> basically

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
means the fingers too so it's basically

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
means the fingers too so it's basically
a<00:01:18.409> one-line<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:20.630> little<00:01:21.630> thicker<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> end

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
a one-line a little thicker at the end

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.160 
a one-line a little thicker at the end
here<00:01:22.860> where<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> finger<00:01:23.340> tip<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.689> then

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
here where the finger tip is and then

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.679 
here where the finger tip is and then
here<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.970> bit<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> rounded

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
here we have a little bit of a rounded

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
here we have a little bit of a rounded
line<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> called<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.400> reverse<00:01:29.729> curve<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
line this is called a reverse curve I

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
line this is called a reverse curve I
don't<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.590> it's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
don't know if you can see that but it's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
don't know if you can see that but it's
curves<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> curves<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
curves this way and then it curves this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.399 
curves this way and then it curves this
way<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.920> subtle<00:01:35.400> look<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.960> does<00:01:37.229> make

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
way it's a subtle look but it does make

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.770 
way it's a subtle look but it does make
a<00:01:37.439> difference<00:01:37.560> otherwise<00:01:38.240> your<00:01:39.240> hand<00:01:39.479> looks<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a difference otherwise your hand looks a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
a difference otherwise your hand looks a
little<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.049> rigid<00:01:40.530> here's<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> top<00:01:41.970> knuckle

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
little bit rigid here's the top knuckle

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170 
little bit rigid here's the top knuckle
don't<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.700> goes<00:01:44.909> back<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
don't put that in here and goes back to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.560 
don't put that in here and goes back to
the<00:01:45.509> top<00:01:45.810> part<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> palm<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.360> back<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.010 
hand I mean and as we know that this is
all<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> top<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> hard<00:01:54.020> finished

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
all now all the top is hard finished

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
all now all the top is hard finished
right<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.590> near<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.159> base<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> thumb

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
right here near the base of the thumb

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.310 
right here near the base of the thumb
the<00:01:56.939> wrist<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> thinnest<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.930> comes<00:01:58.110> down

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the wrist is a thinnest it comes down

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.520 
the wrist is a thinnest it comes down
here<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> hard<00:01:58.740> angle<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> around<00:02:01.350> here

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
here to a hard angle and around here

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.709 
here to a hard angle and around here
this<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> first<00:02:02.210> joint<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.450> thumb

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
this is the first joint of the thumb

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.330 
this is the first joint of the thumb
people<00:02:04.200> don't<00:02:04.469> realize<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
people don't realize that this is a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.150 
people don't realize that this is a
joint<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> thumb<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:08.039> has

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
joint right here so a thumb actually has

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.609 
joint right here so a thumb actually has
three<00:02:08.849> joints<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
three joints in it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.370 
three joints in it
alright<00:02:10.619> now<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> top<00:02:12.120> knuckle

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
alright now if this is the top knuckle

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.050 
alright now if this is the top knuckle
that<00:02:13.560> means<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.830> fingers<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.520> attach<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that means the fingers have to attach to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.850 
that means the fingers have to attach to
it<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.750> instead<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.020> guessing<00:02:16.320> we

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
it so you know instead of guessing we

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.730 
it so you know instead of guessing we
know<00:02:17.040> now<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.610> goes<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:19.260> knuckle

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
know now it goes right to that knuckle

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.040 
know now it goes right to that knuckle
comes<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.250> comes<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:21.660> way<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.020> not

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
comes out comes out this way it's not

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.220 
comes out comes out this way it's not
straight<00:02:22.470> down<00:02:22.640> fingers<00:02:23.640> come<00:02:23.820> out<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.270> come

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
straight down fingers come out here come

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.270 
straight down fingers come out here come
back<00:02:25.440> here<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.950> they<00:02:26.400> curl<00:02:26.820> up<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.280> all

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
back here and they curl up like that all

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.570 
back here and they curl up like that all
right<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.700> let's<00:02:30.000> draw<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.540> thumb

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.350 

cradling<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.000> we're<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.120> going<00:02:36.330> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
cradling it so we're just going to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.410 
cradling it so we're just going to
overlap<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.320> how<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> overlaps<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:38.420> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
overlap you see how it overlaps it it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:52.070 
overlap you see how it overlaps it it
has<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.110> backward<00:02:40.560> Bend<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:51.690> so

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
has that kind of backward Bend like so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.120 
has that kind of backward Bend like so
and<00:02:53.480> we're<00:02:54.480> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.780> wrap<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.980> little

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and we're going to wrap that little

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.760 
and we're going to wrap that little
fleshy<00:02:56.640> part<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.020> wedge<00:02:58.230> right<00:02:58.500> here

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
fleshy part here in the wedge right here

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.270 
fleshy part here in the wedge right here
underneath<00:02:59.130> it<00:03:00.710> give<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.830> little<00:03:01.950> bit<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.220> a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
underneath it give it a little bit of a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.820 
underneath it give it a little bit of a
annotation<00:03:03.060> here<00:03:03.240> where<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.600> other<00:03:03.930> jaw

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
annotation here where the other jaw

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.500 
annotation here where the other jaw
would<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.480> right<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.370> palm<00:03:08.730> pad

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
would be right here is the palm pad

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.220 
would be right here is the palm pad
right<00:03:10.110> here<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.680> want<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> show<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:15.230> and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
right here so we want to show that and

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.070 
right here so we want to show that and
we're<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.680> bring<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.340> down<00:03:18.080> right

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
we're going to bring that down right

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.020 
we're going to bring that down right
here<00:03:19.290> into<00:03:19.710> that<00:03:19.890> wedge<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.510> thumb<00:03:23.030> bring

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
here into that wedge of the thumb bring

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.160 
here into that wedge of the thumb bring
this<00:03:24.150> down<00:03:24.390> here<00:03:24.810> bring<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.860> up<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:27.140> make<00:03:28.140> a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
this down here bring it up and make a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.580 
this down here bring it up and make a
little<00:03:28.380> crease<00:03:29.160> mark<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:30.480> so

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.800 

and<00:03:36.590> we'll<00:03:37.100> add<00:03:37.610> another<00:03:37.910> one<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:38.750> the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
and we'll add another one in the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.150 
and we'll add another one in the
background<00:03:39.020> just<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.410> show<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:39.710> depth

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
background just to show a little depth

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.920 
background just to show a little depth
to<00:03:40.370> show<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:40.670> not<00:03:40.880> just<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.270> not<00:03:41.390> just<00:03:41.510> one

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
to show this not just it's not just one

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.090 
to show this not just it's not just one
I'm<00:03:42.320> going<00:03:42.710> to<00:03:42.850> cut<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:43.940> off<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.240> little<00:03:44.450> more

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
I'm going to cut this off a little more

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.060 
I'm going to cut this off a little more
like<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:46.540> yeah<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.860> we're<00:03:48.980> going

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
like this yeah like that and we're going

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.710 
like this yeah like that and we're going
to<00:03:49.130> shade<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.430> little<00:03:49.790> underneath<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.360> just

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
to shade a little underneath this just

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.410 
to shade a little underneath this just
to<00:03:50.810> show<00:03:51.020> that<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.700> know<00:03:52.790> lights<00:03:53.120> coming

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
to show that it's you know lights coming

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.330 
to show that it's you know lights coming
down<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.780> way<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.320> helps<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.830> define<00:03:55.160> it

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
down this way and it helps to define it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.820 
down this way and it helps to define it
everything<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.180> same<00:03:56.210> tone<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:57.350> can<00:03:57.650> get<00:03:57.770> a

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
everything is the same tone it can get a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.190 
everything is the same tone it can get a
little<00:03:57.980> confusing<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.880> we<00:03:59.120> will<00:03:59.840> do<00:03:59.960> that

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
little confusing so we will do that

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.290 
little confusing so we will do that
we'll<00:04:00.560> add<00:04:00.740> a<00:04:00.770> little<00:04:01.100> bit<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.520> crease<00:04:02.270> here

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
we'll add a little bit of a crease here

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:15.370 
we'll add a little bit of a crease here
and<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:04.190> darken<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> bit

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.159 

and<00:04:16.380> bring<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.709> overlap<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> little<00:04:17.639> bit

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
and bring that overlap that a little bit

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.099 
and bring that overlap that a little bit
and<00:04:19.169> there<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.769> there<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.280> uh<00:04:21.109> it's

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
and there you have it there is a uh it's

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.820 
and there you have it there is a uh it's
a<00:04:22.200> hand<00:04:22.410> position<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:23.389> finger<00:04:24.389> point<00:04:24.830> all

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
a hand position that a finger point all
