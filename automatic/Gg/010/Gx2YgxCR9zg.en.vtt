medium jars in sun and sand and pink

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.770 
medium jars in sun and sand and pink
sands<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.800> it<00:03:40.640> was<00:03:40.760> actually<00:03:41.120> marked<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:41.630> it's

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
sands and it was actually marked so it's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.050 
sands and it was actually marked so it's
34<00:03:42.230> 99<00:03:42.440> originally<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.400> i<00:03:43.460> got<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.640> for<00:03:43.850> half

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
34 99 originally and i got it for half

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.450 
34 99 originally and i got it for half
off<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:45.050> i<00:03:45.620> think<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.490> was<00:03:46.550> like<00:03:46.900> 1750<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.280> got

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
off so i think it was like 1750 so I got

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.820 
off so i think it was like 1750 so I got
to<00:03:49.760> medium<00:03:50.210> jars<00:03:50.450> for<00:03:50.630> 1750<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.500> thought<00:03:51.710> that

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
to medium jars for 1750 I thought that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.190 
to medium jars for 1750 I thought that
was<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:51.980> great<00:03:52.130> deal<00:03:52.570> couldn't<00:03:53.570> pass<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.720> up<00:03:53.990> and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
was a great deal couldn't pass it up and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.600 
was a great deal couldn't pass it up and
actually<00:03:54.320> they're<00:03:54.590> kind<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.860> packaged<00:03:55.280> pretty

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
actually they're kind of packaged pretty

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.370 
actually they're kind of packaged pretty
well<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.330> I<00:03:56.390> think<00:03:56.450> I'll<00:03:56.660> just<00:03:56.690> stick<00:03:57.020> it<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.260> my

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.620 
well so I think I'll just stick it in my
suitcase<00:03:57.560> just<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.220> way<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.630> hopefully

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
suitcase just the way it is hopefully

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.560
