00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.069
 hello welcome to a yourself 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.340
 and I want to show you how 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.170
 you get this nice bottle from an old one 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.360
 can conjure up glossybox 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.790
 and I would say we start right away 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.550
 of course we need a great box 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.400
 and two matching empty packaging 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.960
 then we need cliff paper I have 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.019
 decided me much glitter foam rubber 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.680
 and then his colors gold and silver 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:35.590
 need enough of an ideal and a pair of scissors 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.630
 and a text and then we need it 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.000
 the writing to me was simply from the 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.239
 internet one printed ours 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.559
 Cook in the adhesive and always we 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.860
 can start 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.530
 I have all this empty now 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.180
 packaging still a tick like that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.160
 taped so I have no wolves 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.559
 so that everything has a nice shape 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.670
 and also grab of remains with 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.670
 just better to work 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.770
 then I ruler nor the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.990
 help 13 packages calculated 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.100
 and marked with a bottle nice 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.100
 Symmetrically, as a rule 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.380
 at commission with the pizza cartons 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.620
 children and that of silver on at 7 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.250
 The lid with the two small ones 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.380
 packagings 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.800
 I lie down to these banks because 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.330
 and of course the inverters you 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.410
 Can not do it with the ruler 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.940
 measure 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.610
 but I just did it 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.870
 because if somehow I'm too generous 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.200
 I can still cut one then 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.479
 Marked off a bit small here 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.660
 here then the middle because of the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.550
 then elongated part I need the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.150
 the only thing glued on it is the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.650
 side panels the more churches me too 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.100
 I then cut with all before 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.110
 can 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.080
 and then I need only one thing 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.750
 glue it on so that means I will 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.630
 then just the little dice with four 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.840
 side pieces then stick up and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.750
 below we do not need 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 I do the oblong part with three 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.160
 Please delete the lengths 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.590
 just like I said that's it 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.720
 even in the porsche there is no extra 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.940
 Adhesive tape but the new kita carton 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.430
 have taken just with the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.230
 Hot glue gun in solid gamestop 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.220
 firmly 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 then I have never had two here 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.320
 side parts which I have to glue on and 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.450
 the 14 elongated part 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.210
 Here I told you only the two 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.940
 sides because i'm the little team 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.010
 here on it glue 30 need left and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.030
 on the right , I am happy already 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.520
 measured 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.140
 I'm just fine here now 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.820
 and if I cut that right 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.390
 then I would have that others now 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.870
 just fit it and it does 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.120
 also 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.989
 and that's why I can share the two parts 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.370
 they're all stuck together 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.230
 impressive that is still stuck to that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.269
 nice holds together subject to the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.310
 Closure for our bottle of TV 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.709
 that means half of us already have 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.650
 I live the shutter long 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.019
 on glossybox on it because yes 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.790
 then be put together and see it 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.480
 already the form of meat and 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.310
 the back are already very great 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.010
 Bous if it has stuck well then 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.599
 Let's take the golden foil and 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.659
 have to mark the again here 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.030
 side pieces for the top stick that we 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.349
 before simply cut out and cut 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.349
 then stick on it 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.640
 to give practical life that self 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.560
 this impression even if I am myself 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.020
 somehow you can stick it fast 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.750
 pull down re- glue bit 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.510
 I find this loske totally practical 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.970
 I can not finish this and that now 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.040
 it still has this big rest piece 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.500
 I was the one I was on my big one 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.870
 glossybox on it glue I look that 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.060
 it in the middle and write it that way 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.760
 smooth as no effects penetrate 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 I have no wrinkles on my side 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.700
 you can see that even works 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.310
 So it's a little too small if that's it 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.989
 then it gets over the whole shape 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.520
 great of course I according to the then 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.070
 unfortunately not out 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.160
 then we need the lettering 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.710
 I just imagine that outside of the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.410
 Internet drunk then I think 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.100
 Simply center on the bottle again 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.310
 on it and we are done that is one 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.070
 great beautiful recycling classic 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.900
 Borges in a beautiful new 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.490
 garment 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.160
 you can always say 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.759
 stow and can store any things 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.930
 you put in a corner in beautiful 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.949
 The apartment and I think that makes 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.740
 some ago 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.570
 it is really nice out so I hope 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.050
 tutorial case and see you at 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.050
 next time
