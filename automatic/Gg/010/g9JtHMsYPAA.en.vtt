background i just paid and flush and now

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.549 
background i just paid and flush and now
it's<00:00:11.820> stopped<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.480> if<00:00:12.780> I'd<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.230> just<00:00:13.380> waited

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it's stopped so if I'd have just waited

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.200 
it's stopped so if I'd have just waited
a<00:00:13.740> few<00:00:13.920> more<00:00:14.099> seconds<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.730> wouldn't<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.059> had

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
a few more seconds I wouldn't have had

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.840

to<00:00:15.330> tell<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> about<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.949> figure<00:00:17.699> this

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
ratty this is so appropriate but the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
ratty this is so appropriate but the
point<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.920> trying<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> grow<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.370> bangs<00:01:02.730> out

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so these you see there's some there and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.359 
so these you see there's some there and
there's<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.900> piece<00:01:07.110> here

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
there's just like a little piece here

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
there's just like a little piece here
and<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.549> they're<00:01:08.700> getting<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.119> long<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and so they're getting pretty long but I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
and so they're getting pretty long but I
guess<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> maybe<00:01:11.430> have

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
guess what I'm going to do is maybe have

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
guess what I'm going to do is maybe have
that<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.150> hair<00:01:12.390> cut<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.530> top<00:01:13.830> layer<00:01:14.100> may<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that my hair cut the top layer may be a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399 
that my hair cut the top layer may be a
little<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:14.790> shorter<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> bangs<00:01:15.869> blend<00:01:16.259> in

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
little bit shorter so the bangs blend in

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.170 
little bit shorter so the bangs blend in
a<00:01:16.470> little<00:01:16.500> bit<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.070> we'll<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:18.060> I
