00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 hello how come we learn to set up a site to work on 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.819
 remotely and locally with contributing this is in case you're not 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.240
 we want to have some server forget the latent technology inside our 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.949
 site 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 I do not think we have to observe is that d the right side 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.599
 in the part that says 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.679
 English text but you can leave files 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.890
 d we see that we are working local form does not seem can not be the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.599
 exception 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.470
 what I'm going to do this is set up our site 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.210
 pump site 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 and again site 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.850
 in this way we are going to open a small menu that are very close 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.890
 God is going to go 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.800
 indicating 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.760
 how are we going we trust in our site 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.270
 it is a basic form 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.080
 allows an advanced protest 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 Well, we already know all the configurations that we have 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 but as it is a form and we already did it in the most 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.299
 I think he asks us what is the name our site our site 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.780
 as our project 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.900
 then it gets as bad of him 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.460
 where our site is hosted it was noticed we already have a cyclops 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.310
 created 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.610
 in the internet server goal 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.290
 expose here the address but in this case our desire not to do helmets 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.440
 he does not feel that he asks us 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.090
 if we are working with some technology that works on the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.910
 Serbian 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.550
 we are going to work on these tutorials with 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.370
 php and with messi like him 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.920
 we say that we do have a technology and we choose which 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.880
 the bottom part comes php file and sql 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 we take them let's say nec 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.860
 and here he asks us 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 where they are going we are going to file the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 documents locally 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.830
 we will work on two sides one on the server and even more on 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.980
 our computer 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 our computer 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.010
 what loughner 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.650
 they have those files 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.420
 in this case the documents are in the folder that is called 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.110
 malovic 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.710
 what we are going to do is see the normal path of my files I do not know 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.920
 i save and we give you month 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 of the way it will ask us where our server is and in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 what part of our server is this part yes it is very 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.029
 important 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.159
 I believe that yes we are in a local server 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.169
 but where are those local files within our own 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:23.979
 machine 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.149
 I'm using a technology called sanz 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.859
 then I know what that file is be installed 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.389
 on the disk c 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.189
 henson 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.699
 this is a configuration 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.699
 basic of an apache server 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.099
 then we go ht box which is where the files that are normally saved 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.149
 they are going to unfold 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.709
 i choose the folder that she believes 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.669
 but if it is not there you can do it 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.079
 and it's called malovic 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.059
 and there are read save 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.040
 thus 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.030
 the files that are in local form are going to be transferred from the server 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.890
 which in this case is in that location for being our own 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.319
 computer 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.579
 does not face it good and where 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.969
 will access the browser to those files 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.119
 in this case it is crazy of jost effectively but the same folder that 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.039
 we just created week what there is 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.329
 then we put the name and make a text 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.109
 vrs 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.249
 we see that 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.219
 the test is satisfactory 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.889
 let's accept 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.629
 we have been months 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.379
 and he asks us if we want 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.869
 work with this one 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.770
 collaborators and with other types of people 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.650
 in this case 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.039
 we go from the local self-employed hector we leave as not 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:43.649
 and in this way did not show a small definition of our site we were 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.269
 Tintin and his gift 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.259
 west to finish 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.839
 now yes from our right side we return 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.839
 and we see what appears in the files remotely 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.749
 and the form files 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.639
 if we extend this part a bit 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.659
 let's see the addresses where each of these files are located 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:08.949
 if they realize 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.189
 the local form 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.189
 He shows me a folder of my bad documents from him 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.049
 if we change to remote mode 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.229
 shows 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.290
 c 2 points santa removera optimal obelisk of the same goat of test that 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.550
 I have believe 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.919
 that would be the basic configuration to start working 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.499
 a remote site 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:31.699
