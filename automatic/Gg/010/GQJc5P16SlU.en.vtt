anticipated was going to come together
as<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.880> feel<00:00:27.210> sprint<00:00:27.539> today<00:00:28.580> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.699> every

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
as I feel sprint today you know every

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
as I feel sprint today you know every
day<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> beginning<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.260> seems<00:00:31.679> like

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
day in the beginning it seems like

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.130 
day in the beginning it seems like
whenever<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> flag<00:00:32.520> goes<00:00:32.759> down<00:00:32.930> right<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
whenever the flag goes down right in

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.119 
whenever the flag goes down right in
kilometres<00:00:34.710> zero<00:00:35.160> there's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.670> breakaway<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
kilometres zero there's a breakaway and

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.490 
kilometres zero there's a breakaway and
yeah<00:00:38.129> yet<00:00:38.460> again<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.450> yeah<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> think

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
yeah yet again but yeah I think

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
yeah yet again but yeah I think
everybody<00:00:41.010> picked<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> stages<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
everybody picked the stages to be a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
everybody picked the stages to be a
field<00:00:42.899> sprint<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.829> back<00:00:44.010> to

obviously<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.759> did<00:01:30.090> notice<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> ore<00:01:30.600> cart

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
obviously i did notice the ore cart

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.319 
obviously i did notice the ore cart
there<00:01:31.710> were<00:01:31.770> cars<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.150> see

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
there were cars there and you can see

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
there were cars there and you can see
the<00:01:33.450> writers<00:01:33.689> swerving<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> avoid<00:01:34.650> them<00:01:35.130> but

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the writers swerving to avoid them but

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
the writers swerving to avoid them but
you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.479> part<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> race<00:01:37.049> ice<00:01:37.320> all

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you know it's part of the race ice all

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
you know it's part of the race ice all
right<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> leaning<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.250> each<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.759> well

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
right is leaning on each other as well

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.569 
right is leaning on each other as well
and<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> wasn't<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and that wasn't because of the of the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
and that wasn't because of the of the
cars<00:01:41.820> at<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.540> no<00:01:42.630> cars<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
cars at all there are no cars at that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.870 
cars at all there are no cars at that
stage<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:43.950> i<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> classes

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
stage and so i think one of the classes

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.210 
stage and so i think one of the classes
may<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.540> been<00:01:45.659> caused<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:47.100> know

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
may have been caused because of you know

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
may have been caused because of you know
they're<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.490> doing<00:01:47.700> cars<00:01:48.420> parked<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
they're all doing cars parked on the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539

well this cluster look it's part of it
it's<00:01:56.610> part<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.119> he<00:01:57.210> can't<00:01:57.450> just

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
it's part of it like he can't just

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's part of it like he can't just
automatically<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.219> aren't<00:01:59.340> going

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460

so<00:04:52.470> it's<00:04:52.620> still<00:04:52.830> open<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:54.720> know<00:04:54.870> we're

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
so it's still open and you know we're

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.320 
so it's still open and you know we're
expecting<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.470> big<00:04:55.620> crowd<00:04:55.650> out<00:04:55.920> there<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.580> I

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
expecting a big crowd out there and I

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.970 
expecting a big crowd out there and I
think<00:04:57.510> last<00:04:57.690> year<00:04:57.930> we<00:04:58.020> had<00:04:58.200> broke<00:04:58.530> records

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
think last year we had broke records

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.860 
think last year we had broke records
along<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.910> hill<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.330> think<00:05:00.540> tomorrow<00:05:00.810> is

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
along the hill and I think tomorrow is

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.510 
along the hill and I think tomorrow is
going<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.050> be<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.230> same<00:05:01.410> can<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.070> pinpoint<00:05:02.250> a
