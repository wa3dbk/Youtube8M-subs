to jack stands let's go down here and
take<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> look<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:23.130> how<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.609> part<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.630> been

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
take a look and how this part has been

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.980 
take a look and how this part has been
supported<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.420> there<00:00:27.600> that<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
supported so we can see there that the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
supported so we can see there that the
rubber<00:00:28.199> pads<00:00:28.500> contacting<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> front<00:00:29.519> Jack

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
rubber pads contacting the front Jack

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.269 
rubber pads contacting the front Jack
point<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.349> once<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.010> a<00:00:32.040> car

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
point and once we actually have a car

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.020 
point and once we actually have a car
raised<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.940> supported<00:00:33.720> by<00:00:34.110> those<00:00:35.030> jack

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
raised and supported by those jack

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.910 
raised and supported by those jack
stands<00:00:36.269> then<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.620> able<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> actually

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
stands then I will be able to actually

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
stands then I will be able to actually

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.460 
same same procedure and we have the jack
set<00:03:15.280> at<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> same<00:03:15.670> same<00:03:16.660> height<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.080> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
set at the same same height and the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.670 
set at the same same height and the
garage<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.890> level<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.230> when<00:03:20.230> we'd<00:03:20.380> service

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
garage is level so when we'd service

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.860 
garage is level so when we'd service
differential<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.700> few<00:03:21.850> minutes<00:03:22.120> we'll<00:03:22.720> be

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
differential in a few minutes we'll be

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.650 
differential in a few minutes we'll be
able<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.080> fill<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.440> drain<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.680> properly

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.570 

authorized<00:03:31.660> location<00:03:32.290> I'm<00:03:33.250> gonna<00:03:33.400> go<00:03:33.519> ahead

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
authorized location I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.070 
authorized location I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:33.670> point<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.610> raised<00:03:36.989> with<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
and point it out so we raised with the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.830 
and point it out so we raised with the
floor<00:03:38.260> jack<00:03:38.470> right<00:03:38.709> here<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.750> where

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
floor jack right here and this is where

00:03:40.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
floor jack right here and this is where
we<00:03:40.959> lifted<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.230> differential

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.720 

okay<00:04:33.860> guys<00:04:34.720> yeah
