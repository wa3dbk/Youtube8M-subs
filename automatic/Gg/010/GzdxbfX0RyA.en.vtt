00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

had<00:01:23.130> training<00:01:23.609> Trek<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.929> slow<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
had training Trek it's really slow and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.149 
had training Trek it's really slow and
some<00:01:26.130> part<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> drag<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.710> faster

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
some part of the drag you can go faster

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.550 
some part of the drag you can go faster
and<00:01:29.399> if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.819> go<00:01:30.000> left<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.719> right<00:01:30.780> side<00:01:31.229> it's
