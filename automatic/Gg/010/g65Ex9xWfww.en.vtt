which is so weird cuz I saw it right
there<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> wait<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
there and all just like wait what the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.850 
there and all just like wait what the
 Super<00:00:42.059> Saiyan<00:00:42.300> God<00:00:42.540> Super<00:00:42.600> saying<00:00:43.260> that

 Super Saiyan God Super saying that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
 Super Saiyan God Super saying that
makes<00:00:44.219> no<00:00:44.760> sense<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.750> pretty<00:00:45.899> sure<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
makes no sense but I'm pretty sure you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.569 
makes no sense but I'm pretty sure you
know<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.379> Japanese<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.890> probably<00:00:47.309> makes<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
know in Japanese and probably makes a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.709 
know in Japanese and probably makes a
little<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.000> sense<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
little bit more sense but this is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
little bit more sense but this is
translated<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.469> English<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.340> why<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> cut

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
translated into English that's why I cut

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.189 
translated into English that's why I cut
it<00:00:51.030> kind<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> sounds<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.750> weird<00:00:51.989> but

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
it kind of sounds a little bit weird but

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.389 
it kind of sounds a little bit weird but
like<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.710> said<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> guys<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.309> to
