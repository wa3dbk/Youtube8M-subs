00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
paths for example the glasses just to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
paths for example the glasses just to
create<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.690> circle<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.739> slide<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.309> had

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
create this circle and the slide I had

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
create this circle and the slide I had
to<00:01:02.609> use<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:03.030> paths<00:01:03.769> now<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.400> join

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
to use two paths now if I want to join

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.109 
to use two paths now if I want to join
them<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> couple<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.320> options<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.970> go

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
them I have a couple of options I can go

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
them I have a couple of options I can go
into<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.450> pathfinders<00:01:10.260> palette<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> select

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
into my pathfinders palette and select

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
into my pathfinders palette and select
them<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.479> group<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:15.150> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
them I could group them but then it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.289 
them I could group them but then it's
only<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:16.290> paths<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
only going to be two paths what if I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
only going to be two paths what if I
want<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> fill<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> have

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
group these I did not go to my

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.080 
group these I did not go to my
pathfinders<00:02:07.229> palette<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.799> didn't<00:02:08.190> hit<00:02:08.580> command

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
pathfinders palette I didn't hit command

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.979 
pathfinders palette I didn't hit command
G<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> group<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:10.190> it's<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.489> automatic

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.860 

now<00:02:15.989> another<00:02:16.409> great<00:02:16.650> thing<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.819> not<00:02:18.659> only

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
now another great thing is that not only

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.470 
now another great thing is that not only
is<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> grouped<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.489> it's<00:02:20.640> not<00:02:20.819> two<00:02:21.150> paths

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
is a grouped but it's not two paths

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
is a grouped but it's not two paths
either<00:02:22.579> it's<00:02:23.579> one<00:02:24.030> object<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.799> easily

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
either it's one object you can easily

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.470 
either it's one object you can easily
fill<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:28.110> something<00:02:28.620> like<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> gradient

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.479 

unlike<00:02:34.069> these<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:40.290> works<00:02:40.590> even<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.220> want

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
unlike these this works even if I want

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.030 
unlike these this works even if I want
to<00:02:41.609> go<00:02:41.970> back<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.049> start<00:02:43.290> drawing<00:02:43.560> into

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to go back to it and start drawing into

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.099 
to go back to it and start drawing into
it<00:02:44.480> as<00:02:46.280> long<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.489> it's<00:02:47.639> the<00:02:47.700> same<00:02:47.790> color<00:02:48.359> it's

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
it as long as it's the same color it's

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.899 
it as long as it's the same color it's
going<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.470> say<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.769> same<00:02:51.440> just<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.909> all

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
going to say the same just like that all

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.470 
going to say the same just like that all
one<00:02:54.769> even<00:02:55.769> if<00:02:55.889> I<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.159> deselected<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.150> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
one even if I have a deselected if I

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.300 
one even if I have a deselected if I
keep<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> same<00:02:58.019> color<00:02:59.480> 01<00:03:03.889> now<00:03:04.889> you're

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
keep the same color 01 now you're

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.429 
keep the same color 01 now you're
probably<00:03:05.549> wondering<00:03:05.819> well<00:03:06.629> what<00:03:07.109> if<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.379> don't

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
probably wondering well what if I don't

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.229 
probably wondering well what if I don't
want<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:07.889> to<00:03:07.950> group<00:03:08.220> together<00:03:09.889> if<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:11.760> have<00:03:12.000> this

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
want it to group together if I have this

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.379 
want it to group together if I have this
little<00:03:12.299> thing<00:03:12.750> right<00:03:12.780> here<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:14.790> want<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
little thing right here and I want to

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.390 
little thing right here and I want to
put<00:03:15.569> something<00:03:15.810> across<00:03:16.170> here<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.340> don't

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
put something across here but I don't

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.479 
put something across here but I don't
want<00:03:17.699> it<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.819> group<00:03:18.180> with<00:03:18.389> this<00:03:18.569> squiggly<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
want it to group with this squiggly I

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.039 
want it to group with this squiggly I
can<00:03:20.489> just<00:03:20.669> change<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.419> color<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:24.049> then

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
can just change the color of it and then

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.409 
can just change the color of it and then
it<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:25.650> affect<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.489> will<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.879> two

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
it will not affect it it will be two

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.289 
it will not affect it it will be two
different<00:03:27.540> paths<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.639> could<00:03:29.639> still<00:03:30.150> move

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
different paths I could still move

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:39.289 
different paths I could still move
around<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.900> adjust<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:34.159> now<00:03:35.720> what<00:03:36.720> if<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:38.299> want

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
around and adjust it now what if I want

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
around and adjust it now what if I want
to<00:03:39.480> group<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.049> together<00:03:40.169> but<00:03:41.069> i<00:03:41.099> forgot<00:03:41.459> to

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
to group it together but i forgot to

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.920 
to group it together but i forgot to
group<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.150> when<00:03:42.359> i<00:03:42.389> was<00:03:42.629> originally<00:03:43.290> using<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
group it when i was originally using it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.559 
group it when i was originally using it
well<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.319> take<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.739> take<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> same<00:03:47.519> color<00:03:47.790> and

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
well just take it take a same color and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.849 
well just take it take a same color and
go<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.379> all<00:03:49.560> done<00:03:51.049> but<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.379> may<00:03:52.799> be

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
go like that it's all done but it may be

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.699 
go like that it's all done but it may be
a<00:03:53.040> problem<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.909> we<00:03:54.479> have<00:03:54.629> another<00:03:54.930> object<00:03:55.260> out

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
a problem if we have another object out

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.330 
a problem if we have another object out
here<00:03:56.209> if<00:03:57.209> we<00:03:57.269> have<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.599> object<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.500> we<00:03:59.129> want

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
here if we have that object and we want

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.119 
here if we have that object and we want
to<00:03:59.430> group<00:04:00.299> something<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:00.989> we<00:04:01.949> could

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
to group something to this we could

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.520 
to group something to this we could
easily<00:04:02.639> go<00:04:02.819> into<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.239> by<00:04:03.419> accident<00:04:03.449> and<00:04:04.109> it'll

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
easily go into it by accident and it'll

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.640 
easily go into it by accident and it'll
joint<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:06.569> if<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.930> don't<00:04:07.049> want<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.470> to

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
joint so if you don't want that to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.559 
joint so if you don't want that to
happen<00:04:07.680> instead<00:04:08.639> of<00:04:08.790> moving<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.239> out<00:04:09.419> of<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
happen instead of moving this out of the

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.349 
happen instead of moving this out of the
way<00:04:09.629> all<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.919> have<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.190> do<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.609> double<00:04:12.329> click

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
way all you have to do is double click

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.170 
way all you have to do is double click
on<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.750> tool<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.199> check<00:04:14.159> off<00:04:14.370> selection

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
on the tool and check off selection

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.680 
on the tool and check off selection
limits<00:04:15.690> merge<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:17.609> basically<00:04:17.909> gives<00:04:18.419> us

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
limits merge and that basically gives us

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.790 
limits merge and that basically gives us
more<00:04:18.989> control<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.709> where<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> merges<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:22.440> ok<00:04:22.740> to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
more control on where it merges it ok to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.790 
more control on where it merges it ok to
accept<00:04:23.039> it<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.779> it<00:04:24.779> will<00:04:25.020> only

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
accept it and it will only

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.589 
accept it and it will only
charged<00:04:25.949> with<00:04:26.280> what<00:04:26.789> you<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.479> selected<00:04:29.599> I'll

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
charged with what you have selected I'll

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.020 
charged with what you have selected I'll
go<00:04:30.810> right<00:04:31.050> through<00:04:31.259> both<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.650> them<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.030> it's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
go right through both of them and it's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.390 
go right through both of them and it's
only<00:04:33.270> affected<00:04:33.930> than<00:04:34.080> what<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.259> had<00:04:34.470> selected

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.430 

we<00:04:38.400> could<00:04:38.580> easily<00:04:39.090> use<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.599> blob<00:04:39.810> brush<00:04:40.050> tool

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
we could easily use the blob brush tool

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.619 
we could easily use the blob brush tool
with<00:04:41.039> other<00:04:41.310> tools<00:04:41.639> such<00:04:41.909> as<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.090> eraser<00:04:42.599> tool

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
with other tools such as the eraser tool

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.689 
with other tools such as the eraser tool
and<00:04:43.699> erase<00:04:44.699> what<00:04:44.940> we<00:04:45.030> don't<00:04:45.180> want<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:46.460> then<00:04:47.460> if

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
and erase what we don't want and then if

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.450 
and erase what we don't want and then if
you<00:04:47.909> get<00:04:48.090> any<00:04:48.300> hard<00:04:48.900> edges<00:04:49.110> just<00:04:50.000> use<00:04:51.000> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
you get any hard edges just use the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.119 
you get any hard edges just use the
smooth<00:04:53.460> tool<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:54.330> finish<00:04:54.629> up<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.840> job<00:04:56.419> and

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
smooth tool to finish up the job and

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.219 
smooth tool to finish up the job and
that's<00:04:59.129> basically<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.699> that's<00:05:00.539> how<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:00.870> can

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
that's basically it that's how you can

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.420 
that's basically it that's how you can
easily<00:05:02.039> use<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:03.120> pink<00:05:03.569> blob<00:05:03.960> tool<00:05:04.349> for<00:05:04.979> easier

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
easily use the pink blob tool for easier

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.809 
easily use the pink blob tool for easier
productivity<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.389> Adobe<00:05:07.169> Illustrator<00:05:07.319> I<00:05:08.099> hope

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
productivity in Adobe Illustrator I hope

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.940
