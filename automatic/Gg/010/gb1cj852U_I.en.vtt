00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.390
 hello beautiful people welcome to be 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.820
 this channel today I bring you the 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.970
 review of the makeup base l'oréal 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.270
 its more 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.070
 if you are interested, please subscribe if 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.600
 eat and before I start I want to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.619
 mention that this makeup is 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.140
 recorded whether it is before or after 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.880
 but when it is ready it will be down 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.730
 in the third information or here as 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.780
 objective videos let's start with the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.790
 review let's start with the coverage and of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 this foundation makeup good then in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.650
 No side says it's from some 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 specific coverage in particular but 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.620
 I consider that it is of medium coverage and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.350
 It can be 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.040
 half full medium that is to say it is moldable 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.620
 with this I mean you can 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.110
 apply layers on layer and if you get to 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.829
 full or complete coverage but not 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.989
 maximum and the application very easy with 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.330
 brush with sponge with the brush that 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.420
 you want and if you crave it in your fingers 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.770
 It is just one of the makeup bags 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.200
 that I have used that are 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.969
 very very easy to use with 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.420
 any tool you have at home 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.920
 even those of durability in no 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.979
 side of the container tells us that it should 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.250
 last some time so I would say that 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.799
 lasts six to seven hours by applying 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.020
 a very good prebase before so 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.450
 I consider it a reasonable time and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.870
 pretty decent for a base of 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.300
 makeup 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.570
 The texture of this foundation is 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.930
 liquid there you can see it liquid but 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.870
 as water is not excessively liquid it is 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.940
 a medium term but if you feel very 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.610
 light in the texture of the base of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.180
 Makeup price you know I leave it 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.920
 somewhere on the screen I leave it on 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.320
 Mexican pesos and I also leave it in 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.230
 dollars this presentation and I found it 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.610
 in samborns but I do not remember the price 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.410
 so I'm going to put it here 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.420
 I did the already know that all this 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.540
 investigated and I put it on the screen the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.630
 all the whole question of price in the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.700
 photos I think I can say no 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.460
 it is adequate because in fact 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.590
 it's practically not noticeable if you take 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.800
 photos with flash I can not see myself 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.410
 white especially if you use your tone to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.050
 photos I think the range of 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.900
 colors is the basis of makeup 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.320
 that I think more colors have because 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.760
 really, it has from the most 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.400
 clarito 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.020
 coming from shades coming from sub tones 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.960
 yellow roses 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.580
 now the range of 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.620
 colors that this base has 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.390
 makeup this makes it super positive 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.090
 for the base because you're sure to 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.430
 find your tourist tone my color 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.000
 exact in this makeup base is they are 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.150
 beige w 6 if I have left tantito already what 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.970
 I combine a little bit with the w7 but this one 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.580
 I think it's my exact tone and what happens to me 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.770
 something really weird with this base that I do not 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.130
 I tell him to have his yellow tone and still 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.950
 so I do not feel like I look pink and that 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.630
 I like the container is glass and it brings 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.550
 a lid like that and there's a hole there 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.560
 this is one of the negative points of 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.940
 the makeup base that is 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.110
 presentation does not contain dispenser 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.840
 Any comment that has arrived 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.700
 presentation the new presentation I think 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.400
 that does bring the dispenser but good 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.620
 this does not bring it this base contains 30 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.500
 milliliters like most of the bases 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.020
 the sun protection factor is 17 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.320
 so good then 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.590
 it's not very high point or positive but 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.630
 it can also be negative does not depend 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.740
 as you see it later so if it's true it's 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.500
 that although it has the protection factor 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.830
 solar I do not feel that it's from those bases of 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.930
 makeup that you reflect the light of 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.420
 flash in the face or that you see more 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.740
 clear that the body does not think so 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.960
 but I think it must be because the 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.630
 Sun protection factor is not so 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.040
 tall has a slight odor based on 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.810
 makeup nothing nothing penetrating nothing that 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.720
 you feel that it will affect you 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.730
 If you are special with odors the amount 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.620
 the application practically disappears 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.780
 then then this is not a point that is 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 negative for the bottom in conclusion what 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.370
 qualification I put to the base of 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.290
 makeup of l'oréal true match I'll go 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.450
 to put 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.360
 9.5 and as not because he has sought me the most 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.490
 leaves the skin as the average cover you 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.620
 leaves the heavy and heavy face of 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.540
 makeup does not leave you for nothing 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.100
 like the durability and nowhere 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.470
 of the container makes us how much we have to 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.080
 last then the company is not there 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.970
 lying in no time the price I 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.110
 it seems decent from my point of view 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.900
 of the makeup bases of 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.170
 best quality supermarket that exists 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.830
 point 5 that I take away is only 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.620
 for the roll of the container and not to bring 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.169
 Ossified from the outside is one of my 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.930
 makeup bases but super favorites 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.320
 if they have the opportunity to try it 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.790
 I recommend them and for day to day is 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.760
 excellent little says it's for some 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:25.020
 especially skin type very universal 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.540
 that practically if you have the kind of 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:32.370
 you have, you can use the 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.560
 I have mixed the dry skin until I could 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.230
 ensure that thank you 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.730
 I do not get the brightness fast I had 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.130
 I really want to do this review because 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.790
 I wanted to share with you my 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.740
 thinking about these if you 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.919
 they ask me recommend me at the base 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.190
 for daily that is economic that 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.800
 have good coverage that lasts 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.420
 I recommend you, I love it, it's one of 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.880
 the foundations of makeup that I most 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.310
 they like this would be all in this review 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.140
 I hope you liked it, I continue like this 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.550
 I ask you to give me a little finger up 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.950
 they know that you help me a lot 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.780
 with this question 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.880
 I send you a giant kiss, take care 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.070

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.610
 the make-up base Redland Berlin is 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:26.640
 the company
