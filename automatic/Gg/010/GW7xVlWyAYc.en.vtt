regimen<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.559> could<00:00:14.280> ask<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.639> question<00:00:15.059> so

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
regimen I could ask this question so

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.750 
regimen I could ask this question so
much<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.590> took<00:00:16.800> me<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> long<00:00:17.160> time<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.460> make

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
much and it took me a long time to make

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
much and it took me a long time to make
the<00:00:17.850> video<00:00:18.090> because<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> thought<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.320> myself<00:00:19.500> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the video because I thought to myself I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.340 
the video because I thought to myself I
really<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.670> don't<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> regimen<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
really just don't have a regimen but I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.490 
really just don't have a regimen but I
guess<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:23.400> thinking<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:25.289> this

guess I'm thinking of you know do this

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.529 
guess I'm thinking of you know do this
this<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.369> day<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.480> day

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this on this day and then on that day

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.599 
this on this day and then on that day
but<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> started<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
but then I started to think about it and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
but then I started to think about it and
I<00:00:29.849> mean<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> same<00:00:30.960> products<00:00:31.500> I've

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it my theory is if it ain't broke don't

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.560 
it my theory is if it ain't broke don't
fix<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.500> never<00:01:49.770> had<00:01:50.460> any<00:01:51.119> problems

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
let's get into the product I used
probably<00:02:22.200> maybe<00:02:22.650> two<00:02:22.769> different<00:02:23.190> face<00:02:23.910> washes

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
probably maybe two different face washes

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.220 
probably maybe two different face washes
and<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.190> morning<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.970> used<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.690> clean<00:02:28.019> and

through<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.630> powder<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.319> end<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.650> shining

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
through the powder and I end up shining

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.400 
through the powder and I end up shining

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
two times a day because it does have a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.259

because it does not have the exfoliating
properties<00:04:56.729> which<00:04:57.510> is<00:04:57.750> why<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:57.990> use<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.680> so
