that's<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.539> other<00:04:27.720> law<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.500> guess<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.490> costly

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
that's the other law I guess and costly

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.420 
that's the other law I guess and costly
like<00:04:30.690> positions<00:04:31.349> of<00:04:31.500> these<00:04:31.620> two<00:04:31.889> bear<00:04:32.099> than

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
like positions of these two bear than

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.749 
like positions of these two bear than
the<00:04:32.610> AV<00:04:33.300> one<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:35.400> they<00:04:35.490> have<00:04:35.520> more

the<00:04:51.800> way<00:04:51.920> they<00:04:52.040> didn't<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.370> muscles<00:04:52.730> felt

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
the way they didn't the muscles felt

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.010 
the way they didn't the muscles felt
because<00:04:53.060> they're<00:04:53.300> just<00:04:53.390> kids<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:53.900> they

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
because they're just kids so they

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.960 
because they're just kids so they
shouldn't<00:04:54.230> be<00:04:54.350> like<00:04:54.650> really<00:04:55.460> buff<00:04:55.760> or
