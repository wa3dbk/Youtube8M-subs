00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.350 

I<00:03:21.290> think<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.410> biggest<00:03:22.650> allure<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.520> Montana<00:03:24.030> is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
I think the biggest allure to Montana is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.350 
I think the biggest allure to Montana is
the<00:03:24.810> fact<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.320> there<00:03:25.560> are<00:03:25.710> these<00:03:25.890> vast

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
the fact that there are these vast

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.630 
the fact that there are these vast
landscapes<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.570> explore<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:29.010> are<00:03:29.190> just<00:03:29.460> as

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
landscapes to explore that are just as

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.880 
landscapes to explore that are just as
beautiful<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:30.420> any<00:03:30.840> mountain<00:03:31.320> landscape

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
beautiful as any mountain landscape

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.730 
beautiful as any mountain landscape
anywhere<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.460> earth<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:34.290> you're<00:03:34.620> going

anywhere on earth and all you're going

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.200 
anywhere on earth and all you're going
to<00:03:34.830> see<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.190> wild<00:03:35.790> critters<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.450> no<00:03:37.380> people

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
to see is wild critters and no people

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.460 
to see is wild critters and no people
there<00:03:39.210> aren't<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.390> lot<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.570> places<00:03:39.720> left<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.380> the
