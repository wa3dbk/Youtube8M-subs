00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
from 86 to a 91 or even 92 if you use

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.740 
from 86 to a 91 or even 92 if you use
the<00:03:11.290> loan-out<00:03:12.160> glitch<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.060> tried<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.570> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the loan-out glitch but I tried it it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.280 
the loan-out glitch but I tried it it
didn't<00:03:14.080> work<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.560> actually<00:03:15.360> bumped<00:03:16.360> down<00:03:16.510> his

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
didn't work it actually bumped down his

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.710 
didn't work it actually bumped down his
potential<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.610> was<00:03:18.760> really<00:03:19.060> weird

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
potential and that was really weird

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.060 
potential and that was really weird
I<00:03:19.840> don't<00:03:19.989> know<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.290> never<00:03:20.500> happened<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.040> me

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
will be updated in the next fifa and he

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.270 
will be updated in the next fifa and he
has<00:03:32.739> low<00:03:33.010> stamina<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.870> mean<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:36.130> low
