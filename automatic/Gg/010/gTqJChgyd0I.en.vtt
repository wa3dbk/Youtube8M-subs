00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
hey there You tubes so I'm going to cut

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.030 
hey there You tubes so I'm going to cut
right<00:00:05.729> to<00:00:05.939> the<00:00:06.089> chase<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.629> wanted<00:00:07.439> to<00:00:07.560> make<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.740> 3

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
right to the chase I wanted to make a 3

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.360 
right to the chase I wanted to make a 3
by<00:00:08.220> 3<00:00:08.509> door<00:00:09.509> that<00:00:10.019> was<00:00:10.200> activated<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.160> went

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
by 3 door that was activated that went

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.900 
by 3 door that was activated that went
straight<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.030> down<00:00:12.059> out<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.629> ground

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.359 

using<00:00:15.809> gravel<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> will<00:00:16.800> fall<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.039> top

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
using gravel because it will fall on top

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.940 
using gravel because it will fall on top
of<00:00:17.430> itself

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
of itself

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.360 
of itself
and<00:00:19.040> I<00:00:19.540> couldn't<00:00:20.540> find<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:21.050> good<00:00:21.830> design<00:00:22.130> for

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
and I couldn't find a good design for

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.610 
and I couldn't find a good design for
one<00:00:22.520> anywhere<00:00:22.850> all<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.210> 3<00:00:23.450> by<00:00:23.600> 3<00:00:23.630> doors<00:00:24.050> are

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
one anywhere all the 3 by 3 doors are

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.500 
one anywhere all the 3 by 3 doors are
the<00:00:24.890> only<00:00:25.040> three<00:00:25.250> by<00:00:25.430> three<00:00:25.640> door<00:00:25.820> I<00:00:25.850> saw<00:00:26.240> had

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
the only three by three door I saw had

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.450 
the only three by three door I saw had
an<00:00:26.630> exposed<00:00:27.050> pissed<00:00:27.380> in<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:27.770> took<00:00:28.010> forever<00:00:28.220> to

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
an exposed pissed in it took forever to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.060 
an exposed pissed in it took forever to
open<00:00:29.260> and<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.410> knew<00:00:30.530> there<00:00:30.710> was<00:00:30.830> a<00:00:30.860> way<00:00:31.040> to

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
open and I knew there was a way to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.270 
open and I knew there was a way to
activate<00:00:31.430> three<00:00:32.200> pistons<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.350> sequence<00:00:33.830> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
activate three pistons and sequence and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.380 
activate three pistons and sequence and
I<00:00:34.340> wanted<00:00:34.580> to<00:00:34.730> figure<00:00:34.880> out<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:35.120> way<00:00:35.330> so<00:00:36.430> I've<00:00:37.430> got

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I wanted to figure out a way so I've got

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.280 
I wanted to figure out a way so I've got
it<00:00:39.899> opens<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.590> slowly<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> closes

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it opens a little slowly but it closes

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it opens a little slowly but it closes
pretty<00:00:43.530> good

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
pretty good

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.070 
pretty good
I<00:00:45.430> could<00:00:45.850> probably<00:00:45.940> do<00:00:46.450> something<00:00:46.720> about<00:00:46.930> that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
I could probably do something about that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.810 
I could probably do something about that
delay<00:00:47.440> between<00:00:47.830> hitting<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.400> button<00:00:48.550> and

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
delay between hitting the button and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.740 
delay between hitting the button and
having<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.240> work<00:00:49.690> but<00:00:50.080> it<00:00:50.860> works<00:00:51.070> so

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
having it work but it works so

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:02.520 
having it work but it works so
oops<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.700> should<00:00:54.700> have<00:00:54.790> gone<00:00:54.850> through<00:00:55.090> there

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.660 

okay<00:01:03.309> so

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
okay so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.170 
okay so
I'm<00:01:05.600> never<00:01:05.840> going<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.080> be<00:01:06.200> able<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.500> explain

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
I'm never going to be able to explain

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.850 
I'm never going to be able to explain
how<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.240> build<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.720> that's<00:01:09.350> not<00:01:09.619> what<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
how to build it that's not what the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.859 
how to build it that's not what the
purpose<00:01:10.159> of<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:10.340> video<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.790> for<00:01:11.299> but<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.600> will

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
purpose of this video is for but I will

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.780 
purpose of this video is for but I will
explain<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.380> how<00:01:12.439> it<00:01:12.740> works<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.369> can

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
explain to you how it works and you can

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.670 
explain to you how it works and you can
try<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.060> build<00:01:14.299> your<00:01:14.540> own<00:01:16.060> so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.680 

there's<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.310> pair<00:01:21.610> of<00:01:21.700> buttons<00:01:22.000> up<00:01:22.210> there<00:01:22.450> and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
there's a pair of buttons up there and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.130 
there's a pair of buttons up there and
they<00:01:23.140> both<00:01:23.320> lead<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.770> this<00:01:23.890> redstone<00:01:24.280> wire<00:01:24.670> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
they both lead to this redstone wire and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.290 
they both lead to this redstone wire and
that<00:01:26.140> activates<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.980> T<00:01:27.250> flip-flop<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.150> that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
that activates this T flip-flop so that

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.050 
that activates this T flip-flop so that
those<00:01:28.510> redstone<00:01:29.050> buttons<00:01:29.470> act<00:01:29.770> as<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.550> toggle

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
those redstone buttons act as a toggle

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.240 
those redstone buttons act as a toggle
you<00:01:32.479> turn<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.810> machine<00:01:33.110> on<00:01:33.140> or<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.829> turn<00:01:34.009> you

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
you turn the machine on or you turn you

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.100 
you turn the machine on or you turn you
open<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.790> or<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.060> close<00:01:35.329> it<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.540> open<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.960> or

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
open it or you close it you open it or

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.640 
open it or you close it you open it or
close<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.560> no<00:01:36.979> matter<00:01:37.159> what<00:01:37.280> button<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.790> hit

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
close it no matter what button you hit

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.070 
close it no matter what button you hit
and<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:40.400> leads<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.880> down<00:01:41.150> here<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:41.720> I've<00:01:41.900> got

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
and that leads to down here so I've got

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.950 
and that leads to down here so I've got
three

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.530 

three<00:01:47.590> pistons<00:01:48.040> are<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.370> three<00:01:48.850> by<00:01:49.000> three<00:01:49.030> set

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
three pistons are a three by three set

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.750 
three pistons are a three by three set
of<00:01:49.630> Pistons<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:50.170> will<00:01:50.380> lift<00:01:50.560> up<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:51.010> this<00:01:51.430> 3

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
of Pistons that will lift up this this 3

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.630 
of Pistons that will lift up this this 3
by<00:01:51.909> 3<00:01:51.940> set<00:01:52.540> of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
by 3 set of

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.710 
by 3 set of
of<00:01:55.000> gravel<00:01:55.479> block<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:56.560> works<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:57.070> so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
of gravel block and it works like so

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.570 
of gravel block and it works like so
and<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.290> way<00:01:59.410> you<00:01:59.470> have<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.830> do<00:01:59.980> it<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.310> when

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
and the way you have to do it is when

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.880 
and the way you have to do it is when
it's<00:02:00.730> going<00:02:00.940> up<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.690> bottom<00:02:02.110> has<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.530> activate

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
it's going up the bottom has to activate

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.910 
it's going up the bottom has to activate
first

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
first

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.940 
first
when<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.820> down<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.810> top<00:02:07.439> has<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
when it's going down the top has to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.410 
when it's going down the top has to
deactivate<00:02:08.280> first<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> has<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.110> order

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
deactivate first and has to go in order

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.250 
deactivate first and has to go in order
and<00:02:11.930> that's<00:02:12.200> because

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.470 

open<00:02:16.260> pistons<00:02:17.010> cannot<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.550> moved<00:02:17.760> by<00:02:18.240> other

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
open pistons cannot be moved by other

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.230 
open pistons cannot be moved by other
Pistons<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> limitations<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
Pistons it's one of the limitations of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.559 
Pistons it's one of the limitations of
Pistons<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.580> mmm<00:02:24.230> excuse<00:02:25.230> me

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
Pistons so mmm excuse me

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.080 
Pistons so mmm excuse me
the<00:02:27.569> way<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> had<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.170> do<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:29.519> split<00:02:29.909> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the way I had to do it is you split the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.360 
the way I had to do it is you split the
signal<00:02:30.510> off<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.500> bottom<00:02:31.680> ones<00:02:32.040> pretty

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
signal off the the bottom ones pretty

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.350 
signal off the the bottom ones pretty
simple<00:02:33.470> because<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.709> signal<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.879> turns<00:02:36.180> it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
simple because the signal that turns it

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.380 
simple because the signal that turns it
on<00:02:36.480> we'll<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.890> first<00:02:38.610> it'll<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
on we'll go to it first it'll be the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.780 
on we'll go to it first it'll be the
first<00:02:39.540> signal<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.260> anywhere<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.640> one

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
first signal to get anywhere and the one

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.759 
first signal to get anywhere and the one
that<00:02:41.970> turns<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.450> off<00:02:42.599> has<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> really<00:02:43.319> good<00:02:43.409> long

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
that turns it off has a really good long

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.580 
that turns it off has a really good long
delay<00:02:44.190> circuit<00:02:44.670> down<00:02:44.879> here<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.510> it'll<00:02:46.319> always

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
delay circuit down here and it'll always

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
delay circuit down here and it'll always
get<00:02:46.920> turned<00:02:47.190> off<00:02:47.370> last<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:50.040> middle<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.519> was<00:02:50.940> a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
get turned off last the middle one was a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.670 
get turned off last the middle one was a
little<00:02:51.269> tricky<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.750> activated<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.500> two

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
little tricky it's activated on two

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.090 
little tricky it's activated on two
sides

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
sides

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.940 
sides
but<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.210> one<00:02:55.480> only<00:02:55.720> activates<00:02:56.380> when<00:02:56.830> it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
but this one only activates when it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.860 
but this one only activates when it
closes<00:02:57.220> or<00:02:57.670> when<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.940> opens<00:02:58.330> not<00:02:58.570> when<00:02:58.780> it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
closes or when it opens not when it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.080 
closes or when it opens not when it
closes<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.710> one<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.610> make<00:03:00.850> sure<00:03:01.060> that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
closes so this one just make sure that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.390 
closes so this one just make sure that
when<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.660> goes<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.230> close<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
when it goes to close that it's the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.320 
when it goes to close that it's the
second<00:03:03.790> one<00:03:03.850> activated

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
second one activated

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.680 
second one activated
and<00:03:06.450> that's<00:03:06.930> pretty<00:03:07.170> straightforward

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.050 

but<00:03:10.380> there's<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.740> tricky<00:03:11.100> thing<00:03:11.130> about<00:03:11.340> pistons

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
but there's a tricky thing about pistons

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.380 
but there's a tricky thing about pistons
and<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.870> they<00:03:13.560> can't

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and that they can't

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.630 
and that they can't
not<00:03:16.319> only<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:16.890> move<00:03:17.280> them<00:03:17.460> when

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
not only can you not move them when

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.550 
not only can you not move them when
they're<00:03:17.760> open<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:18.569> can't<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.410> have

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
they're open but they can't if you have

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440 
they're open but they can't if you have
three<00:03:19.860> pistons<00:03:20.280> connected<00:03:20.760> together<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.360> you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
three pistons connected together and you

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
three pistons connected together and you
pull<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.110> bottom<00:03:22.319> piston<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.580> to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
pull the bottom piston it's not going to

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.670 
pull the bottom piston it's not going to
move<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.120> Pistons<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.630> piston<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.350> attached

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
move the Pistons that piston is attached

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.050 
move the Pistons that piston is attached
to<00:03:25.819> so

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.470 

top<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:31.050> will<00:03:31.319> retract<00:03:31.709> first<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:33.060> bottom

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
top one will retract first the bottom

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.500 
top one will retract first the bottom
one<00:03:33.660> will<00:03:33.870> retract<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.880> middle<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.300> will

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
one will retract the middle one will

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.449 
one will retract the middle one will
retract<00:03:36.870> second<00:03:37.410> pulling<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.800> top<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.250> down

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
retract second pulling the top one down

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.460 
retract second pulling the top one down
and<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.000> bottom<00:03:39.150> one<00:03:39.510> will<00:03:39.750> retract<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
and then the bottom one will retract the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.490 
and then the bottom one will retract the
middle<00:03:40.709> one<00:03:40.860> down<00:03:41.150> then<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.510> pulse<00:03:42.900> has<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.349> go

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
middle one down then a pulse has to go

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.040 
middle one down then a pulse has to go
through<00:03:43.890> only<00:03:44.160> when<00:03:44.610> it's<00:03:44.760> closing<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.900> make

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
through only when it's closing to make

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.640 
through only when it's closing to make
the<00:03:46.200> middle<00:03:46.380> one<00:03:46.709> come<00:03:47.400> up<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.730> grab<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.650> top

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
the middle one come up and grab the top

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.400 
the middle one come up and grab the top
one<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.160> pull<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.550> down

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
one and pull it down

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.920 
one and pull it down
so<00:03:52.830> there<00:03:53.010> goes<00:03:53.280> up<00:03:53.490> nice<00:03:53.910> smooth<00:03:54.210> motion

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.490 

and<00:03:58.230> there<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.799> pulls<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.549> the<00:04:00.209> middle

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
and there it pulls the the middle

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.140 
and there it pulls the the middle
that<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.860> middle<00:04:02.070> row<00:04:02.280> goes<00:04:02.550> up<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.910> pulls

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
that the middle row goes up and pulls

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.140 
that the middle row goes up and pulls
the<00:04:03.330> top<00:04:03.570> row<00:04:03.840> down

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.420 

the<00:04:08.150> way<00:04:08.330> I<00:04:08.360> did<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.959> was<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:09.680> when<00:04:09.980> you

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
the way I did that was that when you

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.080 
the way I did that was that when you
turn<00:04:10.760> on<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.540> off<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.470> signal<00:04:12.769> i<00:04:13.129> created<00:04:13.940> a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
turn on and off the signal i created a

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.629 
turn on and off the signal i created a
on

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.759 

and<00:04:16.729> on<00:04:17.209> pulse<00:04:17.719> generator<00:04:18.229> so<00:04:18.499> when<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
and on pulse generator so when the

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.489 
and on pulse generator so when the
signal<00:04:18.949> turns<00:04:19.370> on<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:20.239> this<00:04:20.749> creates<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.259> pulse

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:21.499 
signal turns on it this creates a pulse

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.110 
signal turns on it this creates a pulse
and<00:04:21.769> sends<00:04:22.099> it<00:04:22.189> through<00:04:22.219> there<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.879> when<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
and sends it through there and when the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.209 
and sends it through there and when the
signal<00:04:23.389> turns<00:04:23.780> off<00:04:24.050> this<00:04:24.409> inverted<00:04:24.860> pulse

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:25.219 
signal turns off this inverted pulse

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.989 
signal turns off this inverted pulse
generator<00:04:25.729> will<00:04:26.689> send<00:04:27.349> a<00:04:27.469> signal<00:04:27.999> through

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:28.999 
generator will send a signal through

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.879 
generator will send a signal through
there<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.419> this<00:04:29.569> has<00:04:29.749> to<00:04:29.930> happen<00:04:29.960> after<00:04:30.770> the

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
there and this has to happen after the

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.309 
there and this has to happen after the
whole<00:04:31.039> thing<00:04:31.279> has<00:04:31.310> retracted<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.389> there's<00:04:33.259> a

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
whole thing has retracted so there's a

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.869 
whole thing has retracted so there's a
lot<00:04:33.499> of<00:04:33.560> delay<00:04:33.889> that<00:04:34.129> comes<00:04:34.370> through<00:04:34.610> here

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
lot of delay that comes through here

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.050 
lot of delay that comes through here
that<00:04:35.719> that<00:04:36.020> pulse<00:04:36.379> also<00:04:37.039> goes<00:04:37.310> down<00:04:37.610> through

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
that that pulse also goes down through

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.999 
that that pulse also goes down through
this<00:04:38.449> route<00:04:39.139> and<00:04:39.639> out<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:42.110> where<00:04:42.349> this<00:04:42.560> piston

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
this route and out to where this piston

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.010 
this route and out to where this piston
is<00:04:43.129> blocking<00:04:43.580> it

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
is blocking it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.749 
is blocking it
to<00:04:45.560> activate<00:04:46.180> those<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.569> so<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:49.039> pulse<00:04:49.370> only

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
to activate those and so that pulse only

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.749 
to activate those and so that pulse only
can<00:04:50.150> go<00:04:50.300> through<00:04:50.690> when<00:04:51.050> it<00:04:51.199> opens<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:52.129> can't<00:04:52.520> go

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
can go through when it opens it can't go

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.520 
can go through when it opens it can't go
through<00:04:53.030> when<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.389> closes<00:04:53.659> otherwise<00:04:54.259> it<00:04:54.500> just

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
through when it closes otherwise it just

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.700 
through when it closes otherwise it just
breaks<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.210> have<00:04:56.569> another<00:04:56.840> tea<00:04:57.169> flip<00:04:57.440> flop

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
breaks so I have another tea flip flop

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.939 
breaks so I have another tea flip flop
over<00:04:57.949> here<00:04:58.539> and<00:04:59.539> that<00:04:59.750> T<00:04:59.990> flip<00:05:00.259> flop<00:05:00.500> powers

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
over here and that T flip flop powers

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.640 
over here and that T flip flop powers
this<00:05:01.159> piston<00:05:01.699> and<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.569> had<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.900> very<00:05:03.139> tricky

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
this piston and I had the very tricky

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.770 
this piston and I had the very tricky
set<00:05:03.889> of<00:05:04.009> delays<00:05:04.340> so<00:05:04.699> that<00:05:04.849> this<00:05:05.030> piston<00:05:05.539> will

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
set of delays so that this piston will

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.730 
set of delays so that this piston will
activate<00:05:06.409> when

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
activate when

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.490 
activate when
will<00:05:09.370> activate<00:05:09.910> every<00:05:10.150> other<00:05:10.690> time<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.349> that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
will activate every other time and that

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.680 
will activate every other time and that
causes<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:12.220> pulse<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.789> go<00:05:12.940> through<00:05:13.240> here<00:05:13.569> and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
causes that pulse to go through here and

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.600 
causes that pulse to go through here and
activate<00:05:14.139> these<00:05:14.319> middle<00:05:14.650> Pistons<00:05:15.099> every

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
activate these middle Pistons every

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.800 
activate these middle Pistons every
other<00:05:15.759> time

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
other time

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.090 
other time
the<00:05:17.230> button<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.620> pressed

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.490 

and<00:05:20.190> then<00:05:20.790> there<00:05:21.000> was<00:05:21.150> one<00:05:21.180> last<00:05:21.690> tricky<00:05:22.260> thing

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
and then there was one last tricky thing

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.370 
and then there was one last tricky thing
that<00:05:22.740> I<00:05:22.770> had<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.280> solve<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.880> that<00:05:24.240> was<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:25.050> the

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
that I had to solve and that was the the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.890 
that I had to solve and that was the the
top<00:05:25.620> pistons<00:05:25.980> when<00:05:26.520> they<00:05:26.700> accept<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.750> way

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
top pistons when they accept the way

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.320 
top pistons when they accept the way
that<00:05:28.110> they<00:05:28.260> extend<00:05:28.800> is<00:05:29.150> by<00:05:30.150> popping<00:05:30.870> up<00:05:31.250> to

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
that they extend is by popping up to

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.960 
that they extend is by popping up to
here<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.480> lighting<00:05:34.230> up<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.650> without<00:05:35.460> this

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
here and lighting up and without this

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.810 
here and lighting up and without this
mechanism<00:05:36.510> that<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.110> have<00:05:37.380> right<00:05:37.650> here<00:05:37.820> they

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
mechanism that I have right here they

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.420 
mechanism that I have right here they
would<00:05:39.000> just<00:05:39.270> as<00:05:39.450> soon<00:05:39.480> as<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.380> middle<00:05:40.770> pistons

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
would just as soon as the middle pistons

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.060 
would just as soon as the middle pistons
as<00:05:42.910> soon<00:05:43.180> as<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.420> middle<00:05:43.690> Pistons<00:05:44.170> push<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
as soon as the middle Pistons push the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.340 
as soon as the middle Pistons push the
top<00:05:45.310> pistons<00:05:45.700> into<00:05:46.180> that<00:05:46.300> position<00:05:46.540> they

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
top pistons into that position they

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.900 
top pistons into that position they
would<00:05:47.500> instantly<00:05:47.920> expand<00:05:48.520> there's<00:05:48.790> oh

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
would instantly expand there's oh

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.670 
would instantly expand there's oh
there's<00:05:49.180> a<00:05:49.240> glitch<00:05:49.600> where<00:05:49.960> they

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
there's a glitch where they

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.189 
there's a glitch where they
instantly<00:05:52.580> expand<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.389> I<00:05:53.419> needed<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:53.960> put<00:05:54.169> a

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
instantly expand so I needed to put a

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.010 
instantly expand so I needed to put a
delay<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.820> they<00:05:56.150> activated<00:05:56.750> after<00:05:59.020> after

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
delay so that they activated after after

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.900 
delay so that they activated after after
the<00:06:00.169> other<00:06:00.350> three<00:06:00.710> activated<00:06:01.430> so<00:06:01.580> it<00:06:01.669> was<00:06:01.789> the

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
the other three activated so it was the

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.170 
the other three activated so it was the
last<00:06:02.090> one<00:06:02.419> to<00:06:02.660> get<00:06:03.620> power<00:06:03.889> up<00:06:04.220> there<00:06:04.490> but<00:06:05.090> at

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
last one to get power up there but at

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.969 
last one to get power up there but at
the<00:06:05.300> same<00:06:05.479> time<00:06:05.720> in<00:06:06.020> order<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.380> retract<00:06:06.770> the

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
the same time in order to retract the

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.980 
the same time in order to retract the
whole<00:06:07.130> thing<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.789> had<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.300> be<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.509> first<00:06:08.750> one

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
whole thing it had to be the first one

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.210 
whole thing it had to be the first one
to<00:06:09.020> retract<00:06:09.530> so<00:06:10.009> I<00:06:11.199> created<00:06:12.199> this<00:06:12.620> piston

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
to retract so I created this piston

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.279 
to retract so I created this piston
which<00:06:13.699> is<00:06:13.910> the<00:06:14.210> first<00:06:14.449> piston<00:06:14.900> in<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.110> whole

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
which is the first piston in the whole

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.370 
which is the first piston in the whole
sequence<00:06:15.680> to<00:06:16.009> move<00:06:16.250> it<00:06:17.030> will<00:06:17.300> turn<00:06:17.870> on<00:06:18.050> and

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
sequence to move it will turn on and

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.749 
sequence to move it will turn on and
turn<00:06:18.530> off<00:06:18.590> this<00:06:19.070> wire<00:06:20.650> that<00:06:21.650> comes<00:06:21.949> after<00:06:22.610> the

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
turn off this wire that comes after the

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.010 
turn off this wire that comes after the
delay<00:06:23.120> so<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.320> delay<00:06:24.620> for<00:06:25.039> making<00:06:25.370> it<00:06:26.020> get

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
delay so the delay for making it get

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.409 
delay so the delay for making it get
bigger<00:06:27.259> this<00:06:27.620> piston<00:06:28.009> retracts<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:28.729> the

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
bigger this piston retracts and the

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.300 
bigger this piston retracts and the
signal<00:06:29.840> goes<00:06:29.870> through<00:06:30.320> the<00:06:30.440> delay<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:31.070> then

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
signal goes through the delay and then

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.339 
signal goes through the delay and then
once<00:06:31.849> that<00:06:31.940> piston<00:06:32.449> is<00:06:32.570> in<00:06:32.599> place<00:06:32.990> then

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
once that piston is in place then

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.559 
once that piston is in place then
activates<00:06:33.949> the<00:06:34.130> piston

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
activates the piston

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.389 
activates the piston
when<00:06:36.050> you<00:06:36.169> go<00:06:36.349> when<00:06:36.619> you<00:06:36.710> turn<00:06:36.949> the<00:06:36.979> power<00:06:37.249> off

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
when you go when you turn the power off

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.730 
when you go when you turn the power off
when<00:06:37.969> it<00:06:38.059> goes<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.270> retract<00:06:38.749> this<00:06:39.199> piston

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
when it goes to retract this piston

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.369 
when it goes to retract this piston
instantly<00:06:40.309> closes<00:06:40.909> this<00:06:41.089> circuit<00:06:41.599> and<00:06:41.779> that

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:42.379 
instantly closes this circuit and that

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.350 
instantly closes this circuit and that
signal<00:06:42.710> is<00:06:43.009> turned<00:06:43.279> off<00:06:43.460> with<00:06:43.819> almost<00:06:44.089> no

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
signal is turned off with almost no

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.909 
signal is turned off with almost no
