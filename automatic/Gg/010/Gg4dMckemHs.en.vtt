00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and here in support of the internship we

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.730 
and here in support of the internship we
were<00:00:08.519> wrong<00:00:08.820> all<00:00:09.389> right<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.690> now<00:00:09.750> we've<00:00:10.050> got<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
were wrong all right and now we've got a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.770 
were wrong all right and now we've got a
couple<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.219> different<00:00:11.550> kinds<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.059> motors<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
couple of different kinds of motors and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.079 
couple of different kinds of motors and
pieces<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.170> motors<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:13.920> right<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.910> so

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
pieces of motors here right and and so

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.000 
pieces of motors here right and and so
first<00:00:15.780> let's<00:00:16.049> talk<00:00:16.199> about<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.800> here

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
first let's talk about this one here

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.800 
first let's talk about this one here
what<00:00:17.400> happened<00:00:18.770> become<00:00:19.770> catastrophic<00:00:20.100> fill

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
what happened become catastrophic fill

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.620 
what happened become catastrophic fill
the<00:00:21.810> exhaust<00:00:22.140> valve<00:00:22.470> broke<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.480> internally<00:00:24.480> in

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the exhaust valve broke on internally in

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.400 
the exhaust valve broke on internally in
the<00:00:24.750> cylinder<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:26.180> it<00:00:27.180> bounces<00:00:27.599> around<00:00:27.720> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the cylinder and it bounces around as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
the cylinder and it bounces around as
the<00:00:28.710> engine<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.400> operation<00:00:30.349> resulted<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
operation and the loose art created the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
operation and the loose art created the
damage<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> festive<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.660> silver<00:00:36.989> head

similar<00:01:36.280> failure<00:01:36.760> curve<00:01:37.120> we<00:01:37.300> had<00:01:37.650> broken

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
similar failure curve we had broken

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.300 
similar failure curve we had broken
valve<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.130> some<00:01:39.340> kind<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.930> also<00:01:41.110> beat<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.100> top

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
valve of some kind it also beat the top

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.880 
valve of some kind it also beat the top
of<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.520> piston<00:01:42.730> in<00:01:43.090> now<00:01:43.720> you've<00:01:44.260> got<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
of the piston in now you've got the the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.090 
of the piston in now you've got the the
piston<00:01:46.080> siwan<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.260> in<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.530> cylinder<00:01:47.980> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
piston siwan is in the cylinder the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.060 
piston siwan is in the cylinder the
silver<00:01:48.520> cylinder<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.180> suffering<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.080> muslim

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
silver cylinder and suffering a muslim

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.180 
silver cylinder and suffering a muslim
failure<00:01:51.490> also<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:51.970> don't<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.860> kind<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.130> looks

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
failure also I don't it kind of looks

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.180 
failure also I don't it kind of looks
like<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.720> piece<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.680> stranded

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
like is that the piece of stranded

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.730 
like is that the piece of stranded
occupy<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.820> same<00:01:58.120> spot<00:01:58.360> design<00:01:59.200> complexity

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
occupy the same spot design complexity

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.060 
occupy the same spot design complexity
right<00:02:00.310> inside<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.720> that's<00:02:01.840> work<00:02:02.140> when<00:02:02.380> so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
right inside and that's work when so

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.800
