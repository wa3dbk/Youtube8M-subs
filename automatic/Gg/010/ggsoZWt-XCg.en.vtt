and<00:06:27.849> feeding<00:06:28.479> frenzy<00:06:28.839> kills<00:06:29.050> with<00:06:29.169> this

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
and feeding frenzy kills with this

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.740 
and feeding frenzy kills with this
weapon<00:06:29.529> increase<00:06:30.129> reload<00:06:30.580> speed<00:06:30.819> for<00:06:31.479> a<00:06:31.509> short

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750
