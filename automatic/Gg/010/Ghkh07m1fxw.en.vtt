00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

five<00:00:00.299> now<00:00:00.810> we're<00:00:01.050> working<00:00:01.199> with<00:00:01.469> division

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
five now we're working with division

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.220 
five now we're working with division
remember<00:00:02.730> that<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.090> order<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.540> divide<00:00:03.810> what<00:00:04.200> I

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
remember that in order to divide what I

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.720 
remember that in order to divide what I
need<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.920> multiply<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.870> divisor<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.730> the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
need is to multiply the divisor and the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.129 
need is to multiply the divisor and the
dividend<00:00:11.809> by<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.870> conjugate<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.670> divisor

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
dividend by the conjugate of the divisor

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:24.400 
dividend by the conjugate of the divisor
okay<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.320> i'm<00:00:22.560> looking<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.279> four<00:00:23.609> plus<00:00:23.910> 2i

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
okay so i'm looking here at four plus 2i

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.320 
okay so i'm looking here at four plus 2i
its<00:00:25.410> conjugate<00:00:26.160> its<00:00:27.119> complex<00:00:27.720> conjugate<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
its conjugate its complex conjugate is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330 
its conjugate its complex conjugate is
4-2<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.260> i<00:00:31.470> need<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.830> multiply<00:00:31.980> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
4-2 I so i need to multiply this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.610 
4-2 I so i need to multiply this
numerator<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> denominator<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:35.270> 4<00:00:36.270> minus<00:00:36.420> 2i

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.709 

okay<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.129> numerator<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> go

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
okay in the numerator I'm going to go

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.580 
okay in the numerator I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.800> my<00:00:46.980> foil<00:00:47.629> first<00:00:48.629> gives<00:00:49.230> me<00:00:51.590> two

squared<00:01:13.100> now<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> denominator<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.939> act

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
squared now in the denominator I can act

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
squared now in the denominator I can act
I<00:01:18.360> could<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.960> foil<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.409> multiply<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.040> or

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I could use foil and multiply it out or

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.330 
I could use foil and multiply it out or
I<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:20.580> remember<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.330> i<00:01:21.450> multiply

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
I could remember that if i multiply

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
I could remember that if i multiply
complex<00:01:23.340> conjugates<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.210> plus<00:01:24.570> bi<00:01:24.810> times<00:01:25.710> a

minus<00:01:26.189> bi<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> end<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.140> with

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
minus bi what I'm going to end up with

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.920 
minus bi what I'm going to end up with
is<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:29.329> squared<00:01:30.710> plus<00:01:31.710> B<00:01:31.740> squared<00:01:32.210> now<00:01:33.210> looking

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
is a squared plus B squared now looking

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
is a squared plus B squared now looking
at<00:01:34.110> four<00:01:34.380> plus<00:01:34.590> two<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.030> hear<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.180> equals<00:01:37.140> 4<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> B

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
at four plus two I hear a equals 4 and B

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
at four plus two I hear a equals 4 and B
equals<00:01:39.150> two<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> let<00:01:40.860> me<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.130> take<00:01:41.340> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
equals two so let me just take that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480 
equals two so let me just take that
shortcut<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.360> say<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
shortcut and say that I then have a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.499 
shortcut and say that I then have a
squared<00:01:45.409> which<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.439> 4<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> 4<00:01:49.560> squared<00:01:50.130> plus<00:01:50.700> B

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
squared which is 4 so 4 squared plus B

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.389 
squared which is 4 so 4 squared plus B
squared<00:01:51.540> which<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.320> 2<00:01:52.680> squared<00:01:53.070> okay<00:01:54.350> now

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
squared which is 2 squared okay now

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.530 
squared which is 2 squared okay now
simplifying<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.640> numerator<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.329> further

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
simplifying the numerator a bit further

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.030 
simplifying the numerator a bit further
gives<00:01:58.049> me<00:01:58.259> 8<00:01:58.799> negative<00:01:59.729> 4i<00:02:00.320> minus<00:02:01.320> 12i<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
gives me 8 negative 4i minus 12i is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.260 
gives me 8 negative 4i minus 12i is
negative<00:02:02.549> 16<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.180> plus<00:02:04.110> 6i<00:02:04.560> squared<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
negative 16 I plus 6i squared in the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.979 
negative 16 I plus 6i squared in the
denominator<00:02:06.829> 4<00:02:07.829> squared<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.220> 16<00:02:08.429> +<00:02:09.030> 2<00:02:09.840> squared

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
denominator 4 squared is 16 + 2 squared

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.460 
denominator 4 squared is 16 + 2 squared
is<00:02:10.229> 4

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
is 4

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.110 
is 4
okay<00:02:13.070> recall<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.090> i<00:02:14.570> squared<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:17.650> negative<00:02:18.650> 1

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
okay recall that i squared is negative 1

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.200 
okay recall that i squared is negative 1
so<00:02:20.120> i'm<00:02:20.210> going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.390> substitute<00:02:21.850> negative<00:02:22.850> 1

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
so i'm going to substitute negative 1

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
so i'm going to substitute negative 1
here

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.860 

the<00:02:29.769> denominator<00:02:30.340> I've<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.760> got<00:02:30.940> 16<00:02:31.420> plus<00:02:31.629> 4

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the denominator I've just got 16 plus 4

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.320 
the denominator I've just got 16 plus 4
is<00:02:31.959> 20<00:02:33.840> okay<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.110> gives<00:02:35.260> me<00:02:36.569> 8-16<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:39.330> this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
is 20 okay so this gives me 8-16 I this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.059 
is 20 okay so this gives me 8-16 I this
is<00:02:40.540> negative<00:02:40.780> 6<00:02:41.470> over<00:02:42.299> 20<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:44.650> simplify<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
is negative 6 over 20 I can simplify a

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.809 
is negative 6 over 20 I can simplify a
bit<00:02:45.310> more<00:02:45.519> because<00:02:45.760> 8-6<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.900> too<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:47.860> 2-16

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
bit more because 8-6 is too this is 2-16

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.300 
bit more because 8-6 is too this is 2-16
I<00:02:49.180> over<00:02:50.140> 20<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.190> my<00:02:51.849> solution<00:02:52.560> okay<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.040> in

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I over 20 is my solution okay so in

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.520 
I over 20 is my solution okay so in
order<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.700> simplify<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.750> took<00:02:56.049> the
