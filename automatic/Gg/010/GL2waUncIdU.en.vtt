00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
 bulls assault same one well forgive mini cooper 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.170
 we thought a small size a 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.849
 This is all a tribute to fashion and rush code if here is not 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:09.729
 an exception 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.629
 and these are completed with ultra modern 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.559
 engines from the Volkswagen deck and Skoda 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.320
 and challenge and here is such a label 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.130
 Severstal 4 4 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.619
 on the back door cover it will be 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.449
 of course inspire pride owners 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.210
 such a car but because you are in such 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 case of times you drive a car calmly 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.419
 sticker Yeltsin most modern on 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.239
 currently the car with the most 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.180
 modern technology and ultra 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.110
 modern standards 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 environmental friendliness 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 originally Skoda Yeti it would seem 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.830
 front wheel drive car because 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.850
 96 percent torque 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.489
 falls on the front wheels but 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.550
 This is the case if the road surface 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.930
 dry if something went imbalance in 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 circulation between the front and rear 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.020
 wheels in the case comes specially 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.340
 but profitable hydraulic clutch 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.620
 holdings which immediately starts 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.809
 distribute torque 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.140
 depending on the traffic situation 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.080
 sometimes translating up to 90 percent of the rotating 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.380
 torque on rear wheel drive for increased 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.530
 off-road stability 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.840
 here is Skoda Yeti 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.250
 applied special cross 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 23 millimeter stabilizer 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.780
 in diameter such a metal thing 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.390
 which saves us from serious customers 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 so what do skoda yeti suv 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 this all-wheel drive system 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.130
 inherited from school rocks or superb 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.720
 so Skoda Yeti is actually 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.920
 something very similar 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 Park many options for example 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.190
 by quality by size 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.240
 and other things she Volkswagen Tiguan 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.520
 i.e. this little crossover 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 made 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.930
 passat 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.280
 intrinsic to Germans and Czechs pedantry 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.119
 good quality material apparently 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.880
 here 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.149
 and a full set of security systems 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.700
 are needed 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.020
 these days just any car 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.789
 manual transmission with us 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.670
 presented on all Skoda her heart 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.310
 except perhaps the smallest 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.460
 why this car is the top version 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.179
 engine power of this 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.369
 specific personality of the writer horse 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 force 1 8 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.999
 I think the car 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.029
 and economically 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.399
 single-handedly 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.219
 what happens infrequently 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.749
 here and attempt to shut up speaking 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:34.449
 sort out 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.969
 in plot 1 will pass forward turbine 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.679
 makes itself felt immediately 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:39.909
 v8 thrusters
