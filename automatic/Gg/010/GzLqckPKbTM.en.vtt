00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
we can go ahead and research something -

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.900 
we can go ahead and research something -
why<00:02:36.360> don't<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.620> let's<00:02:37.620> let's<00:02:38.250> research<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
why don't we let's let's research the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.970 
why don't we let's let's research the
Wizards<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.260> we're<00:02:40.410> actually<00:02:40.560> gonna<00:02:40.740> be<00:02:40.860> able

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
Wizards so we're actually gonna be able

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.450 
Wizards so we're actually gonna be able
to<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.220> three<00:02:41.580> upgrades<00:02:43.370> hopefully<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:46.460> ya

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
to do three upgrades hopefully we can ya

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.860 
to do three upgrades hopefully we can ya
get<00:02:47.670> another<00:02:47.850> good<00:02:48.090> one<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.420> we're<00:02:48.570> gonna<00:02:48.660> go

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
get another good one so we're gonna go

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.260 
get another good one so we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.380> actually<00:02:50.010> train<00:02:50.460> up<00:02:50.670> troops<00:02:50.970> guys

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270

before<00:02:51.570> one<00:02:51.960> thing<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.380> should<00:02:52.410> always

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
before one thing that you should always

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.820 
before one thing that you should always
do<00:02:53.100> before<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.150> into<00:02:54.360> battle<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.960> train<00:02:55.650> up

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
do before you go into battle is train up

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.190 
do before you go into battle is train up
your<00:02:55.860> troops<00:02:56.280> I've<00:02:57.060> been<00:02:57.240> doing<00:02:57.420> eight<00:02:57.600> Giants

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
your troops I've been doing eight Giants

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.440 
your troops I've been doing eight Giants
and<00:02:58.380> five<00:02:58.980> wallbreakers<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.060> account

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
and five wallbreakers on this account

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.240 
and five wallbreakers on this account
and<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.320> I've<00:03:01.440> been<00:03:01.560> switching<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.220> between

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and then I've been switching in between

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.210 
and then I've been switching in between
doing<00:03:02.940> like<00:03:03.240> thirty<00:03:03.960> archers<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:06.180> four

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
doing like thirty archers and like four

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.240 
doing like thirty archers and like four
wizards<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:09.500> splitting<00:03:10.500> between<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
wizards and then splitting between the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
wizards and then splitting between the
remaining<00:03:11.810> barbarians<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.950> goblins<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.030> as

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
remaining barbarians and goblins and as

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.790 
remaining barbarians and goblins and as
you<00:03:15.570> can<00:03:15.690> see<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.990> number<00:03:16.230> right<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:16.470> says

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
you can see the number right now says

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.330 
you can see the number right now says
271<00:03:17.580> what<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.120> want<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.340> 270

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
271 what we want to go for is 270

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.050 
271 what we want to go for is 270
because<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:20.850> 135<00:03:21.540> plus<00:03:22.190> 135<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.730> there's<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
because that's 135 plus 135 so there's a

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820 
because that's 135 plus 135 so there's a
little<00:03:24.210> bit<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.420> math<00:03:24.600> for<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.990> we're<00:03:25.710> gonna

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
little bit of math for you we're gonna

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.980 
little bit of math for you we're gonna
go<00:03:25.950> ahead<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.460> attack<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.060> see<00:03:27.450> what<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.810> can

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
go ahead and attack and see what we can

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.960 
go ahead and attack and see what we can
find<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:29.390> I'm<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.530> ahead<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.250> cut

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
find and I'm going to go ahead and cut

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.670 
find and I'm going to go ahead and cut
the<00:03:33.090> video<00:03:33.240> here<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.840> I'll<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.230> back<00:03:34.350> with<00:03:34.560> you
