unfortunately<00:03:08.959> they<00:03:09.260> got<00:03:09.530> recon<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.220> we

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
unfortunately they got recon and we

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.030 
unfortunately they got recon and we
don't<00:03:10.459> have<00:03:10.580> our<00:03:10.610> camel<00:03:11.060> class<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.680> teammates

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
don't have our camel class so teammates

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.030

Betty<00:03:13.280> helped<00:03:13.790> us<00:03:13.880> out<00:03:14.030> there

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.970 

and<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:18.640> actually<00:03:18.670> heard<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.060> guy<00:03:19.450> up<00:03:19.870> top<00:03:20.170> so

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
and we actually heard that guy up top so

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.830 
and we actually heard that guy up top so
I<00:03:21.040> survival<00:03:21.460> it<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.700> way<00:03:21.850> now<00:03:22.450> when<00:03:22.780> they

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
I survival it that way now when they

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.900 
I survival it that way now when they
have<00:03:22.960> recon<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.680> don't<00:03:23.860> have<00:03:23.950> camo<00:03:24.280> just

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
have recon and you don't have camo just

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.030 
have recon and you don't have camo just
keep<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.420> move<00:03:25.710> that's<00:03:26.710> what<00:03:26.860> we're<00:03:27.010> doing

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
keep on the move that's what we're doing

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.860 
keep on the move that's what we're doing
here<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:30.280> radar<00:03:30.610> blips<00:03:30.940> every<00:03:31.570> four

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
here because the radar blips every four

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.690 
here because the radar blips every four
seconds<00:03:32.290> or<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.800> you<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:33.100> cover<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.520> lot<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
seconds or so and you can cover a lot of

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.630 
seconds or so and you can cover a lot of
ground<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.570> seconds<00:03:35.050> so<00:03:35.980> by<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.220> time<00:03:36.460> they

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
ground for seconds so by the time they

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.370 
ground for seconds so by the time they
get<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.790> your<00:03:36.970> blip<00:03:37.240> you're<00:03:37.540> long<00:03:37.780> gone<00:03:37.810> and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
get to your blip you're long gone and

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.100 
get to your blip you're long gone and
can<00:03:39.220> possibly<00:03:39.370> even<00:03:39.790> flank<00:03:40.150> them<00:03:40.330> so<00:03:40.810> that's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
can possibly even flank them so that's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.950 
can possibly even flank them so that's
why<00:03:41.290> we're<00:03:42.060> we're<00:03:43.060> trying<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.480> just<00:03:43.810> move

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
why we're we're trying to just move

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.220 
why we're we're trying to just move
around<00:03:44.260> here<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.300> they<00:03:46.420> can't<00:03:46.630> get<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> fix<00:03:47.020> on

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
around here so they can't get a fix on

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.260 
around here so they can't get a fix on
us<00:03:50.250> okay<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.310> we're<00:03:51.550> going<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.730> go<00:03:51.820> towards<00:03:52.090> a
