sticking<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> blend<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.440> with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> mango

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
sticking up and blend it with the mango

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.800 
sticking up and blend it with the mango
to<00:02:11.900> make<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.730> sauce<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.970> pro<00:02:14.090> cut<00:02:14.300> salary<00:02:14.599> with

I'd<00:02:21.140> probably<00:02:22.360> peel<00:02:23.360> them<00:02:23.720> over<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.530> over

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I'd probably peel them over and over

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.320 
I'd probably peel them over and over
again<00:02:24.769> with<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.129> peeler<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.610> make<00:02:25.760> Fettuccine

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
again with a peeler to make Fettuccine

again with a peeler to make Fettuccine
strips<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> pasta<00:02:27.470> or<00:02:28.000> spiralize<00:02:29.000> them

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239

look<00:02:54.530> at<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.450> seriously<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:56.810> such<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
look at that and seriously it is such a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
beautiful and this is a tree that I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.180 
beautiful and this is a tree that I
haven't<00:03:02.150> really<00:03:02.420> attacked<00:03:02.870> yet<00:03:03.079> but<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.739> have

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
haven't really attacked yet but I have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.870 
haven't really attacked yet but I have
one<00:03:04.340> over<00:03:04.610> here<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.599> been<00:03:05.810> attacking

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
one over here that I have been attacking

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.750 
one over here that I have been attacking
and<00:03:07.880> as<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.329> can<00:03:08.450> see<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:08.840> rather<00:03:09.019> sparse

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
and as you can see it's rather sparse

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.740 
and as you can see it's rather sparse
because<00:03:10.760> yeah<00:03:11.630> like<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.230> love<00:03:12.440> my<00:03:12.590> greens<00:03:12.860> and

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
because yeah like I love my greens and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.180 
because yeah like I love my greens and
these<00:03:14.750> screens<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.530> are<00:03:15.620> like<00:03:15.739> one<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.040> my

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
these screens that are like one of my

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.890 
these screens that are like one of my
favorites<00:03:16.639> so<00:03:16.730> didn't<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> chance

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
favorites so didn't have a chance

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.259 
favorites so didn't have a chance
against<00:03:18.230> me<00:03:18.400> anyway<00:03:19.400> that's<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:20.150> I'm

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
against me anyway that's what I'm

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.449 
against me anyway that's what I'm
putting<00:03:20.450> my<00:03:20.540> salad<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.139> that<00:03:21.799> salad<00:03:22.220> would

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
putting my salad and that salad would

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.910 
putting my salad and that salad would
probably<00:03:23.000> have<00:03:24.220> about<00:03:26.019> 650<00:03:27.019> calories<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.769> so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
probably have about 650 calories or so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.090 
probably have about 650 calories or so
in<00:03:28.069> it<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.940> that's<00:03:29.260> probably<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.500> only<00:03:30.680> meal

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
in it and that's probably the only meal

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.160 
in it and that's probably the only meal
that<00:03:31.370> I'd<00:03:31.519> have<00:03:31.819> that's<00:03:32.060> not<00:03:32.180> mono<00:03:32.510> as<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.019> can

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
that I'd have that's not mono as you can

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.910 
that I'd have that's not mono as you can
see<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.470> monos<00:03:33.769> one<00:03:34.100> fruit<00:03:34.430> at<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.670> time<00:03:35.920> there

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
see in monos one fruit at a time there

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.309 
see in monos one fruit at a time there
we<00:03:37.040> go

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
we go

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.030 
we go
so<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:41.450> reason<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.810> have<00:03:42.049> mono<00:03:42.380> meals<00:03:42.829> is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
so the reason I have mono meals is

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.210 
so the reason I have mono meals is
because<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.579> easiest<00:03:43.970> on<00:03:44.209> digestion<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.220> it

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
because it's easiest on digestion and it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.690 
because it's easiest on digestion and it
allows<00:03:46.489> energy<00:03:46.850> you<00:03:47.750> know<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.139> us<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.410> do<00:03:48.700> all

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
allows energy you know for us to do all

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.099 
allows energy you know for us to do all
the<00:03:49.880> other<00:03:49.910> things<00:03:50.239> we<00:03:50.389> want<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.630> do<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:51.019> the

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
the other things we want to do in the

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.610 
the other things we want to do in the
day<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.950> know<00:03:52.010> be<00:03:52.459> an<00:03:52.549> athlete<00:03:53.000> or<00:03:53.329> work<00:03:54.079> or

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
day you know be an athlete or work or

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.129 
day you know be an athlete or work or
play<00:03:54.829> or<00:03:54.859> whatever<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.790> have<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:55.940> do<00:03:56.180> so

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
play or whatever you have to do so

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.990 
play or whatever you have to do so
ease<00:03:57.859> on<00:03:57.889> digestion<00:03:58.549> is<00:03:58.970> really<00:03:59.359> important<00:04:01.000> in

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
ease on digestion is really important in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.180 
ease on digestion is really important in
the<00:04:02.450> whole<00:04:02.540> day<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:02.840> think<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.920> probably

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
the whole day I think that it's probably

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.759 
the whole day I think that it's probably
about<00:04:04.400> 3000<00:04:05.389> calories<00:04:05.599> or<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.019> like<00:04:06.650> that's

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
about 3000 calories or so like that's

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.879 
about 3000 calories or so like that's
what<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> average<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:09.410> looks<00:04:09.590> like<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.769> lot

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
what I average and it looks like a lot

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.830 
what I average and it looks like a lot
of<00:04:09.919> food<00:04:10.160> but<00:04:10.220> really<00:04:10.880> there's<00:04:11.180> not<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:11.660> lot<00:04:11.810> of

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
of food but really there's not a lot of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.659 
of food but really there's not a lot of
calories<00:04:12.049> there<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:13.099> know<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.310> can<00:04:13.459> pair

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669
