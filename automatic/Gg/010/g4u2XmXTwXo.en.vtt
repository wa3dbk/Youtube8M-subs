 Bus driver a video PÃ´le emploi 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 [Voiceover: Attention! Enjoy, these images are rare. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Karima is part of the small 10% of female bus drivers.] 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Karima [bus driver]: 415 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 I enter the number of the line. I adjust the mirror. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 My parents were proud when I told them that I wanted to pass my transit permit. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 My mother was very happy. My father even more, because he's a former bus driver. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 once I got my license, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 it was great joy. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It's true that my childhood dream of a little girl was to have a SUV. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Interviewer: But rest assured, you do not do 4x4? Karima: no! 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 No, we can not ! They are very fragile anyway. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Interviewer: What do you like about your job? 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Karima: Already driving, and then maybe the relationship, to see people, 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 how people react to this or that situation. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Most people who go up do not always say hello to me. They do not even look at you. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And when they want a ticket, most of the time, they ask you the piece. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 There is no "please", there is nothing. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 On the other hand I had small reflections by young people: "Ah, it's a woman who drives a big thing like that, 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 she gets there, "yet they see me very tiny perhaps. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 At one time, buses were not at all like that. It was not automatic 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 we had a gear lever and there was no power steering, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 so you had to have big arms to turn these wheels. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 I have never had a physical aggression. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Insults, yes. Personally it does not reach me. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It may be happening to me, I have not finished my career, 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 but I can not believe that it happens like that for free. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 It's fair, just. But it goes on anyway. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 I do not have anyone behind me. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 My boss is not here, I do not have a manager and I drive. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Interviewer: Yes and you have a responsibility? 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Karima: Oh yes, absolutely. A big responsibility, all those lives in our hands! 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Interviewer: And how is it a beautiful job? Karima: We are very independent, I feel autonomous. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 I am a master on board. It's my home and it's me who welcomes people to my place. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Of all the trades I've been able to do, it's the only one in which I feel in my element. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.733
 [Voice-off: There is no need to say, with Karima we travel serene and we roll safely ...]
