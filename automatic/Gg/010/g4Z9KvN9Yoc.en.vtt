00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.500 
upwards motion just make like you know
lines<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.400> tree<00:01:08.670> you'll<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.000> give<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> kind

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
lines the tree you'll just give it kind

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
lines the tree you'll just give it kind
of<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> effect<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.210> gonna
