00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 and so guys we did i did a review on 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:18.930
 werewolf now I'll show you the most 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:21.140
 lord of the vampire turn into lord 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.140
 vampires 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.860
 That's how it looks when I'm in for Rail 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.140
 vampire lord 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.810
 you can only play in third person 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 he has basically two modes 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.010
 here is such a mini flight to and mode 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.770
 walk in mode at least he can just 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.040
 claws like a werewolf cut in mode 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 flight in the early stages at levels 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.900
 he has two spells 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:04.440
 sucking life with your right hand and 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.440
 raising the dead in the left hand 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.750
 He moves of course faster than 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.290
 simple man do not know or faster than 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 a horse but in this respect a werewolf of course 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.840
 moves faster 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:30.760
 so and also the vampire lord has such 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:35.950
 stella as a vampire's vision that is 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:40.120
 at night he sees the impression that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.540
 Now is the day and there is such as flying 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.540
 mouse and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 that is, such a small teleportation 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:59.000
 lord of vampires, too, can have rock 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:03.740
 they will be such a branch of skills to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.740
 gain skills for the vampire lord 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.929
 here we are killed 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 need to kill enemies 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.700
 either here are such a skill or when 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.450
 clawed need to happen 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.329
 fatality 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.160
 but it happens very rarely let's 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:29.690
 try to raise it now show and 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:34.410
 he will fight on our side 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.230
 so farther for the vampire lord you also don't 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.069
 you can take anything in hand that is 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.129
 weapon 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.870
 armor you can only use here 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:50.099
 these skills that you have in your hands when you 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.819
 you will develop a vampire lord with you 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:03:00.840
 will appear additional 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:02.940
 abilities and abilities like this 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.099
 also be good 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.480
 elementary levels 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:12.900
 so I can not show you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:18.599
 sorry here we are a little bit and chopped off 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.940
 we killed three enemies see see 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.940
 lord vampire was pumped in half 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.940
 folds now show what he fights 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.950
 Now we will find giants if we have them 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.950
 still here is a giant 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.600
 as you see we swing a little bit 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:46.160
 there was one ability we get 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:50.640
 throat pilots well, as if of course 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.880
 more interesting game will be for lord 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.290
 vampires but the vampire lord has 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.260
 some difficulties first see 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.940
 what will happen in the sun now 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.940
 wait a bit until sunrise 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.390
 your vampire blood is boiling in the sun 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:27.410
 like this but this is if you play with cheat 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.060
 tgm it doesn't affect anything but if you 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.420
 play without shields 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:38.240
 then you will not recover not 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.650
 magic is not of course health and not stock 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.730
 strength and 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.190
 It will supply by a few health and strength 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.420
 decrease 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:55.280
 but it is also treated if you are interested 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:58.490
 play at night it is good and so 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.630
 vampire lord still have such a garbage 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:06.560
 which he needs to eat if you donâ€™t 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.370
 eat his strength grows but it is not always 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.350
 OK 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.900
 everyone will attack you 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.260
 to run away from you so this will 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:22.520
 a little under the bother to eat 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:25.820
 man need to find a sleeping person in 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.120
 tent or in the house is not important to go to 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.270
 him and you as you push inspect 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.050
 you will be written to eat just 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:39.950
 come and eat this person 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.530
 there is it is not very difficult 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.750
 all that I also wanted to show and lordi 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.410
 vampires 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:51.320
 let's summarize now of course 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:54.650
 if you don't want to bother then 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.340
 have it play at night or constantly 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.550
 eat then you better choose a werewolf 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.410
 but if you want 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:07.040
 exciting were interesting and 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:14.510
 varied games of course for you 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:16.490
 lord vampire what else should I say but 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.270
 seems to have told everything about these two 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.820
 heroes also if you would be interested you 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.249
 You can read on the Internet how to become 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.669
 hybrid and then 8 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:34.989
 they become the vampire lord and 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:39.099
 a werewolf but this is what you want 

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:43.789
 personally my opinion lord vampire much 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:47.139
 more interesting than a werewolf and i want to play 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:50.809
 for him and also for a werewolf you can 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:55.519
 play only two o'clock lord mappers you 

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:58.159
 can become infinite and while you 

00:07:55.519 --> 00:08:04.539
 do not press the restoration of the appearance he 

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:11.179
 will you have in your usual look well 

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:16.299
 that's how I would like to show all 

00:08:11.179 --> 00:08:16.299
 thank you all for watching
