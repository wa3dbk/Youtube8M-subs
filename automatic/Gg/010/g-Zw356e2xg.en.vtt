 hello skits and shoes 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.750
 your coach in natural health solutions 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.670
 in today's video I'm going 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 answer the question of martin who told me 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 asked his question on my facebook wall 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.750
 on which I invite you to come 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.790
 a lap 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 so this is my nature's glass page 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.400
 on facebook on which we share a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 a lot of things will discuss ecology 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.519
 health etc 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.529
 so I invite you to come and make a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.830
 turn there is register click on the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 page 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 by clicking I like here the question of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.719
 martine do you think of the use of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.700
 liquid paraffin in cosmetics 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 body creams for guys 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:44.250
 cosmetics is a big and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.899
 vast subject I just want to started in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.050
 saying that paraffin is going to give the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 tone of the rest of the videos paraffin 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 ranked on all lists 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 reds in cosmetology the cosmetics that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 under the houses 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.230
 ok it's really a product weight 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 natural ecological skin and especially not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.080
 good for our health 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 despite the fact that it leaves the skin 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.070
 sweet etc so I'll start in 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 saying what exactly is the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.450
 paraffin it's paraffin plate is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 manufactured therefrom and mineral 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.850
 this mineral oil 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.479
 this is a residue refining hockey 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 petrol 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.119
 leaving then it's completely 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 mineral is not at all organic cvo 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.799
 alive then lacked why this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 we probably use that first 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.250
 these residues there we know we did not know 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 too much to start with and we 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 discovered a one use 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.130
 any cosmetics but that's 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.270
 especially because it costs nothing to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.340
 actually produce 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
 understand then it's your envy 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.189
 always about that in cosmetics that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.899
 put ingredients that cost 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.750
 so cheap but who are 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.479
 so poorly performing that looks 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.829
 but who do not have luck we recreate 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 then bessat softens the skin it's 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.340
 mom the property for which one 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.520
 uses years 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.479
 large scale cosmetics 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.859
 now the problems that that same 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.390
 must know that our organization is 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:11.090
 absolutely unable to nick 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.299
 metabolize deals and in good French 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.010
 with its hydrocarbons there okay because 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.480
 that it's still hydrocarbons 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.060
 it is sure that the high level of cosmetics 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.310
 it was a refined and refined film 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.019
 refined several times but it remains 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.319
 no less than they are hydrocarbons 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.880
 hockey then it totally covers this 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.519
 which makes it soft and supple 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.290
 that it smiles the skin of a film ok 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.790
 watertight 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.799
 which in itself is not good I do not stop 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.060
 to speak brushed his skin so that they 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 breathe it transpires that they 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.959
 live like that that's all the 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.590
 otherwise ok the skin is soft of a 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.190
 other way it's done but the skin of 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.390
 breathe more ok his defeat totally the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.849
 ph of the skin 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.680
 ok skin it is a little acid 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.440
 which protects us against bacteria 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.090
 and ambient microbes 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.549
 it's a protective barrier the skin 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.920
 - it's our biggest organ 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.810
 common protector then is these 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.950
 hydrocarbons at natala do we them 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.569
 mineral oils its defeat ph the in 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.680
 the ph of the skin and facts what is it 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.500
 that we can develop reviews of 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.780
 dermatoses and also fungi the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.069
 mushrooms on the skin then the ph of 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.919
 the skin is extremely important to 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.569
 maintain balance okay that 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.430
 prevents the skin from breathing its mouth 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.959
 the pores in the mouth the pores of pau 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.470
 what do we often do points 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.989
 blacks because the right can not go out 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.530
 safed and cne that's also makes 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.530
 buttons etc 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.870
 now I'm going to still have a 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.310
 carcinogenic potential prove the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.290
 hydrocarbons agreement at the level of the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.120
 skin should be aware that the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.880
 hydrocarbons as often driven 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.849
 minerals like that when hands in 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.350
 our skin on our skin some 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.120
 quantity that is absorbed 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.160
 the skin must not believe that the skin c 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.810
 is at stake it's not true the proof in 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.090
 is that when we put bands 8 on the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.860
 propaganda of rose hip oil 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.920
 after fifteen minutes it's fabulous 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.290
 times more oil cci madness try the 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.060
 if you do not believe to try oil from 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.520
 rosehip after 15 minutes you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.920
 could nothing on the skin the apoel and not 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.440
 thanks and not only she's not 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.820
 serious she is very sweet and that's 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.810
 really it does a job 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.390
 extraordinary 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.880
 so what lodges want to come or 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.370
 Carcinogenic potential of paraffin or 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.550
 of any other a mineral using that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.290
 this cosmetic doctor is that it 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.730
 accumulates in the hockey organs and one 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.080
 can not get rid of it 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.720
 really extremely difficult to 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.430
 to dislodge these molecules in our body 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.710
 so that's obviously fine 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.780
 accumulate where it will accumulate at 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.780
 liver level the spleen of the ganglia 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.770
 lymphatic etc 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.990
 these below I will leave you the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.600
 document a link to a pdf document 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.380
 who was up about paraffin 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.130
 just want mineral oils 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.330
 the potential danger that it brings us 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.590
 you will understand I do not recommend them 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.050
 at all products that contain the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.520
 paraffin and it's now there are two 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.110
 books that I would like to go to take 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.270
 the library where you wanted to buy 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.200
 if you really care about these two 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.720
 con con luminaries who have released lives 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.730
 absolutely extraordinary and so laurence 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.120
 wittner his cosmetics how to use 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.910
 it is peeling everything where all 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.880
 ingredients in our non-organic cosmetics 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.370
 and she made orange green lists 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.380
 and red it's really fabulous 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.740
 for this to decode what we put on 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.690
 the skin is pretty amazing is 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.640
 heavy and fat a great sincerity 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.770
 steijns who ran away from on their the 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.590
 truth about cosmetics 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.600
 I will conclude with this little sentence 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.050
 that I said for years in my 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.020
 Cosmetology course house of the little ones 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.879
 products to close 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.819
 it is in principle 98% 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.289
 you should not put yourself on the skin 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.530
 that you would not be able 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.919
 to ingest that just summed up their the 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.449
 thing if it's not a natural butter that 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.610
 you would be able to ingest and 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.430
 digest should not put you on the 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.629
 skin understand served to the hands what is it 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.090
 that I often say in my videos 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.229
 feeds if you are not 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.000
 not able to read what she's on 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.009
 the label of good chances are 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.080
 not able to handle the group the year 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.759
 it's the same for the skin for 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.080
 all the cosmetics know them the 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:42.060
 young people from fiv silicas or advertising from 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.729
 extraordinary advertising for the estimate 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.050
 of self for women j you know of 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:50.159
 who I speak I do not even have a friend 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.419
 here anyway but it's women 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.159
 good in their skin who are a little 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.319
 chubby and so on but within 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.729
 apart from that occurs at his 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.020
 depositors know it they do not even have the 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.810
 right of saprissa wind is a 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.879
 detergent could push back it's not good 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.259
 for our costs include and then what 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.110
 we must remember natural products 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.460
 that respects the ph of the skin and there is 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.770
 would have more problem something 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.130
 who really feeds is in and out 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.620
 outside 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.969
 understand then martine I hope you 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.259
 have answered a little bit I think that 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.080
 I went around and I think you have 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.279
 understood what I meant then I 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.590
 invite you to come for a ride on 

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:27.870
 my website vermot nature.com 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.380
 green and like the color of toul
