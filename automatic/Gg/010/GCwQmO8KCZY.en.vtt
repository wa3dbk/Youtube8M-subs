hi<00:00:00.930> Ian<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.380> and<00:00:01.860> today<00:00:02.070> we<00:00:02.340> want<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.610> work<00:00:02.790> on

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hi Ian here and today we want to work on

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.329 
hi Ian here and today we want to work on
chord<00:00:03.330> changes<00:00:03.840> will<00:00:04.529> be<00:00:04.710> working<00:00:05.130> from

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
chord changes will be working from

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.160 
chord changes will be working from
changing<00:00:05.790> back<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.210> forth<00:00:06.450> between<00:00:06.690> two<00:00:07.140> of

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
changing back and forth between two of

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.870 
changing back and forth between two of
the<00:00:07.350> basic<00:00:07.799> seven<00:00:08.099> chords<00:00:08.519> we've<00:00:08.730> been

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the basic seven chords we've been

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.299 
the basic seven chords we've been
looking<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.330> will<00:00:10.170> work<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.920> E<00:00:10.950> minor

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
looking at will work with the E minor

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.390 
looking at will work with the E minor
and<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.660> C<00:00:12.870> chord<00:00:13.110> today

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and the C chord today

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
and the C chord today
now<00:00:14.940> learning<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.389> change<00:00:15.690> chords<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.289> be

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
now learning to change chords can be

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.230 
now learning to change chords can be
frustrating<00:00:16.680> at<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.189> but<00:00:17.670> stick<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
frustrating at first but stick with it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.320 
frustrating at first but stick with it
and<00:00:18.420> you'll<00:00:18.660> definitely<00:00:18.840> reap<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> rewards

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
and you'll definitely reap the rewards

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.850 
and you'll definitely reap the rewards
when<00:00:21.330> learning<00:00:21.509> to<00:00:21.720> change<00:00:22.020> between<00:00:22.410> chords

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
when learning to change between chords

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.800 
when learning to change between chords
it's<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> good<00:00:23.400> practice<00:00:23.579> to<00:00:23.849> learn<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.450> do

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it's a good practice to learn how to do

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's a good practice to learn how to do
that<00:00:25.020> while<00:00:25.590> keeping<00:00:26.039> time<00:00:26.449> why<00:00:27.449> well<00:00:27.960> there's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
that while keeping time why well there's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.679 
that while keeping time why well there's
lots<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.800> reasons<00:00:28.980> most<00:00:29.910> important<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.509> which

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
lots of reasons most important of which

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
lots of reasons most important of which
is<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> guitar<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> rhythm

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
is that the guitar is a rhythm

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
is that the guitar is a rhythm
instrument<00:00:32.519> that<00:00:33.000> means<00:00:33.210> part<00:00:33.449> of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> guitar

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

players job is to help keep time now
I've<00:00:37.110> met<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.379> of<00:00:37.559> guitar<00:00:37.890> players<00:00:38.129> who

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I've met a lot of guitar players who

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.979 
I've met a lot of guitar players who
forget<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.269> it<00:00:39.390> doesn't<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.809> any

play a song when you're not wanting to
keep<00:00:44.339> time<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.559> practice<00:00:46.979> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
keep time so it's a good practice to

things<00:00:50.430> simple<00:00:50.760> we're<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.299> practice

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
things simple we're going to practice

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.719 
things simple we're going to practice
this<00:00:51.900> using<00:00:52.290> for<00:00:52.559> four<00:00:52.860> times<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.519> the

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
this using for four times that's the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.609 
this using for four times that's the
most<00:00:53.850> common<00:00:53.970> time<00:00:54.479> signature<00:00:54.989> used<00:00:55.290> today

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
most common time signature used today

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.530 
most common time signature used today
that<00:00:56.220> means<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.580> there<00:00:56.729> are<00:00:56.760> four<00:00:57.119> beats<00:00:57.390> in

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
that means that there are four beats in

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.270 
that means that there are four beats in
a<00:00:57.629> measure<00:00:57.839> or<00:00:58.140> bar<00:00:58.409> as<00:00:58.650> it's<00:00:59.070> sometimes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
a measure or bar as it's sometimes

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.219 
a measure or bar as it's sometimes
called<00:00:59.549> and<00:01:00.030> each<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.689> those<00:01:00.780> beats<00:01:01.049> will

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
called and each of those beats will

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.100 
called and each of those beats will
count<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.549> quarter<00:01:02.970> note<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.869> there'll<00:01:04.080> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
count as a quarter note so there'll be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
count as a quarter note so there'll be
four<00:01:04.439> quarter<00:01:04.830> notes<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> measure<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:06.150> if

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
four quarter notes in a measure now if

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120 
four quarter notes in a measure now if
we<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.900> those<00:01:07.080> four<00:01:07.439> beats<00:01:07.650> together

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
we put all those four beats together

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.030 
we put all those four beats together
that's<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.360> call<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.900> whole<00:01:10.530> note<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that's what we call a whole note and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.090 
that's what we call a whole note and
that<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.390> whole<00:01:12.630> measure<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that would take up the whole measure so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.060 
that would take up the whole measure so
if<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.369> were<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> play<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> whole<00:01:15.180> note<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:16.070> strum

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
if I were to play a whole note or strum

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
if I were to play a whole note or strum
a<00:01:17.100> whole<00:01:17.610> beat<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.750> guitar<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.500> be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a whole beat on the guitar it would be

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:29.150 
a whole beat on the guitar it would be
one<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:21.560> three<00:01:22.610> four<00:01:24.110> 1234<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.830> be<00:01:28.950> using

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
one two three four 1234 I would be using

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.149 
one two three four 1234 I would be using
the<00:01:29.460> whole<00:01:29.700> measure<00:01:30.380> now<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.440> could<00:01:31.800> break<00:01:32.010> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the whole measure now I could break that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.080 
the whole measure now I could break that
in<00:01:32.370> half<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.140> then<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.190> having<00:01:35.550> using

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
in half and then I would be having using

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.590 
in half and then I would be having using
half<00:01:36.420> notes<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.390> sound

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
half notes and the way that would sound

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.440 
half notes and the way that would sound
then<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:41.010> let's<00:01:41.520> count<00:01:41.730> it<00:01:41.880> through<00:01:45.409> 1234

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
then is this let's count it through 1234

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
then is this let's count it through 1234
1234<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> each<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.409> those<00:01:52.590> strums<00:01:53.130> took<00:01:54.120> up

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
1234 so each one of those strums took up

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.980 
1234 so each one of those strums took up
half<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.560> measure<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.370> were<00:01:56.430> half<00:01:56.670> notes

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
half the measure so they were half notes

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
half the measure so they were half notes
now<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> play<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.880> break

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
now if I go and want to play and break

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
now if I go and want to play and break
that<00:02:00.299> down<00:02:00.479> again<00:02:00.900> we<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> quarter<00:02:02.100> notes

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that down again we have quarter notes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
that down again we have quarter notes
and<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.810> would<00:02:03.930> mean<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.440> every

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and then that would mean that on every

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.010 
and then that would mean that on every
single<00:02:05.130> beat<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.940> measure<00:02:06.240> or<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.720> bar

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
single beat of that measure or that bar

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.800 
single beat of that measure or that bar
I<00:02:07.350> would<00:02:07.830> be<00:02:07.979> strumming<00:02:08.369> down<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.030> playing

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
I would be strumming down and playing

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470 
I would be strumming down and playing
each<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> those<00:02:10.709> quarters<00:02:11.299> so<00:02:12.299> let's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
each one of those quarters so let's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:23.230 
each one of those quarters so let's
count<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.959> again<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:14.610> two<00:02:15.920> three<00:02:16.920> four

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.290 

but<00:02:24.240> now<00:02:24.480> i<00:02:24.840> want<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.440> change<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> sea<00:02:26.300> so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
but now i want to change to the sea so

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.930 
but now i want to change to the sea so
i'll<00:02:27.420> start<00:02:27.690> by<00:02:28.110> star<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> start<00:02:29.520> i'll<00:02:29.700> play

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
i'll start by star so to start i'll play

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.180 
i'll start by star so to start i'll play
a<00:02:29.970> measure<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.420> e<00:02:30.780> minor<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.470> then<00:02:31.920> play<00:02:32.160> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
a measure of e minor and then play a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.690 
a measure of e minor and then play a
measure<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:33.570> I'll<00:02:34.040> slow<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> temple<00:02:35.550> down

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
measure of see I'll slow the temple down

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.780 
measure of see I'll slow the temple down
a<00:02:35.760> bit<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.240> make<00:02:36.420> sure<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.900> easier<00:02:38.090> one<00:02:39.440> two

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
a bit to make sure it's easier one two

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:55.850 
a bit to make sure it's easier one two
three<00:02:42.110> four

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.490 

now<00:02:56.860> learning<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.310> change<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.730> time<00:02:57.970> now<00:02:58.500> we'll

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
now learning to change in time now we'll

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.580 
now learning to change in time now we'll
get<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.830> farther<00:03:00.130> faster<00:03:00.520> if<00:03:01.350> you're<00:03:02.350> finding

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
get you farther faster if you're finding

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.800 
get you farther faster if you're finding
it<00:03:02.770> too<00:03:02.950> hard<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.370> switch<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.819> first<00:03:04.090> then

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it too hard to switch it first then

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.080 
it too hard to switch it first then
still<00:03:05.200> count<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.740> in<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.670> play<00:03:06.910> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
still count it in and the play the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.510 
still count it in and the play the
chords<00:03:07.420> for<00:03:07.540> either<00:03:07.720> half<00:03:08.110> notes<00:03:08.440> or<00:03:08.860> whole

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
chords for either half notes or whole

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.760 
chords for either half notes or whole
notes<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:10.750> will<00:03:10.870> give<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.110> more<00:03:11.319> time<00:03:11.380> to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
notes that will give you more time to

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.580 
notes that will give you more time to
change<00:03:12.340> between<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.970> chords<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.989> reinforce

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
change between the chords but reinforce

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.180 
change between the chords but reinforce
the<00:03:14.860> importance<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.610> keeping<00:03:16.270> time<00:03:16.920> let's<00:03:17.920> try

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
the importance of keeping time let's try

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.720 
the importance of keeping time let's try
it<00:03:18.250> first<00:03:18.550> with<00:03:19.300> just<00:03:19.600> simply<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.050> whole<00:03:20.319> note

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
it first with just simply the whole note

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.809 
it first with just simply the whole note
so<00:03:21.730> i'm<00:03:21.819> going<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.000> count<00:03:22.150> us<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.450> again<00:03:22.680> one

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
so i'm going to count us in again one

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:37.380 
so i'm going to count us in again one
two<00:03:24.819> three<00:03:26.340> four

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.390 

ok<00:03:38.390> now<00:03:38.660> let's<00:03:38.690> try<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.410> with<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.190> half<00:03:40.370> note

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
ok now let's try that with the half note

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.270 
ok now let's try that with the half note
and<00:03:41.060> I'll<00:03:41.570> keep<00:03:41.810> counting<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.440> time<00:03:42.710> even<00:03:42.950> as

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
and I'll keep counting this time even as

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.420 
and I'll keep counting this time even as
I'm<00:03:43.430> playing<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.000> notes<00:03:44.180> or<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> courts<00:03:49.180> 1234

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
I'm playing the notes or the courts 1234

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:02.080 
I'm playing the notes or the courts 1234
1234<00:03:56.080> 1234<00:04:00.430> practice<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.880> you'll<00:04:01.970> go

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
1234 1234 practice that and you'll go

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.280 
1234 1234 practice that and you'll go
far<00:04:02.330> that's<00:04:03.110> all<00:04:03.320> for<00:04:03.530> now<00:04:03.560> Cheers
