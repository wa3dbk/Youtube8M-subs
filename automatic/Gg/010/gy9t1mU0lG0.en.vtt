00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
metal alloy to contract which is going

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.069 
metal alloy to contract which is going
to<00:00:55.140> allow<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> fit<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.129> our<00:00:56.870> receiving<00:00:57.870> hole

to allow it to fit in our receiving hole
a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.530> better<00:00:59.420> there<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.570> several

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
a little better there are several

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.410 
a little better there are several
methods<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.469> pulling<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> stud<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.969> method<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
methods for pulling a stud the method I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.469 
methods for pulling a stud the method I
prefer<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> constant<00:01:05.939> velocity

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
prefer is to use a constant velocity

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
prefer is to use a constant velocity
joint<00:01:06.740> nut<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.250> grab<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lug

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
joint nut just like so and grab a lug

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
joint nut just like so and grab a lug
nut<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:12.090> won't<00:01:12.450> use<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.110> use<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
nut here won't use that little use this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
nut here won't use that little use this
one<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:16.040> we<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> start<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.939> lug

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
one here we are going to start this lug

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.690 
one here we are going to start this lug
nut<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.630> there

right what I like to do is to take my

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.899 
right what I like to do is to take my
little<00:01:49.869> pry<00:01:50.079> bar<00:01:50.350> here<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.399> I'm<00:01:51.490> going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.670> set

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
little pry bar here and I'm going to set

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.230 
little pry bar here and I'm going to set
it<00:01:52.000> between<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:53.380> other<00:01:53.619> good<00:01:53.829> studs<00:01:54.219> as<00:01:54.520> you

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
it between two other good studs as you

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.870 
it between two other good studs as you
can<00:01:55.390> see<00:01:55.600> that's<00:01:55.899> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.259> apply<00:01:56.880> resistance

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
can see that's going to apply resistance

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.029 
can see that's going to apply resistance
for<00:01:58.179> me<00:01:58.329> so<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.659> can<00:01:58.869> go<00:01:58.990> ahead<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.409> fill<00:01:59.740> that

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
for me so I can go ahead and fill that

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
for me so I can go ahead and fill that

the stud through the back we're going to

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.850 
the stud through the back we're going to
pull<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.599> through<00:02:25.630> until<00:02:26.140> it's<00:02:26.349> flat<00:02:26.590> just

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
pull it through until it's flat just

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370 
pull it through until it's flat just
like<00:02:27.099> one<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> these<00:02:27.519> once<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.569> get<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.930> seated

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
like one of these once I get it seated

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.470 
like one of these once I get it seated
I'll<00:02:29.500> rotate<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.190> hub<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.549> show<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.209> what
