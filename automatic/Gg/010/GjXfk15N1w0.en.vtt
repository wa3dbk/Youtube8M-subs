00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
blended in with my skin I believe in the

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.830 
blended in with my skin I believe in the
winter<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:21.610> it's<00:04:21.880> almost<00:04:22.120> winter<00:04:22.330> here

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
winter because it's almost winter here

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
you should always get um kind of a

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.020 
you should always get um kind of a
lighter<00:04:28.120> color<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:30.370> in<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.640> summer<00:04:30.850> you

in this same skin clearing line I didn't
get<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.030> because<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.960> was<00:04:59.050> like<00:04:59.200> eight

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:20.899 

okay<00:05:12.710> okay<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.099> think<00:05:14.930> I'm<00:05:15.930> done<00:05:16.460> um<00:05:19.909> from

okay okay so I think I'm done um from
the<00:05:21.090> looks<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.509> it<00:05:21.569> I<00:05:22.370> don't<00:05:23.370> think<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.849> looks

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
the looks of it I don't think it looks

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.990 
the looks of it I don't think it looks
that<00:05:24.300> bad<00:05:24.530> but<00:05:25.530> I<00:05:25.860> should<00:05:26.220> probably<00:05:26.250> give<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:26.879> a

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
that bad but I should probably give it a

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.999 
that bad but I should probably give it a

but um I figured since I'm like breaking
out<00:06:12.300> horribly<00:06:12.690> right<00:06:12.900> now<00:06:13.050> I'd<00:06:13.319> use<00:06:13.620> this<00:06:13.919> and

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
out horribly right now I'd use this and

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.640 
out horribly right now I'd use this and

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
on that um so I think it's seeped into

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.439 
on that um so I think it's seeped into
my<00:06:22.110> skin<00:06:22.740> enough<00:06:24.020> I'm<00:06:25.020> sweating<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:26.360> think<00:06:27.360> it

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
my skin enough I'm sweating I think it

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.800 
my skin enough I'm sweating I think it
looks<00:06:27.479> pretty<00:06:27.690> good<00:06:27.990> personally<00:06:28.949> um<00:06:29.659> if<00:06:30.659> you

it hurt you guys might not like it
really<00:06:56.909> depends<00:06:57.240> what<00:06:57.330> products<00:06:57.719> you<00:06:57.810> use

really depends what products you use
before<00:06:58.169> it<00:06:58.500> like<00:06:58.710> let's<00:06:59.190> say<00:06:59.310> if<00:06:59.490> I<00:06:59.610> didn't

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
before it like let's say if I didn't

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.760 
before it like let's say if I didn't
have<00:07:00.000> a<00:07:00.060> moisturizer<00:07:00.719> on<00:07:00.930> before<00:07:01.409> this<00:07:01.560> it

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
have a moisturizer on before this it

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.200 
have a moisturizer on before this it
would<00:07:01.889> probably<00:07:02.099> completely<00:07:02.639> dry<00:07:03.000> out<00:07:03.180> my

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
would probably completely dry out my

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.659 
would probably completely dry out my
skin<00:07:03.330> and<00:07:03.719> make<00:07:03.870> it<00:07:03.990> look<00:07:04.110> horrible<00:07:04.560> but<00:07:04.740> I<00:07:05.490> put

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
skin and make it look horrible but I put

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.999 
skin and make it look horrible but I put
on<00:07:05.789> a<00:07:05.819> moisturizer<00:07:06.479> before<00:07:06.690> this<00:07:07.139> I

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
on a moisturizer before this I

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.740 
on a moisturizer before this I
definitely<00:07:08.610> wash<00:07:08.879> my<00:07:09.090> face<00:07:09.240> before<00:07:09.509> this

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
definitely wash my face before this

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.900 
definitely wash my face before this
considering<00:07:10.319> the<00:07:10.409> fact<00:07:10.590> that<00:07:10.710> I

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
considering the fact that I

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.150 
considering the fact that I

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
in the shower so it really all depends

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.390 
in the shower so it really all depends
on<00:07:13.460> how<00:07:13.640> your<00:07:13.850> skin<00:07:14.180> is<00:07:14.330> so<00:07:15.050> I<00:07:15.080> like<00:07:15.650> it<00:07:15.890> again
