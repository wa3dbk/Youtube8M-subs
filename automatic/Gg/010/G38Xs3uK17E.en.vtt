00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
and to show you how the camera worked

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.960 
and to show you how the camera worked
when<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.780> was<00:03:45.870> walking<00:03:46.350> across<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.970> walkway

when I was walking across this walkway

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.630 
when I was walking across this walkway
the<00:03:48.959> camera<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.350> pretty<00:03:49.560> pretty<00:03:50.010> stable<00:03:50.340> but

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
the camera is pretty pretty stable but

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.180 
the camera is pretty pretty stable but
you<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.120> hold<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.380> learn<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.620> hold<00:03:52.920> it

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
is this kind of tricky

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.759 
is this kind of tricky
in<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> moment<00:03:55.860> we'll<00:03:55.950> go<00:03:56.100> inside<00:03:56.489> there<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.940> the
