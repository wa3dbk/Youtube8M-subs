 we find in San Rafael the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.529
 protected in Valencia we find ourselves in 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.540
 the pomegranate eyes workshop in the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.040
 now lanterns by means of material 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.190
 verifiable as are the milk boxes 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.719
 you can see how the minutes are prepared 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.980
 organizer for September 15 in 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.980
 his workshop here in his house 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.000
 we can see one of the centers is only 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.720
 using the newspaper also newspaper 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 to recycle 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:42.370
 explains we are rolling up the newspaper 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.300
 which we work to decorate this the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.330
 lanterns 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.220
 this is a technique that is used with 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.030
 gum and 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.670
 but echo rolled in this way for 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.380
 that so that in a conical way to 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.810
 So this is what I said 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.239
 decorate the lanterns that a mold that 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:08.020
 we do with a casting with 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.510
 with cardboards also with this same what 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.340
 we decorate 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 You can also show us one of the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 values ​​that have already been developed for the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 People listen if fails 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.830
 they can see how this has made the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.830
 bluffs yes clear 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.509
 as we know that we are in a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.229
 in time of independence then 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.670
 We are working your cart lanterns 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:41.140
 typical also these others that are in 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 process that are this casitas 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.040
 we also have things more more like a 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.780
 little bit more truths of this 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.010
 finer maybe not 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.430
 this bluff 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.310
 this is like an exclusivity 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.020
 to inform the car we can 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.250
 explain how long this laborer has lasted 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.250

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.430
 as to adored being you 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.290
