00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
another video in this video we are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.130 
another video in this video we are
looking<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.970> circle<00:00:27.390> theorem<00:00:27.599> listen<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
looking at the circle theorem listen to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.740 
looking at the circle theorem listen to
we're<00:00:31.140> looking<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.380> another<00:00:31.470> theorem<00:00:31.980> here

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
we're looking at another theorem here

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.750 
we're looking at another theorem here
it's<00:00:33.750> called<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.020> cyclic<00:00:34.500> quadrilateral

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.660 

pretty<00:00:38.760> much<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.520> well

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pretty much what is it here is that well

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.350 
pretty much what is it here is that well
we<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.960> quadrilateral<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we have a quadrilateral that is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.779 
we have a quadrilateral that is
inscribed<00:00:45.989> into<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.710> circle<00:00:48.050> okay<00:00:49.250> now<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
inscribed into a circle okay now what is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
inscribed into a circle okay now what is
important<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> very<00:00:52.199> very

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
important here which is very very

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.779 
important here which is very very
important<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.809> recognize<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.789> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
important to recognize that the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.610 
important to recognize that the
quadrilateral<00:00:58.579> has<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.359> vertex<00:01:00.899> at

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
quadrilateral has to have the vertex at

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.100 
quadrilateral has to have the vertex at
its<00:01:03.799> circumference<00:01:05.299> added<00:01:06.299> circumference<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
its circumference added circumference of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.730 
its circumference added circumference of
the<00:01:07.229> circle<00:01:08.659> okay<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the circle okay so this is a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
the circle okay so this is a
quadrilateral<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.580> has<00:01:11.729> four<00:01:12.000> sides<00:01:12.590> right

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
quadrilateral it has four sides right

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
quadrilateral it has four sides right
and<00:01:14.330> here<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> vertex<00:01:16.490> vertex<00:01:17.490> one

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and here we have the vertex vertex one

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.480 
and here we have the vertex vertex one
two<00:01:18.330> three<00:01:18.930> four<00:01:19.320> times<00:01:19.560> four<00:01:20.040> vertices

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
two three four times four vertices

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.020 
two three four times four vertices
vertices<00:01:21.619> right<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.220> theorem<00:01:26.520> pretty

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
vertices right now this theorem pretty

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.160 
vertices right now this theorem pretty
much<00:01:27.240> says<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.840> opposite<00:01:28.470> angles<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
much says that opposite angles the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.200 
much says that opposite angles the
opposite<00:01:31.710> angles<00:01:32.250> adds<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> 180<00:01:33.840> degrees

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
opposite angles adds up to 180 degrees

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.719 
opposite angles adds up to 180 degrees
okay<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.409> angle<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.040> say<00:01:39.049> 40<00:01:40.049> degrees

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
okay so if this angle is say 40 degrees

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
okay so if this angle is say 40 degrees
then<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.000> angle<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:44.990> 140<00:01:45.990> degrees<00:01:46.350> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
then this angle has to be 140 degrees so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.630 
then this angle has to be 140 degrees so
if<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.460> unclear<00:01:48.530> say<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> angle<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.189> 40

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
if this unclear say this angle is 40

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.270 
if this unclear say this angle is 40
degrees<00:01:52.070> right<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.880> angle<00:01:54.240> would<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
degrees right then this angle would be

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.270 
degrees right then this angle would be
140<00:01:56.280> degrees<00:01:56.990> because<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.140> 4<00:01:58.380> degrees<00:01:58.799> plus

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
140 degrees because of 4 degrees plus

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.300 
140 degrees because of 4 degrees plus
104<00:02:00.060> degrees<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.439> hundred<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.100> eight

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
104 degrees is a hundred and eight

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
104 degrees is a hundred and eight
degrees<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.180> opposite<00:02:03.780> angles<00:02:04.380> are<00:02:05.780> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
degrees the opposite angles are a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
degrees the opposite angles are a
hundred<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.979> eighty<00:02:08.160> degrees<00:02:08.580> likewise<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
hundred and eighty degrees likewise in

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
hundred and eighty degrees likewise in
this<00:02:09.929> idea<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.830> example<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.489> say<00:02:11.760> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
this idea so for example if I say this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.580 
this idea so for example if I say this
angle<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.370 

seventy-five<00:02:16.590> degrees<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.140> find

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
seventy-five degrees and I have to find

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.150 
seventy-five degrees and I have to find
this<00:02:19.650> angle<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.310> let's<00:02:20.490> call<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.760> angle<00:02:21.060> X

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
this angle so let's call this angle X

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.660 
this angle so let's call this angle X
right<00:02:23.160> now<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.360> angle<00:02:24.660> X<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.250> been

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.040 

sent<00:02:29.870> 180<00:02:30.870> degrees<00:02:31.290> minus<00:02:31.950> 75<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.810> it'd<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.930> a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
sent 180 degrees minus 75 so it'd be a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.920 
sent 180 degrees minus 75 so it'd be a
hundred<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.710> five<00:02:35.180> degrees<00:02:37.370> okay<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
hundred and five degrees okay so the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.610 
hundred and five degrees okay so the
opposite<00:02:40.530> angles<00:02:41.510> adds<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.930> hundred<00:02:43.410> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
opposite angles adds up to a hundred and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
opposite angles adds up to a hundred and
eighty<00:02:44.280> degrees<00:02:45.170> right<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.650> again<00:02:47.340> what

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
eighty degrees right now what again what

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.970 
eighty degrees right now what again what
is<00:02:47.730> very<00:02:48.090> very<00:02:48.360> important<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
is very very important here is that the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
is very very important here is that the
four<00:02:50.820> vertex<00:02:52.430> has<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.880> at<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> circumference

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
four vertex has to be at a circumference

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.199 
four vertex has to be at a circumference
of<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.110> circle<00:02:55.320> for<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> quantify<00:02:56.760> has<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
of the circle for it to quantify has a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
of the circle for it to quantify has a
cyclic<00:02:57.930> quadrilateral<00:02:58.220> inscribe<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
cyclic quadrilateral inscribe in a

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.810 
cyclic quadrilateral inscribe in a
circle<00:03:00.020> right<00:03:01.020> because<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.280> actually

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
circle right because you can actually

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.710 
circle right because you can actually
draw<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:06.260> quadrilateral<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.740> not<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> circle

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
draw a quadrilateral it's not a circle

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.780 
draw a quadrilateral it's not a circle
but<00:03:09.720> if<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.200> four<00:03:10.470> vertices<00:03:10.830> doesn't<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
but if the four vertices doesn't have to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.160 
but if the four vertices doesn't have to
be<00:03:11.970> at<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.530> circumference<00:03:14.600> now<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.840> will<00:03:15.990> not

let's<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.360> quick<00:03:27.870> sketch<00:03:28.140> there's<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.950> quick

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
let's do a quick sketch there's a quick

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.870 
let's do a quick sketch there's a quick
arms<00:03:29.959> sketch<00:03:30.959> here<00:03:31.230> say<00:03:31.980> let<00:03:32.130> have<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> circular

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
arms sketch here say let have a circular

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.630 
arms sketch here say let have a circular
for<00:03:33.150> example<00:03:33.600> okay<00:03:34.560> obviously<00:03:35.070> that's<00:03:35.580> not

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
for example okay obviously that's not

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.300 
for example okay obviously that's not
drawn<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.000> scale<00:03:36.470> then<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> could<00:03:37.769> have<00:03:37.980> said

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
drawn to scale then I could have said

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.790 
drawn to scale then I could have said
yeah<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:41.790> line<00:03:42.000> there<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:44.220> land<00:03:44.580> there<00:03:47.030> there

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
yeah one line there on land there there

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.790 
yeah one line there on land there there
so<00:03:49.800> here<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.209> circle<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.050> have<00:03:52.080> a

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
so here I have a circle I have a

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.560 
so here I have a circle I have a
quadrilateral<00:03:53.340> inside<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> circle<00:03:54.540> okay<00:03:55.550> now

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
quadrilateral inside a circle okay now

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.479 
quadrilateral inside a circle okay now
notice<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:59.660> one<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.930> vertex<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.709> this

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
notice that one of the vertex of this

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.170 
notice that one of the vertex of this
quadrilateral<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:04.530> not<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
quadrilateral is not on the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.000 
quadrilateral is not on the
circumference<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:07.730> this<00:04:08.730> circle<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.390> this

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
circumference of this circle so this

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.250 
circumference of this circle so this
this<00:04:11.010> quadrilateral<00:04:11.459> here<00:04:14.000> here<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.720> vertex

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
this quadrilateral here here this vertex

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.120 
this quadrilateral here here this vertex
here

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
here

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.070 
here
is<00:04:18.190> not<00:04:18.550> on<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.120> circumference<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
is not on the circumference of the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.200 
is not on the circumference of the
circle<00:04:21.000> okay

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
circle okay

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.860 
circle okay
so<00:04:22.720> therefore<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:24.190> would<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.580> qualify<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:25.420> a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so therefore this would not qualify as a

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.010 
so therefore this would not qualify as a
cyclic<00:04:26.800> quadrilateral<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:28.650> will<00:04:29.650> satisfy

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
cyclic quadrilateral that will satisfy

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.830 
cyclic quadrilateral that will satisfy
the<00:04:32.040> theorem<00:04:33.040> where<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.850> opposite<00:04:34.300> angles

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the theorem where the opposite angles

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.270 
the theorem where the opposite angles
are<00:04:35.130> 180<00:04:36.130> degrees<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.150> is<00:04:37.300> not<00:04:37.450> qualified

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
are 180 degrees so this is not qualified

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
are 180 degrees so this is not qualified
okay

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
okay

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.210 
okay
the<00:04:40.870> quadrilateral<00:04:43.020> vertices<00:04:44.020> has<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.830> be<00:04:44.980> all

the quadrilateral vertices has to be all

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.790 
the quadrilateral vertices has to be all
four<00:04:46.020> vertices<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.940> quadrilateral<00:04:49.800> must

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
for it to satisfy this theorem okay so

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.360 
for it to satisfy this theorem okay so
again<00:04:59.320> all<00:04:59.530> the<00:05:00.220> four<00:05:00.520> vertices<00:05:02.070> vertex<00:05:03.070> one

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
not satisfy that terror okay so in order

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.410 
not satisfy that terror okay so in order
for<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.610> theorem<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:41.740> know<00:05:41.890> for<00:05:42.160> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.890 
quadrilateral as its inscribed inside
the<00:05:44.650> circle<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.910> satisfy<00:05:46.390> the<00:05:46.450> terror<00:05:46.810> of

the circle to satisfy the terror of
where<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.410> opposite<00:05:47.860> angles<00:05:48.810> must<00:05:49.810> hide<00:05:50.140> up

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
where the opposite angles must hide up

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.680 
where the opposite angles must hide up
to<00:05:50.410> 180<00:05:51.010> degrees<00:05:52.110> right<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.890> four<00:05:54.250> vertices

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
to 180 degrees right the four vertices

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.230 
to 180 degrees right the four vertices
must<00:05:55.690> be<00:05:56.110> on<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.470> circumference<00:05:57.040> so<00:05:58.030> in<00:05:58.090> this

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
must be on the circumference so in this

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.120 
must be on the circumference so in this
example<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:58.930> die<00:05:59.700> that<00:06:00.700> I<00:06:00.850> am<00:06:01.090> have<00:06:01.450> here<00:06:02.130> you

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
example that die that I am have here you

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.580 
example that die that I am have here you
can<00:06:03.280> see<00:06:03.460> that<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.670> four<00:06:04.180> vertices<00:06:04.600> vertex

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
can see that the four vertices vertex

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.820 
can see that the four vertices vertex
one<00:06:06.130> two<00:06:06.790> three<00:06:07.330> four<00:06:07.750> is<00:06:08.380> on<00:06:08.590> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
one two three four is on the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.400 
one two three four is on the
circumference<00:06:09.430> of<00:06:09.700> the<00:06:09.820> circle

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
circumference of the circle

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.400 
circumference of the circle
therefore<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:12.460> opposite<00:06:13.060> angles<00:06:13.630> hides<00:06:14.140> up

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
therefore the opposite angles hides up

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.120 
therefore the opposite angles hides up
to<00:06:14.590> 180<00:06:15.460> degrees<00:06:16.080> okay<00:06:17.080> so<00:06:17.140> this<00:06:17.470> angle<00:06:17.740> here

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
to 180 degrees okay so this angle here

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.480 
to 180 degrees okay so this angle here
is<00:06:18.820> 40<00:06:19.600> degrees<00:06:19.960> then<00:06:20.560> this<00:06:20.800> angle<00:06:20.860> obviously

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
is 40 degrees then this angle obviously

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.190 
is 40 degrees then this angle obviously
is<00:06:22.360> 140<00:06:23.170> degrees<00:06:23.530> at<00:06:24.010> Heights<00:06:24.340> up<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.640> 180<00:06:25.300> this

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
is 140 degrees at Heights up to 180 this

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.830 
is 140 degrees at Heights up to 180 this
angle<00:06:26.650> centerfire<00:06:27.190> degrees<00:06:27.610> and<00:06:27.940> obviously

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
angle centerfire degrees and obviously

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
angle centerfire degrees and obviously
this<00:06:29.590> handle<00:06:30.010> here

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
this handle here

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.760 
this handle here
be<00:06:31.099> a<00:06:31.400> hundred<00:06:31.969> and<00:06:32.090> five<00:06:32.300> degrees<00:06:32.509> on<00:06:33.110> general

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
be a hundred and five degrees on general

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.279 
be a hundred and five degrees on general
five<00:06:33.979> degrees<00:06:34.370> plus<00:06:34.759> Center<00:06:35.719> five<00:06:35.900> degrees

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
five degrees plus Center five degrees

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.649 
five degrees plus Center five degrees
equals<00:06:37.159> the<00:06:37.310> 180<00:06:38.030> degrees

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
equals the 180 degrees

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.309 
equals the 180 degrees
okay<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:40.310> sometimes<00:06:40.879> a<00:06:41.120> trick<00:06:41.389> a<00:06:41.659> trick

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
okay so sometimes a trick a trick

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.409 
okay so sometimes a trick a trick
question<00:06:42.500> can<00:06:43.009> be<00:06:43.039> the<00:06:43.759> jaw<00:06:44.120> our

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
question can be the jaw our

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.350 
question can be the jaw our
quadrilateral<00:06:45.319> inside<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.650> circle<00:06:46.389> right<00:06:48.219> but

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
quadrilateral inside a circle right but

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.670 
quadrilateral inside a circle right but
not<00:06:50.360> all<00:06:50.629> the<00:06:50.780> vertices<00:06:51.080> are<00:06:51.409> on<00:06:51.560> the

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
not all the vertices are on the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.520 
not all the vertices are on the
circumference<00:06:52.189> and<00:06:52.870> you're<00:06:53.870> thinking<00:06:54.139> that

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
circumference and you're thinking that

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.839 
circumference and you're thinking that
the<00:06:54.680> opposite<00:06:55.009> angle<00:06:55.250> is<00:06:55.490> going<00:06:55.610> to<00:06:55.699> be<00:06:55.819> a

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
the opposite angle is going to be a

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.670 
the opposite angle is going to be a
hundred<00:06:56.000> eighty<00:06:56.360> degrees<00:06:56.750> no<00:06:57.080> that's<00:06:57.409> not<00:06:57.590> the

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
hundred eighty degrees no that's not the

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.119 
hundred eighty degrees no that's not the
case

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
case

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.559 
case
okay<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.539> four<00:06:59.840> vertices<00:07:00.229> must<00:07:00.949> be<00:07:01.340> on<00:07:01.580> the

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569 
okay the four vertices must be on the

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.029 
okay the four vertices must be on the
circumference<00:07:03.189> for<00:07:04.189> it<00:07:04.279> to<00:07:04.659> satisfy<00:07:05.659> that

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
circumference for it to satisfy that

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.659 
circumference for it to satisfy that
that<00:07:07.039> theorem<00:07:07.520> okay<00:07:08.449> so<00:07:09.229> that's<00:07:09.800> it<00:07:10.039> pretty

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
that theorem okay so that's it pretty

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.719 
that theorem okay so that's it pretty
much<00:07:10.789> for<00:07:11.689> this<00:07:11.810> video

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729

circle theorem lesson two cyclic

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:19.029 
circle theorem lesson two cyclic
quadrilateral<00:07:16.629> okay<00:07:17.629> and<00:07:17.949> remember<00:07:18.949> the

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 
quadrilateral okay and remember the

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.649 
quadrilateral okay and remember the
opposite<00:07:19.460> angles<00:07:19.969> hides<00:07:20.509> up<00:07:20.719> to<00:07:20.870> 180<00:07:21.469> degrees

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659 
opposite angles hides up to 180 degrees

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:27.700 
opposite angles hides up to 180 degrees
okay<00:07:23.659> and<00:07:24.610> the<00:07:25.610> four<00:07:25.939> vertices<00:07:26.210> must<00:07:27.080> be<00:07:27.469> on

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
okay and the four vertices must be on

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.129 
okay and the four vertices must be on
the<00:07:27.860> circumference<00:07:28.490> of<00:07:28.729> the<00:07:28.849> circle<00:07:29.080> okay<00:07:30.080> so

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139 
the circumference of the circle okay so

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:32.889 
the circumference of the circle okay so
that's<00:07:30.379> it<00:07:30.500> for<00:07:30.620> this<00:07:30.710> video
