AT THE SCENE OF THE HELICOPTER

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.890
CRASH, AND A STORAGE FACILITY

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.930
ABOUT 1/10 OF A MILE SOUTH OF

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.760
WHERE THE AIRPLANE CRASH.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.770
WE DON'T KNOW IF ALL THREE WERE

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.400

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.940
COULD IS POSSIBLE THERE

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.600
COULD'VE BEEN SOMEBODY ON THE

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.170
GROUND AT THE TIME WHEN THE

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.380
HELICOPTER CAME DOWN?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.840
WE CAN'T ASSUME ANYTHING.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510
IT IS TOO EARLY.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.180
INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING RIGHT

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.360

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.600
THE INITIAL INFORMATION FROM

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.330

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.070
THEIR INJURIES WERE NOT SEVERE,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.600
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO ASSUME

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.340
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.770
THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.470

GREG SHIPLEY, THANK YOU FOR

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.650
KEEPING US UP-TO-DATE.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.160
WE DO KNOW FROM SEEING THE TAIL

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.490
NUMBER ON THE PLANE THAT IT IS A

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.230
AIRPLANE -- AN AIRPLANE OWNED BY

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.360
AN AUTO REPAIR BUSINESS, BUT WE

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.730
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE PEOPLE

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.330
INVOLVED IN THAT BUSINESS ARE

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.730
INVOLVED IN THIS CRASH.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.340
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PLANE WAS

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.300
HEADED FROM TENNESSEE TO

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.770

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.370
THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS INVOLVED

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.340
IN A TRAINING EXERCISE.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.540
GREG, YOU CAN'T CONFIRM

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.480
