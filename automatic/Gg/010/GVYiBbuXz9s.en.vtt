00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
very high he most districts in on most
days<00:00:16.619> however<00:00:17.130> there<00:00:17.460> could<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.820> spike<00:00:18.150> day

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
days however there could be a spike day

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630

late<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> week<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.859> will<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.070> Friday<00:00:20.310> so

late in the week which will be Friday so

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
late in the week which will be Friday so
certainly<00:00:21.060> watch<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> same

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
certainly watch that but on the same

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.349 
certainly watch that but on the same
token<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.010> forecast<00:00:23.460> indicator<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.180> may

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
token the forecast indicator there may

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480 
token the forecast indicator there may
be<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.510> shower<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.900> rain<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.260> Friday<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.710> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
be a shower of rain on Friday so it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.679 
be a shower of rain on Friday so it
could<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:26.939> bit<00:00:27.150> both<00:00:27.390> ways<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
could be a little bit both ways and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.990 
could be a little bit both ways and
obviously<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.410> Friday<00:00:28.710> we'll<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
obviously by Friday we'll know that the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
obviously by Friday we'll know that the
key<00:00:30.210> thing<00:00:30.449> though<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.840> we've<00:00:31.560> come<00:00:31.800> off

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
key thing though is that we've come off

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.060 
key thing though is that we've come off
the<00:00:32.040> back<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.579> heat<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.690> strong<00:00:34.140> heat

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the back of a very heat very strong heat

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.580 
the back of a very heat very strong heat
period<00:00:35.550> excessive<00:00:36.120> heat<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> people<00:00:37.410> need<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
period excessive heat and people need to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
period excessive heat and people need to
think<00:00:37.680> about<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> reflect<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.420> how<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
think about that and reflect on how it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
think about that and reflect on how it
impacted<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> means<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> what

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
impacted on them what it means and what

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.360 
impacted on them what it means and what
are<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> plans<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.600> people<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.110> have

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
are the plans that people need to have

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
are the plans that people need to have
because<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:44.910> people<00:00:44.940> reflect<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
because I think if people reflect it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
because I think if people reflect it
will<00:00:45.989> tell<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.620> either<00:00:46.950> build<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> plan

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
will tell them to either build a plan

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.369 
will tell them to either build a plan
that<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:47.879> may<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.230> too

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that they may not have and it's not too

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.740 
that they may not have and it's not too
late<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> build<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> plan<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.120> also<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.600> they've

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
late to build a plan and also if they've

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.540 
late to build a plan and also if they've
got<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> plan<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> might<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.800> allow<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
got a plan that might make allow them to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
got a plan that might make allow them to
modify<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:53.940> slightly<00:00:54.559> then<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> take<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
modify it slightly then if you take it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.670 
modify it slightly then if you take it
to<00:00:56.309> fire<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.030> same<00:00:57.270> scenario<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:58.469> about

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to fire the same scenario think about

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
to fire the same scenario think about
what<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> heat<00:00:59.489> does<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
what the heat does think about the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
what the heat does think about the
connection<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> fire<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:01.949> revisiting

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
connection to fire it's about revisiting

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
connection to fire it's about revisiting
what<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.019> think

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
what you do and how you do it I think

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620 
what you do and how you do it I think
Victorians<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.159> done<00:01:05.339> extremely<00:01:06.090> well<00:01:06.270> over

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

the fire potential is and has been but

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.440 
the fire potential is and has been but
we<00:01:21.630> need<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.020> sure<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.470> stay<00:01:22.619> focused<00:01:23.450> the
