don't think that they're gonna move
around<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.909> just<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> hang

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it was still stunned since it was

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.220 
it was still stunned since it was
blinking<00:02:25.490> from<00:02:25.670> earlier<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.780> that's<00:02:27.110> what

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
blinking from earlier and that's what

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.490 
blinking from earlier and that's what
happens<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.710> play<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.040> strong<00:02:28.280> party

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
