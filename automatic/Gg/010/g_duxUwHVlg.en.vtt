00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
definitely tell like say this is the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
definitely tell like say this is the
Xbox<00:01:12.570> controller<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
Xbox controller it's got kind of that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
Xbox controller it's got kind of that
roundness<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.140> hold<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> your

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
roundness to it but if you hold in your

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
roundness to it but if you hold in your
hand<00:01:16.890> compared<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> regular<00:01:17.729> wired<00:01:18.210> or

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
hand compared to a regular wired or

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
hand compared to a regular wired or
wireless<00:01:18.930> controller<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.130> definitely

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
wireless controller you can definitely

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.660 
wireless controller you can definitely
see<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> differences<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.960> wire<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.400> think

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
see the differences the wire is I think

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
see the differences the wire is I think
just<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.570> long<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.090> Xbox<00:01:27.439> wired

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
just as long as the Xbox wired

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
just as long as the Xbox wired
controller<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.540> little

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
controller it also has this little

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960 
controller it also has this little
breakaway<00:01:31.229> cable<00:01:31.650> same<00:01:32.040> thing<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.790> ends

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
breakaway cable same thing and it ends

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179 
breakaway cable same thing and it ends
in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> USB<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.229> use<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:35.009> your

it's<00:01:59.280> very<00:01:59.369> simple<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.390> anybody<00:02:00.750> wants<00:02:01.530> me

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it's very simple and if anybody wants me

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.830 
it's very simple and if anybody wants me
to<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> video<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.189> how<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.509> just

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to do a video on how to do it it's just

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
to do a video on how to do it it's just
opening<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> controller<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.100> swap

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
opening up the controller you can swap

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.169 
opening up the controller you can swap
out<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.390> sticks<00:02:07.020> very<00:02:07.110> easily<00:02:07.940> take<00:02:08.940> note

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
out the sticks very easily take note

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.600 
out the sticks very easily take note
though<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.869> buns<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.160> buns<00:02:11.400> are

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
though the buns you the buns are

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
though the buns you the buns are
different<00:02:12.030> from<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> standard<00:02:12.420> Xbox

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
different from a standard Xbox

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.860 
different from a standard Xbox
controller<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.620> not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
controller so you can not

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.020 
controller so you can not
about<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.260> buttons<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.830> cannot<00:02:15.519> swap<00:02:15.849> out

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
about the buttons you cannot swap out

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.820 
about the buttons you cannot swap out
the<00:02:16.209> bumpers<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:16.989> cannot<00:02:17.230> swap<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:17.680> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the bumpers and you cannot swap out the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.289 
the bumpers and you cannot swap out the
triggers<00:02:18.159> they're<00:02:18.340> all<00:02:18.489> very<00:02:18.849> slightly

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
triggers they're all very slightly

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.850 
triggers they're all very slightly
different<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.930> they're<00:02:20.409> not<00:02:20.530> compatible

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
different and they're not compatible

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.490 
different and they're not compatible
with<00:02:21.129> Xbox<00:02:21.670> parts<00:02:22.030> I'm<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:23.110> sure<00:02:23.230> about<00:02:23.319> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
with Xbox parts I'm not sure about the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.089 
with Xbox parts I'm not sure about the
d-pad<00:02:23.830> personally<00:02:24.310> I've<00:02:24.400> never<00:02:24.549> tried<00:02:24.760> that

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
d-pad personally I've never tried that

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.979 
d-pad personally I've never tried that
yeah<00:02:27.099> it's<00:02:27.250> got<00:02:27.400> dual<00:02:27.610> rumbles<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.629> very

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
yeah it's got dual rumbles it's very

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.630 
yeah it's got dual rumbles it's very
it's<00:02:29.409> like<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.560> very<00:02:29.799> cool<00:02:30.040> looking<00:02:30.280> controller

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
it's like a very cool looking controller

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.039 
it's like a very cool looking controller
you<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:30.970> see<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> inner<00:02:31.420> workings<00:02:31.870> of

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
you get to see all the inner workings of

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.170 
you get to see all the inner workings of
it<00:02:33.810> responds<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:35.349> good<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.220> guess<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.940> such<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
it responds it's good I guess for such a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.050 
it responds it's good I guess for such a
third-party<00:02:37.720> controller<00:02:38.230> I'd<00:02:39.040> say<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.819> terms

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
third-party controller I'd say in terms

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.149 
third-party controller I'd say in terms
of<00:02:40.299> how<00:02:40.360> comfortable<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.590> overall<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
of how comfortable it is and overall the

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.399 
of how comfortable it is and overall the
feel<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.760> build<00:02:43.060> quality<00:02:43.269> it's<00:02:44.140> way

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
feel of it the build quality it's way

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.809 
feel of it the build quality it's way
better<00:02:44.590> than<00:02:44.829> most<00:02:45.010> third-party<00:02:45.610> controllers

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
better than most third-party controllers

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.890 
better than most third-party controllers
especially<00:02:46.690> at<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.019> price<00:02:48.540> got<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
especially at this price got the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.190 
especially at this price got the
positionings<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.569> backend<00:02:52.569> start

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
positionings for the backend start

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.930 
positionings for the backend start
buttons<00:02:53.530> are<00:02:53.620> kind<00:02:53.859> of<00:02:53.890> weird<00:02:54.099> got<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.849> get

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
buttons are kind of weird got to get

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.210 
buttons are kind of weird got to get
used<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.709> you're<00:02:56.890> playing<00:02:57.099> a

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
used to that but if you're playing a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.240 
used to that but if you're playing a
game<00:02:57.629> which<00:02:58.629> requires<00:02:59.019> precision<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.799> analog

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
game which requires precision and analog

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.319 
game which requires precision and analog
controllers<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:01.030> mean<00:03:01.690> sticks<00:03:01.989> such<00:03:02.349> as<00:03:02.530> like

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
controllers I mean sticks such as like

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.160 
controllers I mean sticks such as like
first-person<00:03:04.329> shooters<00:03:04.629> like<00:03:04.750> Call<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.019> Duty

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
first-person shooters like Call of Duty

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.530 
first-person shooters like Call of Duty
especially<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.579> just<00:03:06.970> know<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:07.209> that's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
especially I just know because that's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.069 
especially I just know because that's
pretty<00:03:08.379> much<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.650> only<00:03:08.680> game<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.069> play<00:03:10.079> yeah

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
pretty much the only game I play yeah

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.680 
pretty much the only game I play yeah
this<00:03:11.620> controller<00:03:12.280> won't<00:03:12.970> really<00:03:13.299> fit<00:03:13.659> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
this controller won't really fit the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.990

this you know I can't I don't have any

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.940 
this you know I can't I don't have any
control<00:03:31.090> over<00:03:31.120> my<00:03:31.419> guy<00:03:31.569> but<00:03:32.290> at<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.530> same<00:03:32.709> time

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
control over my guy but at the same time

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.059 
control over my guy but at the same time
you<00:03:33.099> can't<00:03:33.280> hit<00:03:33.430> those<00:03:33.579> precise<00:03:34.060> shots<00:03:34.510> that

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
you can't hit those precise shots that

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.710 
you can't hit those precise shots that
people<00:03:36.069> that<00:03:36.700> take<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> game<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> little<00:03:37.480> more

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
people that take the game a little more

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.259 
people that take the game a little more
seriously<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.169> guess<00:03:38.440> would<00:03:38.879> look<00:03:39.879> for<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.209> a

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
seriously I guess would look for in a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.930 
seriously I guess would look for in a
controller<00:03:40.599> like<00:03:41.379> I<00:03:41.500> said<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.919> big<00:03:42.459> part<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.790> it

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
controller like I said a big part of it

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.640 
controller like I said a big part of it
is<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.120> thumb<00:03:43.449> sticks<00:03:43.720> they<00:03:44.079> feel<00:03:44.319> really

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
is a thumb sticks they feel really

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.520 
is a thumb sticks they feel really
slippery<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.459> original<00:03:45.819> ones<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.530> they're

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
slippery the original ones and they're
