said<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.270> very<00:02:29.300> well<00:02:29.660> thought-out<00:02:29.989> designs

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
said it's very well thought-out designs

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.380 
said it's very well thought-out designs
this<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.010> lille<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:31.519> some<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.850> these<00:02:31.910> cards<00:02:32.239> can

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
this is lille if some of these cards can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.509 
this is lille if some of these cards can
actually<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.810> evolved<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:33.709> lilith<00:02:34.070> says<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
actually be evolved so lilith says it

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually be evolved so lilith says it
can<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:34.880> transmigrated<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.200> means<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.470> can

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
can be transmigrated that means it can

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.979 
can be transmigrated that means it can
be<00:02:36.620> evolved<00:02:37.220> at<00:02:37.730> least<00:02:38.030> once<00:02:38.420> i<00:02:38.750> believe

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
be evolved at least once i believe

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.080 
be evolved at least once i believe
there's<00:02:39.170> only<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.470> stage<00:02:39.709> evolution<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.970> if

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
there's only one stage evolution and if

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.910 
there's only one stage evolution and if
now<00:02:41.269> show<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.600> guys<00:02:41.840> how<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.410> actually

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
now show you guys how to actually

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.660 
now show you guys how to actually
enhance<00:02:43.040> your<00:02:43.519> demons<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.709> basically<00:02:46.489> you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
enhance your demons so basically you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.640 
enhance your demons so basically you
pick<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.940> card<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:47.780> case<00:02:47.989> pipe<00:02:48.320> Fox

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
pick a card and in this case pipe Fox

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.460 
pick a card and in this case pipe Fox
and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.519> can<00:02:49.670> choose<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.630> or<00:02:50.660> more<00:02:51.019> of

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
and then you can choose one or more of

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.520 
and then you can choose one or more of
your<00:02:51.890> other<00:02:52.040> cards<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:53.420> enhanced<00:02:53.989> material

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
your other cards as enhanced material

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.830 
your other cards as enhanced material
muscial<00:02:55.130> bulk<00:02:55.370> fusion<00:02:55.850> here<00:02:56.299> means<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.660> you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
muscial bulk fusion here means that you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.160 
muscial bulk fusion here means that you
can<00:02:56.989> choose<00:02:57.260> up<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> ten<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.160> your<00:02:58.579> cards<00:02:59.049> to<00:03:00.049> be

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
can choose up to ten of your cards to be

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.050 
can choose up to ten of your cards to be
used<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.680> evolution<00:03:01.400> I'm<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.790> going<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.940> use

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
used in evolution I'm just going to use

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.009 
used in evolution I'm just going to use
black<00:03:02.299> angel<00:03:02.840> here<00:03:03.049> non<00:03:03.560> racist<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:04.190> all

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
black angel here non racist at all

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.360 
black angel here non racist at all
obviously<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.320> bulk<00:03:07.190> fusion<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:10.250> gonna

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
obviously and bulk fusion and it's gonna

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.250 
obviously and bulk fusion and it's gonna
use<00:03:10.730> some<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.360> silver<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.049> have

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
use some of the silver that you have

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.990 
use some of the silver that you have
which<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.680> an<00:03:12.890> urn

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
which is an urn

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.360 
which is an urn
basically<00:03:16.000> there<00:03:16.270> boom<00:03:16.660> now<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> card<00:03:18.040> levels

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
basically there boom now I card levels

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.260 
basically there boom now I card levels
up<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.960> it<00:03:19.960> games<00:03:20.610> attack<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.820> defense<00:03:22.090> as

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
up and it games attack and defense as

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.040 
up and it games attack and defense as
well<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:23.080> it's<00:03:23.200> games<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.700> if<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.450> has<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> skill

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
well so it's games and if it has a skill

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.290 
well so it's games and if it has a skill
there's<00:03:26.380> also<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.650> chance<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.790> skill

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
there's also a chance that that skill

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.960 
there's also a chance that that skill
can<00:03:28.540> also<00:03:28.660> be<00:03:28.870> leveled<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.610> that's<00:03:30.700> pretty

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
can also be leveled up so that's pretty

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.430 
can also be leveled up so that's pretty
much<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.570> elements<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.550> game

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
much that elements of the of the game

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.610 
much that elements of the of the game
the<00:03:35.440> lag<00:03:35.950> in<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.490> game<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:36.940> not<00:03:37.600> too<00:03:37.840> bad<00:03:38.050> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
the lag in this game is not too bad the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.340 
the lag in this game is not too bad the

life
that'd<00:06:23.240> be<00:06:23.300> pretty<00:06:23.570> helpful<00:06:23.930> and<00:06:25.330> pretty<00:06:26.330> much

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
that'd be pretty helpful and pretty much

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.720 
that'd be pretty helpful and pretty much
that's<00:06:26.720> the<00:06:26.960> main<00:06:27.470> mechanics<00:06:28.160> it's<00:06:28.370> pretty

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
that's the main mechanics it's pretty

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.510 
that's the main mechanics it's pretty
bare-bones<00:06:29.240> in<00:06:29.840> my<00:06:29.990> humble<00:06:30.200> opinion<00:06:30.380> at<00:06:30.980> the

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
bare-bones in my humble opinion at the

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.320 
bare-bones in my humble opinion at the
event<00:06:31.820> you<00:06:32.120> can<00:06:32.270> rank<00:06:32.600> against<00:06:33.020> other<00:06:33.170> players

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
event you can rank against other players

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.270 
event you can rank against other players
but<00:06:35.330> basically<00:06:36.080> you<00:06:36.230> have<00:06:36.350> to<00:06:36.470> pay<00:06:36.770> to<00:06:36.830> buy<00:06:37.250> a

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
but basically you have to pay to buy a

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.980 
but basically you have to pay to buy a
lot<00:06:37.640> of<00:06:37.790> the<00:06:37.850> items<00:06:38.240> in<00:06:38.450> the<00:06:38.540> game<00:06:38.750> to

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
lot of the items in the game to

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.660 
lot of the items in the game to
replenish<00:06:39.260> your<00:06:39.410> enemy<00:06:39.770> constantly<00:06:40.490> in<00:06:40.580> order

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
replenish your enemy constantly in order

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.030 
replenish your enemy constantly in order
to<00:06:40.850> actually<00:06:41.210> stand<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.840> chance<00:06:41.870> to<00:06:42.320> be<00:06:42.410> one<00:06:42.950> of

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040
