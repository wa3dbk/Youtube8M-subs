00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.430
 me that others who praises and we find ourselves 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.690
 today for a new video so 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.730
 after two weeks of absence 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.960
 not very serious in passing a worry 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 it did not happen to me if I did not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 Too much want to make videos so 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.170
 here we are in general melee on the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 maaf tank with a map a map 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.190
 everything is fine with a soul so l 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 silent apn charge large cape at 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.270
 passage had a little bit of the war 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.890
 will not have much doubt during the game 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.390
 so here's during this part I'm going 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.010
 tempt fashion so as you need 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 certainly you doubt it about my 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.570
 chain most of the gameplay it's 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.949
 mangou attempts then dgamp the sniper 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.059
 this one is an attempt words here 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.879
 so I 'm not telling you if I 'm going to see her 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 I'm going to miss it anyway 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.059
 so I really have a connection 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 pitiful whether it's on now 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.730
 do 3 or globally for youtube etc 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.030
 etc. 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.019
 so it makes me a little shit the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.050
 game makes you this video because I have 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.809
 several things to tell you 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.640
 firstly a pretty important topic 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 even completely important finally except 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.940
 if some of you do not care 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.920
 completely but well I do not think so 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.299
 go on xbox so I explain myself 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.250
 fucking about youtube hours who 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.960
 pass on xbox 2 1 I do not consider myself 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 like a big youtuber that's me 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 consider me independent I am 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.939
 not yet obliged to tell me how 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.930
 bend to certain wishes of my 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.740
 subscribers finally I mean I have not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 enough of how to say public for 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.960
 having to make those choices there and it was 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.899
 So there certainly understand 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.579
 I made the choice to go on xbox 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.350
 simply because open wheels has 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.609
 had a big fat lag then justin series 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.170
 I do not know why 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.340
 so I made the choice to go on 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 this platform just because 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.700
 already October 31st halloween day 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.899
 it's my birthday so me it's 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.920
 so I do not have too much money and where 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.180
 I tell myself it's a day I want 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.170
 switch to xbox it's now or 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.170
 never simply 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.020
 and so here it is here I will have my xbox 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.549
 elite not too much what the 31 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 October so early beginning of November 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.939
 and I'm going to go so this is the second 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.960
 something I would like to talk about I 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.390
 will come back on the xbox a little bit 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.930
 later I will go 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.789
 in paris games week so the then 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.899
 wait I say no bullshit I do not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.970
 do not know exactly the date 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.260
 in any case I will go with the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 frog hd so florian and the black hawk 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.470
 13 benjamins 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 here I am going to go with them two 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.230
 maybe there will be maybe there will be one or 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.670
 two more people I do not know anything about 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.160
 anyway this frag will have him a t-shirt 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.180
 special and sure and certain he will have 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.010
 his shirt I do not know exactly 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.480
 how will he be anyway he'll talk about it 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.830
 on his channel by then 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.420
 I would not have a special shirt 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.500
 because I do not think that here too 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 you go there it's not necessarily for 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.300
 me and more ways I will be with the former 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.800
 of frags and the black hawk so so 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.660
 simply we'll see it on the spot I 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.430
 mean there is nothing pressing 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.920
 take our time to come back a little 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.360
 little xbox so this is an xbox 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.160
 com wanted to say he does not touch too much 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.300
 whatever I'm going to have I'll see her 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.820
 especially for black ops 2 1 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.860
 so I really expect it with 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.540
 impatience 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.160
 it may be complicated for me 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.880
 since we will have to get used to the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.890
 joystick etc 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.130
 I laugh I may have a start 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.750
 difficult on xbox but hey listen on 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.850
 although it will go flawlessly 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.350
 1 franceschi that's what works the 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.160
 the better it is I'll be a pgm 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.790
 of the xbox really trick too impossible 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.110
 so here we go 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.850
 at the level of gameplay yeah I'm 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.350
 mainly in this building for 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.590
 come back at a time I had made a 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.850
 mob tutorial series in scrum and all 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.680
 did not know too much market I did 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.910
 on resistance could take that as 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.829
 a tutorial so here's what I tell you 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.299
 advises it's really about staying on 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.350
 this around this building especially that the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.120
 peace is threatened the best weapon for 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.670
 the body-to-body personally it's 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.560
 my point of view I could have put 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.299
 also quick shot on it's true 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.820
 than with loading big capacity more shooting 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.590
 fast it's really a carnage a 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.940
 butcher bakery what you want 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.739
 in any case what I advise you 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.090
 like configuration with this thing it's 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.200
 already never targeted so to put 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.870
 fast and solid in third trump 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.850
 obligatorily in first at all but 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.450
 you are stone pro looters because 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.489
 it is 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.480
 it's essential simply you have 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.530
 need a lot of bullets what that 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.420
 is very very very fast especially and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.950
 small rapids then second trump you 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.510
 put determination for them 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.680
 audience and to get past pass 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.370
 directly first to all 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.260
 specialists 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.940
 and then that's it I think you'll be 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.940
 well you will have ammunition from the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.319
 power can charge very quickly with 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.569
 pass goes first asset 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.790
 specialists and then shot you in judgment 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.280
 and it will do a lot of damage 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.889
 no where's that where you see I'm at 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.979
 950 times already I will go to 1000 I 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.860
 believe do not wait on a yes 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.410
 yes basically at 1,950 points which 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.300
 means that I'm waiting 19 he 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.919
 loose and at 20 so that's a thousand 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.300
 points so vain that they know 1 0 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.590
 always in the small building and 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.940
 look at a the job guy you I'm going 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.560
 insist and season and ben he died there 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.380
 did lille did the guy so he's 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.479
 death he suffered the consequences of these 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.509
 of cézac so basically I made it 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.070
 at twenty minutes it's telling you that already 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.080
 that part lag and in addition I go there 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.070
 go back and I'm going to get killed there 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.360
 had last battles of the hands 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.690
 of deaths during this part is enough 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.630
 shitting 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.240
 look here is the guy jbg ullens 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.550
 mons and 4 and it did not explode once 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.599
 So here I am going to do what lg con 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.919
 as I am I will go back 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.970
 and what will happen when 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.280
 I was going to go back down you'll see 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.389
 it's really pretty annoying I want 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.740
 to say look at how this lag is 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.419
 unplayable it's impossible to play 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.250
 watch I'm silent the time jeans 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.229
 4 seed and I do explode with 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.659
 double because nothing and that's it explodes 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.419
 not so enraged that's all 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.440
 simply 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.699
 I hope this little video you 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.780
 will have pleased anyway tell me what 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.370
 you think about it in the comments 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.020
 tell me what you think of my 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.460
 passage on xbox even though it's clear that 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.770
 you will not change your mind I think 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.990
 we can all we do not need to 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.650
 hide it from hiding things at the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.650
 next lease
