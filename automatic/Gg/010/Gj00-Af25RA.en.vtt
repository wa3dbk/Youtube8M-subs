Hey guys Steve Drennon from Rightlook.com
here today I wanted to talk to you about one

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.360
of our new cutting edge pieces of equipment,
we’re talking about our low pressure washer

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.610
skid mount unit. Check this out guys. This
is a unit that was designed for individuals

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:42.569
that are interested in doing low pressure
washing. I know in the industry today, a lot

00:00:42.569 --> 00:01:12.260
of individuals are looking to use as little
water as possible; being eco friendly, environmentally

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:29.110
friendly, and this package has it all right
here.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:50.270
We do happen to have this in a SUV but you
could use this in a van, in a pick-up truck,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.270
in all types of different vehicles, it’s
a very versatile unit and definitely cutting

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.270
edge technology. I’m going to take you real
quick through some the components that we

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.460
here.
We have a smaller water tank, 40 gallons,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.240
but remember it’s a low pressure system
so you’re using less water that means you

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.911
can do more vehicles. We have the low pressure
unit right here which is actually electric

00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:02.911
as oppose to a gas powered pressure washer
you would utilize so your low pressure unit

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:03.911
would actually directly plug into your Honda
generator and operate that way.

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:04.911
The low-pressure pressure washer gun that
is adjustable and then you have the hose reel

00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:05.911
which is 25 feet of retractable hose, this
is awesome guys. And then you’ll notice

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:16.319
here that we have the Honda EU 2000, this
is one of their quiet generators, it’s a

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:38.580
smaller one, its designed to fit specifically
in here so you can actually have it in your

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:48.500
SUV. It actually has special bracketry here
so if necessary and if you want to you can

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.810
unhook it and remove it. If you have it in
the back of a cargo van or pickup truck you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.660
can just leave it attached to it and there’s
also a way to lock it in here as well.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.880
There’s several options that we have, this
happens to be the Metro Vac vacuum unit, there’s

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.349
different options you can have for a blower
or vacuum so definitely speak to one of the

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.340
Rightlook consultants and you can build the
package the way that you want it. You’ll

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.300
notice here, same with the other skid mounts
we really like to have that professional look

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.270
so we have the diamond plated deck and also
the black steel powder coated frame, which

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.280
is signature for Rightlook skid mounts.
