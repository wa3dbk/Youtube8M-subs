engineer<00:00:08.160> 775<00:00:09.030> here<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.570> wanted<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.930> ask<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
engineer 775 here I wanted to ask you a

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.980 
engineer 775 here I wanted to ask you a
question<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:10.950> ever<00:00:11.070> been<00:00:11.370> ripped<00:00:11.639> off

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
question have you ever been ripped off

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.570 
question have you ever been ripped off
has<00:00:12.990> anybody<00:00:13.200> ever<00:00:13.440> sold<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> battery<00:00:14.219> they

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
has anybody ever sold you a battery they

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.000 
has anybody ever sold you a battery they
said<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.969> good<00:00:15.209> but<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.539> really<00:00:15.719> wasn't<00:00:16.020> well

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
said was good but it really wasn't well

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.550 
said was good but it really wasn't well
I<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.400> I've<00:00:17.670> had<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.090> very<00:00:18.330> large<00:00:18.630> 88<00:00:19.350> D

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I have I've had some very large 88 D

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.230 
I have I've had some very large 88 D
batteries<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.310> folks<00:00:20.730> said<00:00:20.940> that<00:00:21.090> would

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
batteries that folks said that would

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.169 
batteries that folks said that would
they<00:00:21.390> were<00:00:21.510> good<00:00:22.160> they<00:00:23.160> registered<00:00:23.699> fine<00:00:23.970> with

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
they were good they registered fine with

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.900 
they were good they registered fine with
a<00:00:24.210> voltmeter<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.460> didn't<00:00:26.759> mean

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
a voltmeter but the that didn't mean

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.089 
a voltmeter but the that didn't mean
that<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.210> were<00:00:27.300> good<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> plates<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.070> be

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that they were good so the plates can be

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
that they were good so the plates can be
all<00:00:29.310> sulfated<00:00:29.999> nichkhun<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> battery<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.869> be

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
all sulfated nichkhun the battery can be

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.630 
all sulfated nichkhun the battery can be
a<00:00:30.990> complete<00:00:32.270> dead<00:00:33.270> battery<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.490> one<00:00:35.490> of<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
a complete dead battery so one of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
a complete dead battery so one of the
things<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.060> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> share<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.990> there's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
things I want to share with you there's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
things I want to share with you there's
two<00:00:37.489> troubleshooting<00:00:38.489> others<00:00:38.820> there's<00:00:39.270> three

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
two troubleshooting others there's three

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
two troubleshooting others there's three
of<00:00:39.600> simple<00:00:40.140> homemade<00:00:40.469> obviously<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> test<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
of simple homemade obviously to test the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.510 
of simple homemade obviously to test the
voltage<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.600> battery<00:00:42.960> charged<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.649> then

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
voltage is the battery charged and then

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.420 
voltage is the battery charged and then
a<00:00:44.820> hydrometer<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:46.350> tests<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.859> specific

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a hydrometer which tests the specific

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.720 
a hydrometer which tests the specific
gravity<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:49.219> contents<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> battery

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
gravity of the contents of the battery

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580 
gravity of the contents of the battery
this<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.140> temperature

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
this one I like because it's temperature

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
this one I like because it's temperature
compensated<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.519> cool<00:00:53.730> morning<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.329> it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
compensated it's a cool morning so it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.740 
compensated it's a cool morning so it's
telling<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> subtract<00:00:57.379> 14<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.699> the

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
telling me to subtract 14 from the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
telling me to subtract 14 from the
reading<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.620> actual<00:01:02.100> float<00:01:02.519> in<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
reading on the actual float in the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.970 
reading on the actual float in the
hydrometer<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> temperature

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
hydrometer so it's a temperature

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.120 
hydrometer so it's a temperature
compensated<00:01:05.790> battery<00:01:06.450> checker<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.800> is<00:01:07.950> just

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
compensated battery checker this is just

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
compensated battery checker this is just
testing<00:01:08.520> specific<00:01:09.060> gravity<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.480> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
testing specific gravity which is a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.570 
testing specific gravity which is a
great<00:01:09.840> test<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> might<00:01:11.370> not<00:01:11.400> be

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
great test but it might not be

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.810 
great test but it might not be
sufficient<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.230> what<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.550> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
sufficient and so what you can do and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.220 
sufficient and so what you can do and
none<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.330> expensive<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.900> forgot

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
none of these are expensive I forgot

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.720 
none of these are expensive I forgot
this<00:01:16.410> I'm<00:01:16.710> gonna<00:01:16.800> put<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.040> link<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
this I'm gonna put a link to this I

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.150 
this I'm gonna put a link to this I
think<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.420> ten<00:01:18.570> dollars<00:01:18.690> but<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
think it's ten dollars but you want to

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.440 
think it's ten dollars but you want to
be<00:01:20.400> able<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.550> check<00:01:20.760> your<00:01:20.790> lead<00:01:21.060> acid

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
be able to check your lead acid

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.360 
be able to check your lead acid

hold<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> button<00:01:57.900> down<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.580> if<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.730> stays<00:01:59.970> in

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
hold the button down and if it stays in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.000 
hold the button down and if it stays in
the<00:02:00.360> good<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.750> heading<00:02:01.020> towards<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.440> weak<00:02:01.650> I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
the good it's heading towards the weak I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.070 
the good it's heading towards the weak I
knew<00:02:02.760> it<00:02:02.880> wasn't<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> best<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.660> batteries<00:02:03.960> but

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
knew it wasn't the best of batteries but

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.960 
knew it wasn't the best of batteries but
it's<00:02:04.230> also<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.620> state<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.070> charge<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.460> low<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
it's also the state of charge is low and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.710 
it's also the state of charge is low and
you'll<00:02:06.870> see<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.170> glow<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:08.330> that's<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you'll see the glow and that's what the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.170 
you'll see the glow and that's what the
the<00:02:10.259> testers<00:02:10.679> doing<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.000> heat

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the testers doing is just it's a heat

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.509 
the testers doing is just it's a heat
load<00:02:12.560> resistive<00:02:13.560> heating<00:02:13.590> heat<00:02:14.280> load<00:02:14.519> that's

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
load resistive heating heat load that's

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.570 
load resistive heating heat load that's
keeping<00:02:17.519> me<00:02:17.640> warm<00:02:17.849> on<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.239> cool

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
keeping me warm on this cool

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.090 
keeping me warm on this cool
but<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.480> battery<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.930> testing<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.410> good<00:02:20.680> for

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
but this battery is testing out good for

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.010 
but this battery is testing out good for
a<00:02:21.160> load<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.540> gonna<00:02:25.690> throw<00:02:25.930> that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
a load and so I'm not gonna throw that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.630 
a load and so I'm not gonna throw that
away<00:02:26.230> I'm<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.800> going<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.040> trade<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.520> lot

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
away I'm not going to trade it in a lot

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.680 
away I'm not going to trade it in a lot
of<00:02:27.670> people<00:02:27.910> get<00:02:28.030> rid<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.300> batteries

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
of people get rid of the batteries

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.260 
of people get rid of the batteries
before<00:02:28.840> they're<00:02:29.590> either<00:02:29.910> haven't<00:02:30.910> charged

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
before they're either haven't charged

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.440 
before they're either haven't charged
the<00:02:31.450> battery<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.140> battery's<00:02:32.500> fine<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.580> so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
the battery the battery's fine and so

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.900 
the battery the battery's fine and so
these<00:02:34.810> two<00:02:35.020> tools<00:02:35.260> are<00:02:35.500> great<00:02:35.830> obviously<00:02:36.790> add

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
these two tools are great obviously add

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.700 
these two tools are great obviously add
a<00:02:36.940> voltmeter<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.510> these<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.170> tools<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:38.680> a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
a voltmeter to these the tools but a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.920 
a voltmeter to these the tools but a
hydrometer<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:40.030> load<00:02:40.210> tester<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.750> won't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
hydrometer and a load tester you won't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.510 
hydrometer and a load tester you won't
spend<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.260> lot<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.410> money<00:02:41.590> it'll<00:02:42.010> save<00:02:42.340> you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
spend a lot of money it'll save you

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.580 
spend a lot of money it'll save you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.890 
money if I had these that day that guy
was<00:02:44.770> selling<00:02:44.980> me<00:02:45.190> those<00:02:45.370> renewable<00:02:46.270> energy

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
was selling me those renewable energy

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.960 
was selling me those renewable energy
batteries<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.500> were<00:02:47.650> junk<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.250> would<00:02:48.880> have

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
batteries that were junk I would have

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.970 
batteries that were junk I would have
said<00:02:49.210> I<00:02:49.240> would<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.600> been<00:02:49.930> able<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.170> buy<00:02:50.350> three

your<00:03:05.800> batteries<00:03:06.070> are<00:03:06.220> good<00:03:06.340> or<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:07.210> don't

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
your batteries are good or you don't

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.880 
your batteries are good or you don't
want<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.540> throw<00:03:07.780> your<00:03:07.900> batteries<00:03:08.290> away<00:03:08.530> before

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
want to throw your batteries away before

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.250 
want to throw your batteries away before
their<00:03:09.040> time<00:03:09.250> or<00:03:09.520> chain<00:03:09.910> turn<00:03:10.360> them<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:10.900> use

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
their time or chain turn them in so use

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.740 
their time or chain turn them in so use
these<00:03:11.500> three<00:03:11.860> these<00:03:12.280> great<00:03:12.550> tools<00:03:12.790> okay<00:03:13.360> I

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
these three these great tools okay I

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720 
these three these great tools okay I
think<00:03:14.290> that's<00:03:14.740> it<00:03:14.980> let's<00:03:15.190> go<00:03:15.280> look<00:03:15.400> at<00:03:15.520> some

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
think that's it let's go look at some

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.600 
think that's it let's go look at some
other<00:03:15.820> batteries<00:03:16.530> okay<00:03:17.530> oh<00:03:17.710> no<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.370> these

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
other batteries okay oh no on these

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.690 
other batteries okay oh no on these
batteries<00:03:18.820> again<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.600> hydrometer

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
batteries again you the hydrometer

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.530 
batteries again you the hydrometer
obviously<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.760> want<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> check<00:03:22.150> these<00:03:22.330> from

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
obviously you want to check these from

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.690 
obviously you want to check these from
time<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.930> time<00:03:22.959> because<00:03:23.440> these<00:03:23.890> batteries<00:03:24.670> are

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
time to time because these batteries are

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.370 
time to time because these batteries are
lead-acid<00:03:26.130> they<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:27.700> vent<00:03:28.060> gases<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.140> so

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
lead-acid they they vent gases and so

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.770 
lead-acid they they vent gases and so
they're<00:03:29.560> losing<00:03:29.910> they're<00:03:30.910> losing<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.330> fluid

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
they're losing they're losing the fluid

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.530 
they're losing they're losing the fluid
so<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.770> add<00:03:33.100> distilled<00:03:33.550> water<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.239> them<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so you add distilled water to them to

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
so you add distilled water to them to
top<00:03:34.750> them<00:03:34.930> off<00:03:35.110> from<00:03:35.230> time<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.590> time<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.890> just

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
top them off from time to time you just

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.350 
top them off from time to time you just
got<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.220> keep<00:03:36.310> an<00:03:36.459> eye<00:03:36.550> on<00:03:36.580> them<00:03:36.790> yes<00:03:37.030> they<00:03:37.209> make

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
got to keep an eye on them yes they make

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.240 
got to keep an eye on them yes they make
automatic<00:03:37.840> water<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.440> I'm<00:03:38.650> going<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.860> suck<00:03:39.100> up

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
automatic water so I'm going to suck up

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.220 
automatic water so I'm going to suck up
some<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:41.020> battery<00:03:41.380> acid<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:43.180> can<00:03:43.330> see<00:03:44.220> by

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
some the battery acid and you can see by

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.260 
some the battery acid and you can see by
the<00:03:47.230> Green<00:03:47.470> Zone<00:03:47.500> I'm<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.370> Green<00:03:48.580> Zone<00:03:48.610> on

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
the Green Zone I'm in the Green Zone on

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.560 
the Green Zone I'm in the Green Zone on
here<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.140> again<00:03:50.440> if<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.220> am<00:03:51.250> just<00:03:51.520> because<00:03:52.480> of

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
here and again if I am just because of

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.060 
here and again if I am just because of
the<00:03:52.660> temperatures<00:03:53.140> telling<00:03:53.530> me<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.650> subtract

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
the temperatures telling me you subtract

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:04.979 
the temperatures telling me you subtract
off<00:03:54.250> 13<00:03:55.150> off<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:57.510> hydrometer<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:04.720> still

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
off 13 off the hydrometer so I'm still

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.949 
off 13 off the hydrometer so I'm still
gonna<00:04:05.080> be<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.160> good<00:04:06.340> zone<00:04:06.610> okay<00:04:07.300> I'm<00:04:07.690> still

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
gonna be in the good zone okay I'm still

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.080 
gonna be in the good zone okay I'm still
the<00:04:08.080> good<00:04:08.170> zone<00:04:08.410> on<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:09.970> these

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
the good zone on this and so these

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.880 
the good zone on this and so these
batteries<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.570> tested<00:04:11.080> out<00:04:11.200> I've<00:04:11.500> tested

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
batteries have tested out I've tested

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.650 
batteries have tested out I've tested
both<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.220> them<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.610> they're<00:04:12.940> very<00:04:12.970> good<00:04:13.360> I

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
both of them and they're very good I

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.140 
both of them and they're very good I
just<00:04:14.530> check<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.040> cell<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.280> don't<00:04:15.670> need<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.880> add

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
just check the cell I don't need to add

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.000 
just check the cell I don't need to add
any<00:04:16.359> more<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.600> still<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.080> logger<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.530> them<00:04:17.709> I

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
to make sure you keep them floated just

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.610 
to make sure you keep them floated just
because<00:04:36.729> it<00:04:36.879> can<00:04:37.030> deep-cycle<00:04:37.870> don't

deep-cycle your batteries that's how you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.320 
deep-cycle your batteries that's how you
kill<00:04:40.300> batteries<00:04:40.979> so<00:04:41.979> you<00:04:42.400> know<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.210> there<00:04:43.300> are

buttons some of those and tracks have
those<00:05:00.189> and<00:05:00.699> they<00:05:01.689> will<00:05:01.960> run<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.710> voltage<00:05:03.069> up

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
those and they will run the voltage up

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.089 
those and they will run the voltage up
on<00:05:03.400> say<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> 12<00:05:03.940> volt<00:05:04.150> battery<00:05:04.229> around<00:05:05.229> 15<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.069> a

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
on say a 12 volt battery around 15 and a

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.730 
on say a 12 volt battery around 15 and a
half<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.490> 16<00:05:06.909> volts<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.419> that<00:05:07.479> burns<00:05:07.930> off<00:05:08.349> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
half to 16 volts and that burns off the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.610 
half to 16 volts and that burns off the
sulphate<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:10.000> sulfation<00:05:10.449> that's<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.289> the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
sulphate the sulfation that's on the the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.890 
sulphate the sulfation that's on the the
plates<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.219> lead<00:05:12.400> plates<00:05:12.729> gets<00:05:13.419> rid<00:05:13.659> of<00:05:13.690> that

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
plates the lead plates gets rid of that

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.839 
plates the lead plates gets rid of that
so<00:05:14.110> it<00:05:14.259> kind<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:14.590> renews<00:05:14.949> that<00:05:15.219> battery<00:05:15.639> a

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
so it kind of renews that battery a

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.850 
so it kind of renews that battery a
normal<00:05:16.330> charger<00:05:17.110> like<00:05:17.259> this<00:05:17.409> will<00:05:17.590> not

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
normal charger like this will not

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.209 
normal charger like this will not
equalize<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.639> battery<00:05:19.240> but<00:05:19.860> unless<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:20.949> spend

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
equalize a battery but unless you spend

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.890 
equalize a battery but unless you spend
the<00:05:21.340> money<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.759> get<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.060> charger<00:05:22.599> that<00:05:22.779> will

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
the money to get a charger that will

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.320 
the money to get a charger that will
actually<00:05:23.080> equalize<00:05:23.969> you<00:05:24.969> can<00:05:25.150> definitely

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
actually equalize you can definitely

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.820 
actually equalize you can definitely
hurt<00:05:25.659> your<00:05:25.810> batteries<00:05:26.199> that<00:05:26.349> way<00:05:26.529> so<00:05:26.590> it's

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
hurt your batteries that way so it's

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.730 
hurt your batteries that way so it's
poured<00:05:27.039> on<00:05:27.129> a<00:05:27.219> let<00:05:27.370> acid<00:05:27.729> now<00:05:27.909> on<00:05:28.000> an<00:05:28.120> AGM

a gel as well that equalization isn't as
much<00:05:36.879> of<00:05:37.180> an<00:05:37.300> issue<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:39.190> other<00:05:39.310> thing<00:05:39.520> is

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
much of an issue the other thing is

is<00:06:14.469> what<00:06:14.830> these<00:06:14.979> were<00:06:15.190> I'll<00:06:15.339> show<00:06:15.490> I'll<00:06:15.669> put<00:06:15.789> a

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
is what these were I'll show I'll put a

is what these were I'll show I'll put a
link<00:06:16.000> in<00:06:16.180> there<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.599> they're<00:06:16.750> not<00:06:16.779> bad

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
link in there and they're not bad

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.930 
link in there and they're not bad
they'll<00:06:17.469> save<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:17.740> a<00:06:17.770> lot<00:06:17.860> of<00:06:17.919> money<00:06:18.069> okay<00:06:18.909> I

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
they'll save you a lot of money okay I

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.570

think<00:06:19.150> that's<00:06:19.389> enough<00:06:19.569> a<00:06:20.469> little<00:06:20.889> battery

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580
