00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.040 
the way yeah I won Formula Renault and
in<00:02:34.560> Formula<00:02:35.040> three<00:02:35.690> unfortunately<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> didn't

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
in Formula three unfortunately I didn't

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.710 
in Formula three unfortunately I didn't
win<00:02:37.200> GP<00:02:37.560> 2<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> finished<00:02:38.250> third<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.790> second

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
win GP 2 but I finished third and second

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.559 
win GP 2 but I finished third and second
in<00:02:39.840> what<00:02:40.019> say<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.590> was<00:02:40.769> quite<00:02:41.549> good<00:02:41.760> record

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
in what say so it was quite good record

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.930 
in what say so it was quite good record
I<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:42.900> something<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.890> found<00:02:44.099> tough<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.580> when

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
I think something I found tough is when

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940 
I think something I found tough is when
you're<00:02:45.239> coming<00:02:45.480> through<00:02:45.569> your<00:02:46.380> winning<00:02:46.709> races

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you're coming through your winning races

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.009 
you're coming through your winning races
and<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.400> expect<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.880> be<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.180> pole<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> having

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
and you expect to be on pole and having

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.600 
and you expect to be on pole and having
great<00:02:49.290> days<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.799> then<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:49.950> hit<00:02:50.069> formula<00:02:50.459> 1

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
great days and then you hit formula 1

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.460 
great days and then you hit formula 1
and<00:02:50.819> it's<00:02:51.599> different<00:02:51.930> isn't<00:02:52.110> it

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and it's different isn't it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130 
and it's different isn't it
it's<00:02:53.010> different<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.700> obviously<00:02:54.269> yeah<00:02:54.720> we

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it's different because obviously yeah we

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.559 
it's different because obviously yeah we
are<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.470> realistic<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.700> want<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:57.329> know

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
are really realistic we we want we know

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.830 
are really realistic we we want we know
I'll<00:02:57.870> do<00:02:58.049> some<00:02:58.260> podium<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.610> I<00:03:00.000> think<00:03:00.420> when<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
I'll do some podium so I think when you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.479 
I'll do some podium so I think when you
come<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.010> different

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
come here you have you have different

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.150 
come here you have you have different
targets<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.030> know<00:03:03.380> like<00:03:04.380> for<00:03:04.709> them<00:03:04.860> for

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
targets you know like for them for

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.130 
targets you know like for them for
example<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:05.700> year<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.360> target<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:06.900> us<00:03:06.930> is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
example this year the target for us is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.500 
example this year the target for us is
to<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.440> front<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.769> Caterham<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.329> do

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
to be in front of Caterham so if we do

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.300 
to be in front of Caterham so if we do
it<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.079> victory<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.069> said

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
it it's like a victory so it said

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.190 
it it's like a victory so it said
something<00:03:11.579> different<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.329> imagine<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
something different I imagine on the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.350 
something different I imagine on the
grid<00:03:13.530> you're<00:03:13.860> very<00:03:14.160> calm<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> start<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.299> a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
grid you're very calm at the start of a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.809 
grid you're very calm at the start of a
race<00:03:15.510> yeah<00:03:16.079> I'm<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.739> calm<00:03:16.920> actually<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.489> am

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
race yeah I'm really calm actually I am

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.930 
race yeah I'm really calm actually I am
more<00:03:18.690> calm<00:03:18.930> DC<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.829> Formula<00:03:20.250> 1<00:03:20.430> than<00:03:20.639> I<00:03:20.670> was

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
more calm DC in Formula 1 than I was

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.199 
more calm DC in Formula 1 than I was
before<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:22.069> in<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.250> previous<00:03:23.639> day<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:23.850> I

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
before in in in the previous day so I

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.720 
before in in in the previous day so I
don't<00:03:24.389> know<00:03:24.569> why<00:03:24.750> maybe<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.230> because<00:03:25.609> we<00:03:26.609> are

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
don't know why maybe it's because we are

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.090 
don't know why maybe it's because we are
in<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.970> back<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.420> grid<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.109> anyway<00:03:29.010> I'm

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
in the back of the grid but anyway I'm

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.620 
in the back of the grid but anyway I'm
not<00:03:29.130> sure<00:03:29.430> because<00:03:29.579> we<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.180> still<00:03:30.389> pressure

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
not sure because we have still pressure

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.199 
not sure because we have still pressure
you<00:03:30.900> know<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.200> it's<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.400> bit<00:03:32.549> strange
