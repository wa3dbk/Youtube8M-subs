00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
there's room for a small battery

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.089 
there's room for a small battery
potentially<00:00:29.099> eventually<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.890> there<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.980> is

came<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> little<00:00:41.129> piece<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> paper<00:00:42.030> said

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
came with a little piece of paper said

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.000 
came with a little piece of paper said
it<00:00:42.480> needs<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.870> 10<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> 12<00:00:43.469> hours<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.739> break-in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it needs like 10 to 12 hours a break-in

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.639 
it needs like 10 to 12 hours a break-in
period<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.480> whatnot<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.840> imma<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> easy

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
period and whatnot so imma take it easy

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
period and whatnot so imma take it easy
on<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> slowly<00:00:47.579> breaking<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> properly<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
on it and slowly breaking it properly so

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
on it and slowly breaking it properly so
when<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> does<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.680> fully<00:00:49.980> broken<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.370> thinks

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
when it does get fully broken it thinks

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.860 
when it does get fully broken it thinks
a<00:00:50.730> slam<00:00:51.800> like<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:52.920> trunk<00:00:54.739> but<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:56.600> here's<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a slam like my trunk but um here's the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.740 
a slam like my trunk but um here's the
app<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.199> running<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.750> then

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
app I'm running it on right now then

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
app I'm running it on right now then

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
box right there but um I'm getting a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
box right there but um I'm getting a
sound<00:01:09.869> stream<00:01:10.110> detail<00:01:10.590> ramp<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.970> does<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
sound stream detail ramp that does not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.440 
sound stream detail ramp that does not
hear<00:01:12.540> what's<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:13.530> mess<00:01:14.159> atoms<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.270> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
hear what's our mess atoms which this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.030 
hear what's our mess atoms which this
thing<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> multimeter<00:01:16.320> dit<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.890> actually

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thing I multimeter dit and it's actually

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.020 
thing I multimeter dit and it's actually
running<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:17.670> 1.8<00:01:18.390> mm<00:01:18.570> 1.7<00:01:19.350> ohms<00:01:20.030> unlike

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
running at about 1.8 mm 1.7 ohms unlike

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.359 
running at about 1.8 mm 1.7 ohms unlike
my<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.210> sub<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:22.140> wire<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:23.100> running

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
my other sub when wire down is running

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.390 
my other sub when wire down is running
like<00:01:23.490> 2.2<00:01:23.970> own<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.590> that's<00:01:25.590> pretty<00:01:25.770> good<00:01:25.979> it's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like 2.2 own so that's pretty good it's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
like 2.2 own so that's pretty good it's
running<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:26.909> lower<00:01:27.090> than<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.689> know

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
running a little lower than I you know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
running a little lower than I you know
I'd<00:01:28.020> rather<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.439> 1.8<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> 2.2<00:01:29.549> homes<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> they

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
I'd rather be 1.8 and 2.2 homes and they

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
I'd rather be 1.8 and 2.2 homes and they
went<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.259> finally<00:01:31.560> wires<00:01:31.799> down<00:01:32.040> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
went you know finally wires down but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700 
went you know finally wires down but
right<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.930> plenty<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
right here if you see I got plenty of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
right here if you see I got plenty of
space<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.479> what's<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.049> my

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
space and there what's that's for my

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
space and there what's that's for my
foot<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> detail<00:01:37.740> ramp<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> stands

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
foot the detail ramp because it stands

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.929 
foot the detail ramp because it stands
up<00:01:39.090> vertically<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.670> there

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
up vertically so this will be back there

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.940 
up vertically so this will be back there
and<00:01:42.869> I'll<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.530> son<00:01:43.770> close

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and I'll have that back there son close

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.270 
and I'll have that back there son close
the<00:01:44.070> seat<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.939> closed<00:01:45.299> off

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the seat up and have it all closed off

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
the seat up and have it all closed off
get<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> faucet<00:01:47.759> cable<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:49.110> thing's<00:01:49.259> will

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
