00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
minecart let's get these out of here put

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:10.260 
minecart let's get these out of here put
the<00:05:09.879> car<00:05:10.059> down

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
the car down

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.299 
the car down
and<00:05:11.580> boop-boop<00:05:12.960> yeah<00:05:13.960> that's<00:05:14.469> right<00:05:14.770> GTA

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:15.309
