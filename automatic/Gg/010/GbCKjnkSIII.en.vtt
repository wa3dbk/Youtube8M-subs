00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
the right direction so I think this is a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.940 
the right direction so I think this is a
great<00:02:35.550> pickup<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.450> he<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.810> make<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.020> team<00:02:37.350> for

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
great pickup if he can make the team for

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:48.680 
great pickup if he can make the team for
the<00:02:38.100> Broncos<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:46.610> give<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> Broncos<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> b-minus

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the Broncos I give the Broncos a b-minus

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.630 
the Broncos I give the Broncos a b-minus
and<00:02:48.840> what<00:02:48.960> helped<00:02:49.200> us<00:02:49.320> greyed<00:02:49.650> out<00:02:49.680> was<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and what helped us greyed out was the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.400 
and what helped us greyed out was the
undrafted<00:02:51.060> free<00:02:51.450> agents<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:51.990> three<00:02:52.260> guys

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
undrafted free agents all three guys

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.690 
undrafted free agents all three guys
that<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.800> were<00:02:52.890> able<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.190> pick<00:02:53.340> up<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.520> I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
highlighted in this package I think our

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.770 
highlighted in this package I think our
guys<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.700> make<00:02:56.910> an<00:02:57.060> impact<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.510> this

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
guys that can make an impact for this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.120 
guys that can make an impact for this
team<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.110> should<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.350> been<00:02:58.410> drafted<00:02:58.920> within

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
team and should have been drafted within

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.620 
team and should have been drafted within
the<00:02:59.220> seven<00:02:59.520> rounds<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.150> willing<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> give

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the seven rounds so I'm willing to give

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.450 
the seven rounds so I'm willing to give
them<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.900> break<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.410> Brock<00:03:01.740> Osweiler<00:03:01.950> pick

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
them a break for the Brock Osweiler pick

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.430 
them a break for the Brock Osweiler pick
that<00:03:02.610> they're<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:02.880> wolf<00:03:03.060> pic<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:04.050> i<00:03:04.080> think<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
that they're at wolf pic so i think the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.990 
that they're at wolf pic so i think the
broncos<00:03:04.830> are<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.070> team<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.640> has<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.790> lot<00:03:05.940> of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
broncos are a team that has a lot of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
broncos are a team that has a lot of
talent<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:06.510> really<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:06.990> lot<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.230> holes

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
talent they really have a lot of holes

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.530 
talent they really have a lot of holes
so<00:03:07.920> those<00:03:08.280> three<00:03:08.580> undrafted<00:03:08.970> free<00:03:09.270> agents

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so those three undrafted free agents

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.880 
so those three undrafted free agents
would<00:03:09.600> help<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.200> grade<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.770> see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
would help out this grade so you can see

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.160 
would help out this grade so you can see
the<00:03:10.980> Broncos<00:03:11.340> back<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> playoffs<00:03:12.300> in<00:03:12.420> 2012
