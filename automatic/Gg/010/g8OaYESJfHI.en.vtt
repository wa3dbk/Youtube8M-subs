00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.680
 with club friends, well, judo and 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'm going to show you how to install what 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.210
 they are a good textures pack I already have 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.520
 a video in this on my channel a lot jazz 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.560
 where to know about how to install them but 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.390
 Well, many questions came up 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.400
 many problems if you can and I'm going to 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.080
 try to fix all that here or 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 clarify your doubts more than anything so 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.259
 Well, good to start, let's go 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.329
 this application called pocket or 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.419
 totally free on the beach I'm there 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.369
 the download and then we're going to enter a 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.630
 texture pack this where they are downloaded 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.980
 good from the internet can look in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.870
 Internet 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.460
 or good on my channel and right now I'm going to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.290
 start going up from now 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.000
 also this video so they can search 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.329
 if I already have some packages and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.670
 download now as good when 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.790
 download they have to save it in a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 special folder that is the folder of 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.000
 download is in that folder I do not know if 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 is that every device is 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.269
 modified differently good in 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 my phone the folders keep them 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.379
 automatically on the external one but 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.720
 I have seen that the majority is memory 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.399
 internal, so it depends on you 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.200
 which will keep your other files of 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.180
 download automatically as you see in the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.119
 mine then in the external memory so 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.869
 well here is all the folders and if 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.750
 you keep them in memory 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.700
 internally there they keep the map but in 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.500
 the download folder is in the folder 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 that automatically all downloads 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.570
 there they go if they have not modified it well 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.670
 said this because I think he took some 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.200
 doubt also good first thing to do 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 is to have the texture post and have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.130
 this application now how the install is installed 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.649
 texture pack has to come in point 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.289
 yes and within that zip point must of 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.790
 come a folder and then well no no 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.160
 unzip or nothing alone 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.650
 let's make the file like that and we're going here 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.290
 one says being in the content and then 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.330
 in textures from there we're going to look for the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.770
 texture pack that we want to install in 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.840
 this case I'm going to install the docu 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.820
 kraft is this that is here as you see 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.220
 this zip point is not uncompressed and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.570
 nothing so they have to install let's go 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.520
 hold down what is the pack of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.829
 texture and then we have it installed 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.439
 Then he tells us that he is meat 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.269
 that is installed and now we have 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.990
 to go back and then give it in everything 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.020
 the kit 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 the skin sectors and we will flip the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.990
 screen and then we'll have to look for the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.630
 texture pack that we just installed 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.580
 that is this we would only have pressed 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.950
 we will keep pressed that we just 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.150
 install the one we want to install and you 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.860
 we give in use texture 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.379
 the first part we did install 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.540
 the skin was for the texture was for 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.829
 install it in the application the step that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.439
 just done is to install it in 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.040
 the game once already having it installed 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:45.319
 we will give menu and pichincha now 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.079
 this will cause us as in the change 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.849
 of the skin uninstall minecraft and 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.409
 reinstall it is this is a step 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.359
 we automatically have to do it to 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.040
 forces that's the first point of 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.579
 second does not erase maps does not erase you 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.930
 nothing if you erase something is because then you 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.450
 you moved something more and if I have a 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.129
 wrong step or things like that or if there is nothing 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.200
 of that is because all devices 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.730
 android is with different room 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.440
 different 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.389
 Android is modified in a way 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.010
 different so then the apps 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.230
 they do not work the same way in all 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.480
 the phones do not worry if you want 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.549
 you can do one with a backup to your 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.590
 the game folder that is where they come from 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.970
 the maps of minecraft and so you do not lose 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.580
 your maps in case something happens 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.840
 if you mike the then you work, I did not open 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.180
 all that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.430
 all they have to do is then 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.870
 more than anything uninstall it completely 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.090
 test install in pure minecraft 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.830
 application and just reinstall it 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.170
 if they have it paid and you can not 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.510
 reinstall then they can look for one 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.299
 free of the same chingadera and good 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.459
 as far as I know has not even 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.900
 affected none only one told me 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.519
 but he never told me why or why 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.860
 what happened to him so he can not help 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.540
 so it's good enough to talk hello 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.209
 we will have to stay latina pete chains 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.120
 and we will have to wait as it says and here 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.650
 let's wait 30 to 60 seconds to 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.060
 to load the texture pack in what 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.670
 start doing all your movements 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.900
 right now it's going to look like a screen 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.549
 uninstall minecraft and we're going to 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.549
 give to accept so we wait 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.459
 and what I expected 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.740
 in fear of taking a little longer because 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.600
 I'm recording and that's how it does 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.030
 a little slow these processes but good 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.770
 As you can see short video no nothing all 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.900
 perfectly not for anything else 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.510
 if something went wrong, why not even 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.670
 I would do as you see now says you want 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.320
 uninstall this application we give to 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.849
 accept automatically desist 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.129
 Minecraft 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.189
 no maps are lost or nothing is returned 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.189
 to repeat 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.319
 after this he will tell us again 

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:53.639
 install the healthy ones you want to go back to 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.889
 install this is to install it already 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.889
 with the texture we give to install 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.729
 good we hope 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.590
 and once finished we have finished 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.930
 we left the application and the only thing 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.460
 we need to do is check that it has 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.730
 installed everything alright so we opened the 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.730
 Minecraft 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.380
 but we also open the minecraft 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.800
 and as they see and change until the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.450
 menu and in return also texture not what 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.450
 we look for what is a map 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.230
 and as you see 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.870
 then in return the whole texture pack 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.650
 so I hope you liked it 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.010
 friends is a is an easy procedure and 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.440
 simple 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.030
 then they got used to him so 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.800
 I hope you liked it so we 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.330
 we see until next time I hope they do not have 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.330
 no problem with this bye
