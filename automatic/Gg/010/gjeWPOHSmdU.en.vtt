you'll notice right we'll be able to see
on<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.180> video<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:54.190> our<00:02:54.459> plunger<00:02:54.790> here<00:02:55.300> is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
on this video but our plunger here is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.550 
on this video but our plunger here is
not<00:02:56.470> rotating<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:58.300> stays<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.170> way<00:02:59.410> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
not rotating it stays so that way it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.400 
not rotating it stays so that way it
doesn't<00:02:59.770> put<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.489> add<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> torque<00:03:01.269> on<00:03:01.510> your
