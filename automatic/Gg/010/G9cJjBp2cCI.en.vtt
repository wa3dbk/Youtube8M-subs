ahead and run the wires from front to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.730 
ahead and run the wires from front to
rear<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.300> 4-pole<00:00:12.780> flat<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.650> we're

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
rear with the 4-pole flat and we're

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.470 
rear with the 4-pole flat and we're
gonna<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:13.950> using<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.340> big<00:00:14.610> loop<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.360> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
gonna be using the big loop for that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.039 
gonna be using the big loop for that

just going to chop off one end and run
that<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> back<00:00:21.500> okay<00:00:22.500> we're<00:00:22.619> gonna<00:00:22.710> start

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
that to the back okay we're gonna start

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910 
that to the back okay we're gonna start
off<00:00:23.160> by<00:00:23.400> attaching<00:00:24.090> our<00:00:24.510> wire<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.740> base

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
off by attaching our wire to the base

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.429 
off by attaching our wire to the base
plate<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> vehicle<00:00:26.730> itself<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:28.230> will

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
plate of the vehicle itself and will

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.650 
plate of the vehicle itself and will
allow<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:28.890> extra<00:00:29.760> length<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.300> in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
allow for some extra length there in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.910 
allow for some extra length there in
case<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> change<00:00:31.500> over<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
case you want to change over to a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
case you want to change over to a
different<00:00:32.099> type<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> connector<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.719> let's<00:00:33.899> dip

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
different type of connector so let's dip

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
different type of connector so let's dip
tie<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.350> off<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> work<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> towards<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
tie that off and work it towards the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
tie that off and work it towards the
back<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> vehicle<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.440> run<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
back of the vehicle when we run into the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.260 
back of the vehicle when we run into the
back<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.250> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> make<00:00:38.550> sure<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.059> stay

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
back we want to make sure that we stay

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.250 
back we want to make sure that we stay
away<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.450> anything<00:00:39.780> moving<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
away from anything moving like a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
away from anything moving like a
suspension<00:00:40.920> or<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.879> hot<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
suspension or I think it's hot like the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.959 
suspension or I think it's hot like the
exhaust<00:00:43.129> everybody<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.250> under<00:00:44.550> wires

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
exhaust everybody we're under wires

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.040 
exhaust everybody we're under wires
different<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.570> those<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
different way but those are the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.160 
different way but those are the
guidelines<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.649> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:48.170> either

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
guidelines you want to go by either

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
guidelines you want to go by either
runner<00:00:49.440> wires<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> inside<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.309> body<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
runner wires to the inside of body to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
runner wires to the inside of body to
get<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.329> wire<00:00:51.480> Finers<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.110> basically

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
get to our wire Finers so basically

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560 
get to our wire Finers so basically
we're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.059> corner<00:00:54.449> right

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we're going to do at this corner right

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.610 
we're going to do at this corner right
here<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> sheet<00:00:55.320> metal

a previous install this is gonna be your
in<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> spot<00:01:34.050> where<00:01:34.080> we're<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> install

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
in a spot where we're going to install

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.620 
in a spot where we're going to install
our<00:01:34.890> diodes<00:01:35.399> what<00:01:36.119> we're<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.330> do<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.600> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
our diodes what we're gonna do is just

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.270 
our diodes what we're gonna do is just
simply<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.649> move<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> wire

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
simply take this and move it up the wire

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
simply take this and move it up the wire
a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.000> already<00:01:39.270> tested<00:01:39.420> our<00:01:39.720> wire

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
a little bit we already tested our wire

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.270 
a little bit we already tested our wire
harness<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> green<00:01:41.100> wire

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
harness so we know that the green wire

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.980 
harness so we know that the green wire
is<00:01:41.580> gonna<00:01:41.910> be<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.149> turn<00:01:42.390> signal<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.899> brake

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
is gonna be a turn signal and brake

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.920 
is gonna be a turn signal and brake
signal<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.610> brown<00:01:45.030> wire<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.750> be

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
signal and the brown wire is going to be

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
signal and the brown wire is going to be
for<00:01:46.229> running<00:01:46.440> light<00:01:46.560> circuit<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.520> our<00:01:47.700> wire

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
for running light circuit and our wire

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.950 
for running light circuit and our wire
hearts<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.270> ran<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.660> front

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
hearts are they ran from the front

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
hearts are they ran from the front
basically<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> color<00:01:50.430> for

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
basically it's going to be color for

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.400 
basically it's going to be color for
color<00:01:50.729> greens<00:01:51.509> gonna<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.960> turn<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
color greens gonna be a right turn and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.170 
color greens gonna be a right turn and
brake<00:01:53.040> signal<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.580> Browns<00:01:53.880> gonna<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
brake signal and Browns gonna be a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.960 
brake signal and Browns gonna be a

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.910 
running light we'll start with the right
turn<00:01:57.180> signal<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.720> brick<00:01:58.289> we're<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.649> cut<00:01:58.830> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
turn signal and brick we're just cut the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.710 
turn signal and brick we're just cut the
wire<00:01:59.039> in<00:01:59.190> half<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.000> strip<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.300> wires<00:02:00.450> back

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
wire in half and strip the wires back

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.249 
wire in half and strip the wires back
and<00:02:00.960> add<00:02:01.050> our<00:02:01.170> terminals<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> each<00:02:01.979> side

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.419 

now<00:02:07.259> let's<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.590> ahead<00:02:07.709> and<00:02:07.830> take<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> green<00:02:08.250> wire

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
now let's go ahead and take a green wire

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.870 
now let's go ahead and take a green wire
and<00:02:08.840> separate<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.200> wire<00:02:10.380> harness

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
and separate it from the wire harness

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.100 
and separate it from the wire harness
all<00:02:11.880> right<00:02:11.970> we'll<00:02:12.120> cut<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> wire<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.600> half<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
all right we'll cut a wire in half and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.520 
all right we'll cut a wire in half and
add<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> terminal<00:02:13.680> from<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> water<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> can

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
add a terminal from the water now I can

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.380 
add a terminal from the water now I can
add<00:02:16.680> our<00:02:16.830> diode<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.880> see<00:02:17.970> what<00:02:18.090> diode

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
add our diode now you can see what diode

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.530 
add our diode now you can see what diode
is<00:02:18.510> labeled<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.740> out<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.520> inputs<00:02:21.000> will<00:02:21.420> be

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
is labeled in and out the inputs will be

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.530 
is labeled in and out the inputs will be
from<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> vehicle<00:02:22.740> itself

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
from the vehicle itself

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.300 
from the vehicle itself
we'll<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.750> slide<00:02:24.990> one<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
we'll go and slide one on and then the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.339 
we'll go and slide one on and then the
other<00:02:26.490> input<00:02:26.910> would<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.480> 4-pole

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
other input would be from the 4-pole

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.589 
other input would be from the 4-pole
that<00:02:28.470> ran<00:02:28.620> from<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> front<00:02:29.330> okay<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.510> then

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
that ran from the front okay and then

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.930 
that ran from the front okay and then
our<00:02:30.690> output<00:02:31.080> always<00:02:31.620> goes<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
our output always goes out to the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.960 
our output always goes out to the
taillight<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.750> we'll<00:02:33.900> slip<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.380> there

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
taillight so we'll slip that in there

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.820 
taillight so we'll slip that in there
okay<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:37.110> turn<00:02:37.319> signal<00:02:37.349> and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
okay so we have a right turn signal and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.350 
okay so we have a right turn signal and
brake<00:02:37.920> done<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:38.760> we'll<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.000> over<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
brake done now we'll go over to the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.120 
brake done now we'll go over to the
running<00:02:39.599> light<00:02:39.780> circuit<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.770> gonna<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
running light circuit it's gonna be the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.309 
running light circuit it's gonna be the
same<00:02:41.340> thing<00:02:41.400> however<00:02:42.180> we're<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.050> make<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
same thing however we're going to make a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.809 
same thing however we're going to make a
little<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> junction<00:02:43.920> will<00:02:44.069> still<00:02:44.310> add<00:02:44.670> our

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
little the junction will still add our

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.160 
little the junction will still add our
diode<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.300> before<00:02:45.599> but<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:45.930> we're<00:02:46.050> gonna

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
diode like before but then we're gonna

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.949 
diode like before but then we're gonna
run<00:02:46.560> these<00:02:47.010> two<00:02:47.280> together<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.720> add<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
run these two together then add a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.960 
run these two together then add a
terminal<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.590> both<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.950> those<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
terminal to both of those and that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
terminal to both of those and that
provide<00:02:51.270> our<00:02:51.480> junction<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:52.709> we'll<00:02:52.830> have<00:02:52.950> power

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
provide our junction so we'll have power

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.520 
provide our junction so we'll have power
for<00:02:53.520> running<00:02:54.480> lights<00:02:54.660> going<00:02:54.930> into<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.290> diode

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
for running lights going into this diode

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.670 
for running lights going into this diode
and<00:02:55.860> over<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.450> side

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
and over to the one on the other side

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.090 
and over to the one on the other side
let's<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.830> ahead<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.069> add<00:02:59.160> our<00:02:59.190> diode

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.080 

one<00:03:04.100> other<00:03:04.160> thing<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.460> got<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.610> deal<00:03:04.820> with<00:03:04.940> is

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
one other thing we got to deal with is

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.490 
one other thing we got to deal with is
our<00:03:05.240> ground<00:03:05.450> wire<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:05.870> haven't<00:03:06.110> attached<00:03:06.350> a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
our ground wire we haven't attached a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.990 
our ground wire we haven't attached a
ground<00:03:06.770> yet<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.460> there's<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.670> nice<00:03:07.790> piece<00:03:07.970> of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
ground yet and there's a nice piece of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.090 
ground yet and there's a nice piece of
sheet<00:03:08.270> metal<00:03:08.390> right<00:03:08.570> here<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.860> we'll<00:03:09.950> let's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100

and run it straight to the bodywork next
we're<00:03:25.070> gonna<00:03:25.160> do<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.340> run<00:03:25.460> our<00:03:25.610> wire<00:03:25.760> across<00:03:26.330> so

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
we're gonna do is run our wire across so

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.680 
we're gonna do is run our wire across so
we're<00:03:27.020> going<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.200> take<00:03:27.290> out<00:03:27.440> our<00:03:27.640> liner<00:03:28.690> put

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
we're going to take out our liner put
