 VKontakte basic rules will be 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 About the following want to type as 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.370
 air force 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.160
 shake the old days and make you 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.040
 go on the stretch ah well or 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 something that damasks and tanks give 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.360
 There can be many Fri-shki include such 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.060
 there is something there and 3 or something 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 such 95 then God forbid in general 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 Like that that is, we are going to collect 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.759
 will replay which attention played 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.460
 patch 097 all other past almost not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.710
 accepted in general never and these replays 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 must contain a fight where you on 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.640
 interpreted that is from beating their 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.250
 own armor and inflicted 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.470
 impressive epic large number 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.079
 damage since participants surely 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.939
 there will be many and willing too, then 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.799
 sure so easy there with four 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.700
 Thousands of damage and two thousand miles 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.799
 from broken 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.070
 don't even send such a replay 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.799
 it is required where quite an epic number to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.490
 example on the fourth if it is there 9 thousand 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.700
 inflicted 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.950
 4 for example beat off such replay I 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.149
 I think they will have chances to win with 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 other side I want to warn you 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.439
 so that there are no such battles where stupid 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 going out on the mouse getting on 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.820
 a robin near the hangar you put out 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.640
 only there the board at an angle you fill from 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.250
 Broken thousand 20 is certainly not 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.430
 is spectacular, we will not look in 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.439
 ultimately 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.049
 to get these replays that 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.959
 are taken on all of them except cash and 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.819
 non-monetary gold and such material 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.769
 prizes which we will talk about them 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.260
 for all I will do for these battles in the end 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.689
 video voiced their manner 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.819
 as you used to once subscribed to my 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.040
 channel and we all see these fights 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.099
 i.e. here they are ranked ok 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 by interestingness that is, the numbers themselves by 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.200
 imagine this is not all the numbers are conditions well 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 let's say I'm interested and will look 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.090
 your fight to put it but if the fight itself at 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 this is interesting with any there 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.599
 suffering 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.480
 some overwhelming feelings 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.519
 with a demonstration of skill and skill then he 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.980
 It will have the highest chance of 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.230
 victory besides getting into tv what 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.599
 already in itself not bad but it's like 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.879
 thank you in your pocket will not put course 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.650
 players will also receive from the official 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.469
 group of world of tanks vkontakte 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.169
 impressive prize in the form of game gold 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.000
 as many as 3000 to each winner of all 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.430
 it turns out 15 cool friends yes we have 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.790

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.829
 traditionally and from nvidia harvested too 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.919
 good prizes that everyone will be on 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.409
 joy let's say the first three places are 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.120
 the most interesting in my opinion fights 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.079
 the most so straight which 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.989
 pleasure to watch 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.389
 they will be awarded the most important prizes 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.400
 I will say little more while it will be a surprise 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.720
 some will be prizes for the fair 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.909
 just not until the end of the match 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.400
 agreed some will be prizes but 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.430
 sure everyone will want them 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.099
 get the rest of the guys from 4 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.739
 and 15th place including a prize from 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.590
 religion will be such a cool disk 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.680
 hard drive it will be quiet but by type 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.229
 big flash drive and a half byte a little 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.049
 moreover, they still need to be branded 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:04.509
 armored symbols of my channel well 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.620
 honestly even for me it is special 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.299
 joy may not be so much for 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.669
 winners but nevertheless thats 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.169
 great memento that will 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.729
 not ashamed and is married to a friend 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.379
 show boast well and in general 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.959
 Generally one more important 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.539
 the condition they are for some reason not always 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.910
 this is pleased to have to participate in 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.190
 contest you need 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.510
 i'm a have a vkontakte account many 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.550
 people just prefer not at all 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.770
 Get yourself a social network not to bathe on 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.890
 this bill but nevertheless to collect 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.200
 replays and generally in general to participate for 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.810
 conducting this competition and tracking 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.610
 totals it is very important this name simplifies 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.590
 work because the most convenient as me 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.570
 it seems a place where everyone can 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.390
 absolutely gather the more so the group 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.880
 which I have there about 150 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.950
 thousand people have not looked at the type 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.540
 that is, it is very convenient to understand 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.150
 correct if you have vkontakte accounts 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.730
 no get the left most important to 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.370
 your first and last name were yours 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.350
 because it will be through VKontakte 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.050
 contact winners in friend 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.760
 it's very important plus everything else 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.590
 sharp check to make sure that 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.930
 man who played the fight 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.460
 that is, the one who replay eventually filled not 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.250
 necessarily thick replay goals 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.220
 to the person who played the fight and the one who 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.310
 he was sent to the contest was the same 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.140
 the same person is also very important 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.180
 get ready to call your mobile 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.870
 phone when it comes to determining 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.060
 winners 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.310
 It is important for courier service which 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.410
 will deliver you a prize from invidia to me 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.140
 personally, your phone does not need to use 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.480
 they are not as otherwise just for 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.360
 courier service and according to the results of the competition 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.600

 jumping on with the points where you do 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.580
 tank antigenic position as king 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.100
 stuff damage and are very useful for 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.950
