Richardson managed to get people from
these<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.030> very<00:00:45.420> separate<00:00:46.170> areas<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
these so very separate areas of

existence to operate as one that's a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.580 
existence to operate as one that's a
tremendous<00:00:50.820> ability<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.930> maybe<00:00:52.199> something

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
tremendous ability and maybe something

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.170

that's play floating villages should be

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.260 
that's play floating villages should be
extremely<00:00:54.809> proud<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.620> brought<00:00:55.890> those

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
extremely proud of to have brought those

separate people together to be the world

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.099 
separate people together to be the world
for<00:00:59.340> quite<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.520> long<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.699> under<00:01:00.690> those

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
for quite a long time under those

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.479 
for quite a long time under those
capsules<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.620> didn't<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.309> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the loss to Australia by one so it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
the loss to Australia by one so it
wasn't<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:06.119> him<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.540> Kerry<00:01:06.780> Packer

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
wasn't just him I think Kerry Packer

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that packer and weight were actually

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
that packer and weight were actually
just<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.979> important<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.520> Lord<00:01:20.759> enriches<00:01:21.290> for

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
just as important as Lord enriches for

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
just as important as Lord enriches for
me<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.680> wasn't<00:01:23.040> until<00:01:23.340> after<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.939> defeat<00:01:24.119> in

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
me it wasn't until after that defeat in

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.569 
me it wasn't until after that defeat in
7576<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.890> serious<00:01:26.790> real<00:01:27.509> serious<00:01:28.020> attention

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
7576 that serious real serious attention

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
7576 that serious real serious attention
was<00:01:29.579> put<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.329> were<00:01:30.420> doing<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.960> think

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
was put into what we were doing I think

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
was put into what we were doing I think
we<00:01:31.740> grew<00:01:32.100> into<00:01:32.490> understanding<00:01:33.420> our<00:01:33.570> own

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
we grew into understanding our own

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.310 
we grew into understanding our own
abilities<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.640> grew<00:01:35.880> into

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
abilities I think we grew into

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
abilities I think we grew into
recognizing<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.650> part<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.909> poor

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
recognizing your part and your poor

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.349 
recognizing your part and your poor
the<00:01:39.630> T<00:01:39.899> in<00:01:40.289> 60s<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.310> early<00:01:41.490> 70s<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:42.090> wasn't

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
the T in 60s and early 70s there wasn't

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.149 
the T in 60s and early 70s there wasn't
many<00:01:42.509> years<00:01:42.780> where<00:01:43.469> many<00:01:43.619> fast<00:01:43.829> phone<00:01:44.039> was

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
many years where many fast phone was

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.569 
many years where many fast phone was
around

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
around

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.279 
around
so<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:44.969> Lillian<00:01:45.390> Thompson's<00:01:45.840> Australian

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
so when Lillian Thompson's Australian

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.169 
so when Lillian Thompson's Australian
and<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.799> came<00:01:47.039> along<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.640> shock

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
and this lot came along it was a shock

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.609 
and this lot came along it was a shock
if<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> whole<00:01:48.929> system<00:01:49.289> of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
if you like to the whole system of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.169 
if you like to the whole system of
triggered<00:01:50.219> figures<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.149> people

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
triggered figures that people

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.669 
triggered figures that people
technically<00:01:51.960> weren't<00:01:52.170> used<00:01:52.319> to<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
technically weren't used to it

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.649 
technically weren't used to it
and<00:01:53.039> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.429> took<00:01:53.549> batsman<00:01:54.000> ten<00:01:54.210> years<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and I think it took batsman ten years to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
and I think it took batsman ten years to
get<00:01:54.840> used<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.289> new<00:01:55.439> rules<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.100> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
get used to the new rules if you like so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.999 
get used to the new rules if you like so
