or<00:00:58.079> anything<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:58.980> i<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.160> tell<00:00:59.280> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
or anything but from what i can tell it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.520 
or anything but from what i can tell it
was<00:01:00.210> comfortable<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> felt<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.260> like

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
was comfortable when it felt just like

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
was comfortable when it felt just like
using<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> normal<00:01:02.100> paintbrush<00:01:02.670> i<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
using a normal paintbrush i think it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.939 
using a normal paintbrush i think it
works<00:01:03.600> very<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.170> i<00:01:04.260> had<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.439> issues

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
works very well and i had no issues

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.980 
works very well and i had no issues
using<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.030> feel<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.510> someone<00:01:06.840> was

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
using it and I feel like if someone was

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
using it and I feel like if someone was
pretty<00:01:07.229> serious<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:07.890> their<00:01:08.040> digital<00:01:08.430> art

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
pretty serious about their digital art

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
pretty serious about their digital art
this<00:01:09.090> stylus<00:01:09.570> tip<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:09.900> work<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.409> for

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
this stylus tip would work very well for

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.280 
this stylus tip would work very well for
them<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.430> by<00:01:11.610> itself<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> stylus<00:01:12.570> tip<00:01:12.780> costs

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
them now by itself the stylus tip costs

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
them now by itself the stylus tip costs
around<00:01:13.439> fifteen<00:01:13.860> dollars<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> comes<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
around fifteen dollars and it comes with

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
around fifteen dollars and it comes with
the<00:01:15.000> case<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.140> might<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the case and I think this might be a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
the case and I think this might be a
little<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:16.890> too<00:01:17.100> much<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> stylus

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
little bit too much for just the stylus

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
little bit too much for just the stylus
tip<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> included<00:01:19.500> case<00:01:19.680> helps<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> little

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
tip but the included case helps a little

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
tip but the included case helps a little
bit<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> buy<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> combo<00:01:21.750> deal<00:01:21.930> on
