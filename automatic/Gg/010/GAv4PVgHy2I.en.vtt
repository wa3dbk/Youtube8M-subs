00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.710
 they remove mum from bales enough 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.090
 hot because the neighbor wakes up at 8 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.009
 yes yes I haven't bought this month 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 no book the fact is that I do not have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 loaded the card on purpose because 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.690
 I have to make a birthday present at 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.730
 on 2 March 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.320
 I was saying March 3 but he would have killed 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.420
 after saying to start with the speaker 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.860
 king books even if I am a person 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 horrible so this month I read 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 only five or six books anyway 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.010
 I found something interesting there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.170
 same 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 for those who do not know it in this section 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.309
 I talk about the books I found 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.870
 interesting than ever way to get into 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 in a positive way in the negative way of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 so that you can choose yourself if 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.120
 light or not, that is, it is clear that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.189
 you choose the same despite the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 my reviews, however, you have understood that is 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.240
 today he can not speak is the fifth or sixth 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.530
 time I'm trying to do this again 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.090
 video anyway a couple of little things 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.920
 interesting I found them first among 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.060
 all letter to a child never born of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.159
 oriana fallaci who kindly gave me 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.570
 loaned my neighbor bye next or later 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.759
 still new to the fallaci but I have not 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 read if you come from Mars and not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.600
 know who is fallacious or what oriana 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.100
 speak letter tomorrow appointed speak 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 essentially of a letter to a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 child never born saura of obviousness 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 part 2 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.200
 no oh well jokes aside the woman there 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.600
 presents itself has no name and only one 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.880
 epistolary novel intended precisely to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.530
 this child spoiler in the title 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.420
 this novel will never be born 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.549
 who does not love epistolary novels because 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.060
 being a unique letter in my opinion is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.790
 rather useful or beyond 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 I said that in my opinion it is useful because if 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.340
 a single letter even if it is 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.689
 an epistolary novel does not give 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.159
 particularly annoying me usually 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.710
 Roman of solar from a proper sui 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.299
 nerves advised against those who do not love the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.860
 unbroken stream of consciousness because 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.060
 obviously being a letter to a 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.679
 baby never born and therefore having to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.440
 decide whether to abort or not yes 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:15.780
 This is a very controversial novel 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.569
 contradictory the lap key or not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.850
 healthy of some can talk about 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:28.370
 some if you use china you will have one 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.930
 surprise that is oh my god 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.500
 the doctor all the others 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.519
 I know I know the doctor monia must 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.070
 touch hat than in version 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.170
 of course, but the dragon ball 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.569
 looks like a lot that is actually fat 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.829
 I have n't read it here I don't remember anymore 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.540

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.500

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.370
 mori said kilt reads like the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.470
 skirt in kit and is a collection 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.630
 of stories focused mostly on 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.370
 children not a prodigy however like le 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.810

 the offers I found around 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.050
