00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.960
 be all welcome to the first 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 edition of interviews for European today 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.330
 We are going to interview several projects 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 that are usually called cheaters 11 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 hackers on public servants and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.480
 basically they are players that in order to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.849
 accounts are only good very good 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.710
 for which we ask for your perspective 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.449
 regarding battlefield and what would be 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 the tips that they could be 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.630
 give the most common players we 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 we leave for the interview until the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.129
 next 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.390
 hello that such first of all a greeting 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.820
 to all the players debates and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.829
 Latin America then look answering what 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.449
 what are you asking me look at that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 question of each one if it is true that 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.670
 there are many puppet players over 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 phil 3 as well as there are players that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.890
 they are very good I consider everything 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.589
 is in question of practicing and not being 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.239
 one more of the bunch of those characters 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.829
 who are out there paying for programs 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.789
 believing that it does good to the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.789
 filtering community 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.300
 Well, I hope I have the egg as 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.860
 that can be pour the most with 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.710
 all the models games that you have of 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.600
 Filters and that we can all improve in 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.840
 self-improvement issue and many 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.289
 hours of practice 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 Look, I think it's excellent, though 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.850
 battlefield 3 was not totally done 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.039
 competitive 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.979
 we all know that electron and skills 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.259
 they have the tools to make the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.549
 3 and 4 the best competitive game not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.130
 both the best but being a game 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.590
 balanced is simply a matter of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.840
 listen to suggestions and contributions 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.569
 that we players at the level of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 competition we need and want to 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.299
 make the debate fill 4 an excellent 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.299
 competitive game 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.469
 look I hope 24 an excellent delivery 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.060
 as it was battlefield 3 that finally 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.390
 you also find the players and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.500
 sport 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.229
 and what and that they devote all the time 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.720
 possible to improve the scope 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.860
 competitive and as I said before and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.020
 we all know that they have the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.100
 tools to make that a 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.160
 excellent game at the level of yes board 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.990
 usually do not bother me let's say the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.540
 we all start with new ones 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.040
 when I started playing when 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.300
 phil 3 looked at those players that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.740
 they finished an 80-90 male without flex and very 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.480
 few deaths in Sana'a 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.270
 this can not be that has to be 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.100
 guys I know but but eventually 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.710
 you're realizing that battlefield is very 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.380
 easy to get through so not the truth 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.580
 it does not bother me at all because I 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.290
 I also went through that moment and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.620
 surely I also called many people 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.620
 hacker 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:59.720
 the best advice I could give you to see 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:03.970
 I think it would be that they have fun in the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.530
 real life and have a good time and in the process 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.110
 they can not do the best 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.540
 bourgeois world 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.370
 they will end up bored very fast 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.550
 of the game they are going to get angry they go to 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.550
 to warm 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.790
 that's 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.280
 yes the truth that I personally 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.200
 would love that other 40 nor sports about 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.150
 all because lately the impulses of 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.920
 schutter are declining very much what 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.800
 which is the competition that puts you 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.840
 think about all the sport leagues that are 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.730
 are concentrating a retention would be 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.950
 great that where the 50 has been oriented to 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 competition and that singles are 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.470
 re-enter this field 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.470
 because they are disappearing 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.250
 what I hope from battlefield 4 good the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.610
 true that he did not wait too much because 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.870
 for what we all see is going to be a 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.480
 remater de vterter filtres let's say the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.780
 the same models are the same 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.730
 graphs same vehicles hopefully it's 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.210
 a better version of the engine and filter 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.820
 who repair all the books the hit 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.680
 box is the one when they kill you behind a 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.300
 wall and good all the bulls and failures 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.370
 that we already know 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.220
 I'd love it good if they give us 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.739
 Support for competition one way 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.380
 viewer maybe and a record material 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.440
 that would be great to fix the 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.450
 suppression that yes can not be the truth 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 it can not be that it's penalizing the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.320
 aim of a good player when the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.060
 enemy fails shot because that's how 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.420
 suppression works so you do not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.680
 you know or the game is helping a 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.660
 player who has less aim than you 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.810
 I do not ask that they be completely removed 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.740
 I think it's something that no game has 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.169
 that start or two but surely have 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.210
 to be the best adapted or maybe 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.340
 that subversion can be disabled 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.330
 with a simple command with a server 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.699
 private while racing may not be 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.740
 well what good beaches have a 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:08.080
 penalty for making a hunt 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.080
 when when a child fails 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.640
 the first thing that comes to mind 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.850
 when someone accuses me of having 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.250
 used of a mosquito or to use 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.260
 Macros is that this kid is missing 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.870
 still learning to play is missing 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.800
 improve this is not doing things 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.710
 well and they accuse you because they think that 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.150
 you are doing something that can not be 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.970
 the game when you can actually 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.010
 quietly doing the game has a 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.150
 lots of tools that you can 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.090
 use in your favor a lot of things and 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.670
 there are people who do not know them then you 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.080
 you say they can be a can be 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.860
 that killed me how can it be that what 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.960
 I have done this way 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.990
 and it's because he does not know then you have to 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.669
 learn to recognize when others play 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.180
 better your voice does not believe you are the best 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.180
 never 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.510
 the best advice I can give to the 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.820
 players who are just starting to play is 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.070
 first do not tell twitter to another 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.380
 john better than you second try 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.550
 learn from these players if it can be 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.550
 watch videos 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.220
 try to learn a little with that 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.820
 they do not spend their time doing full auto with 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.490
 the weapon that they try to learn the way 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.170
 of firing of firing of bursts or 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.200
 depending on where they are 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.540
 target in haiti forever the same 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.600
 that's why I recommend you neither 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.280
 use macros that do not serve the macros 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.620
 what is going to do to you is that never 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.970
 learn to play that always shoots is 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.350
 the same way the weapon and it does not serve you 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.540
 no way 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.700
 also be very attentive to the minimum to 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.730
 use it all the time one more the most 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.900
 important is knowing where you are handcuffed 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.020
 of enemy 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.630
 and use the coverages of the 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.160
 Hedge map is very important 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.160
 always be covered 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.060
 I hope that the field has more than 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:14.240
 phil 4 this is a little more potent 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:17.400
 who read a little more attention to this 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.770
 since in the boat filtres it was not so 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.259
 let's hope there are more teams that 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.110
 join us to compete let's hope that the 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:26.420
 communities to more tournaments 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.080
 Y 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.880
 and well I have faith I have faith that goes to 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.960
 change and that's going to be a little more 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.110
 large with the output of 10 and 4 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.330
 of the loot fil 4 I hope you have many 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.720
 more tools in what is it 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.430
 competitive as a viewer mode by 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.020
 example this one would be good that 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.569
 solve most of the errors that 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.729
 has more than 3 as the cliché head 

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:54.340
 all these things that the players in 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:56.139
 the competitive they use them in their favor and 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.380
 they are things that I should not be in 

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.380
 game
