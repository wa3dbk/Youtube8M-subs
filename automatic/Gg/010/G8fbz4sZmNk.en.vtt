00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 all the rays good lobster with you and today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.859
 there will be another edition of the rubric in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.889
 developing and in it I will try to you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.290
 tell in detail about the successor to the Verbins 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 Windows about Thong or Russian 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 translates as east wind 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.460
 the full name of this device 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.580
 very long intricate himself sayin 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 I'm sure I will say with mistakes you are not enough 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.320
 that will understand and since you could 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.900
 guess cold water is German 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.020
 self-propelled anti-aircraft installation which 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.320
 was produced or rather developed on 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 the base of the middle tank panzerkampfwagen 4 and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 produced July 44 to March 45 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.140
 just did not know exactly 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 how many but there according to different sources from 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 43 to 45 due to su 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.809
 well of course in battles they too 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 have participated 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 but I think you have a law 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.129
 The question is, why bother with Windows? 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.320
 replaced on the island of Windows like camel 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.420
 has four twenty not kind of like 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.939
 better deal with planes 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.799
 here there is such an option that shake 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 millimeter cannon she fired 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 greater distance ie hit 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 air targets could have been on 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 height 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 but on the other side of the same faith, Belinda 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.280
 it seems to be a good density of fire 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.650
 still 4 to 20 millimeters but in general 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.470
 German designers decided all the same 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.200
 replace it but it's okay it's just 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 I think the story should go to 1 mod en 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.640
 tth because you wonder with what 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.490
 parameters it may appear in our 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.619
 the game will start with armor and for convenience I 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.329
 attached a picture for you 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.030
 she's in the video here you can now 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.280
 watch where in detail is painted which 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.670
 did he have a booking shemka 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.369
 by the way from the magazine panzer trucks number 12 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 anti-aircraft guns are described there but not only 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.530
 Ost screws tapestry kugelblitz and in general 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.439
 a lot of interesting stuff and so 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.899
 Corps we accordingly got from 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.509
 Proca 4 and later modifications 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.630
 so frontal reservation is 80 by 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.060
 the sides we have 30 millimeters and 20 behind 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.910
 it seems that this is quite good however 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.960
 here is the body of the tower we really have somehow 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.570
 lightly armored 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.250
 there in a circle only 16 millimeters and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.560
 let there they are located these 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.670
 bronelisty at an angle of 30 degrees but you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.590
 still not enough 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.540
 however this one would like to make a little 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.820
 remark I mean by booking 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 towers it is clear that the Internet can 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.130
 find a lot of information on booking 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.710
 tank of the second world war however this 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.720
 information may diverge and here 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.300
 for example on the scheme which took from 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.970
 panzer trucks magazine led by 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.460
 Thomas Jens and fila retail indicated here 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.920
 These 16 millimeters and here is for you cyclopia 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.900
 German tanks of World War II under 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.620
 leadership of Peter Chamberlain and here 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.020
 the same hilary doyle indicated for some reason 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 25 and that's who to believe of course hunting to 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.000
 booking our tanks was 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.160
 reliable but there are such cases with 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.880
 the other side if we consider our 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.590
 the machine is booking 16-25 I think 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.890
 will not play a special role as 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.140
 really 1625 there is a difference of 9 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.720
 millimeters is some special good 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.180
 will not bring if of course the stand is not 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.560
 put on a frame in which I am very and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.630
 highly doubt 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.140
 ok sbr they finished let's go now 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.290
 to arming there we have 37 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.600
 millimeter anti-aircraft gun flak 43 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.270
 a set of shells probably will not be the same 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.580
 like the second rank anti-aircraft gun 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.560
 which she is a semi-tracked tractor and 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.450
 in any case, our task will be 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.610
 to fight aircraft 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.460
 the opponent is still music 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 Yes, and probably sometimes hunting to shoot at 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.020
 tanks and kill them then 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.150
 do at least if we don't 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.760
 can punch tank you can shoot at 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.770
 tool to damage it or on the tracks and 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.480
 shoot them down to practice 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.520
 such affairs will have to be close 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.130
 be subject to the enemy and he is likely 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.260
 do not use the opportunity to take advantage 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.510
 this and therefore we can 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.610
 quick kill so here it will be necessary 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.470
 act very carefully what 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.050
 concerns the driving characteristics then i 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.900
 I think they will not change much because 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.600
 replacing the tank turret on the zenith mass 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.130
 tank itself has not changed much and 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.380
 I almost forgot an important thing if 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.260
 compare with twin anti-aircraft gun 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.970
 Now that attacked the caterpillar tractor 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.310
 we have 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.430
 there will be more shells in the cassette there 6 a 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.890
 we have 8 with regard to ammunition then 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.960
 I did not find a consensus I have the same 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.140
 the situation as with the reservation of the tower 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.780
 somewhere written 416 projectile audit 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.000
 spelled thousands of shells anyway i 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.040
 I do not think that she will be there does not know 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.710
 shells 200 what is it really well 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.380
 there will be little other side again with us 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.610
 there is a feature we can recharge on 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.650
 capture points 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.780
 I think it will help us by the way. 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.520
 further planned to rearm 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.590
 mouth screw but that if war is not 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.690
 over and planned there 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.620
 install already 2 thirty seven 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.230
 millimeter cannon flag 43 or flag 44 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.540
 and according to some data it is known that 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.270
 January 45th year was still 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.280
 one prototype produced as two in 2u 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.919
 which was called just 2 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.380
 thirty seven millimeter cannons but here 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.060
 like stats and I finished but where is he 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.610
 will you ask me 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.130
 then here I think the third rank and immediately after 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.960
 Verbine Windows but simply because the island 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.270
 was the successor believe welwyn yes and 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.520
 It was issued to him so to speak for the replacement 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.490
 so the game would be logical far 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.740
 don't put them apart yes of course 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.140
 differences in combat ranking will be but i 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.090
 I think they will not be so big 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.010
 i have that gap won't be there 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.800
 any unit most likely 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.500
 anywhere 03 or 07 just do 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.020
 more so as there is no need for cars 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.060
 themselves are similar to each other and was 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.729
 the same verb Windows with the density of fire 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.380
 more and rate of fire too but with 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.200
 the other side is twenty millimeter 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.360
 shells are not as good as 37 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.910
 millimeter shells state Windows 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.640
 which to Misha rate of fire and 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.090
 the density of fire is also smaller 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.550
 So 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.720
 and I have it all with you as always 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.120
 was mayor 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.040
 I hope you liked the video and sat down 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.380
 you really liked it 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.200
 likes subscribe to the channel 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.890
 be sure to share this video and how 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.240
 usually 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.240
 see you in sight 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.860
 and
