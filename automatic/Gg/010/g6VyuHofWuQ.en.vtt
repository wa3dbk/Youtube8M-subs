when the is not emergency it's in the
latched<00:00:59.460> position<00:00:59.660> if<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.050> an<00:01:01.230> emergency

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
latched position if it was an emergency

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
latched position if it was an emergency
I<00:01:02.039> would<00:01:02.250> put<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.640> into<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> turned<00:01:03.390> position

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I would put it into the turned position

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
I would put it into the turned position
look<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> pops<00:01:05.670> straight

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
look it is and then this pops straight

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
look it is and then this pops straight
up<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> becomes<00:01:06.869> emergency<00:01:07.560> exit<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.790> I'll

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
up and becomes emergency exit so I'll

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
up and becomes emergency exit so I'll
keep<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> latched<00:01:09.510> again<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.560> all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
keep it latched again but it's all

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.219 
keep it latched again but it's all
working<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.280> nothing's<00:01:11.610> missing<00:01:12.020> I'm<00:01:13.020> also

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
going to check my emergency exits which

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
going to check my emergency exits which
are<00:01:16.350> very<00:01:16.439> simple<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.759> check
