blade there's like I mean it's a little

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.450 
blade there's like I mean it's a little
more<00:02:16.650> expensive<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> multicolor<00:02:17.820> g10

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
more expensive to get the multicolor g10

but it just looks so damn good I
couldn't<00:02:24.390> resist<00:02:24.740> micarta<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:26.040> much<00:02:26.430> cheaper

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
couldn't resist micarta is much cheaper

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.310 
couldn't resist micarta is much cheaper
well<00:02:27.210> not<00:02:27.360> much<00:02:27.480> cheaper<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.200> like

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
well not much cheaper I think it's like

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.700

a<00:02:28.350> 380<00:02:29.300> for<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.510> for<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.930> micarta<00:02:31.290> handle<00:02:31.380> you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
a 380 for the for the micarta handle you

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.990 
a 380 for the for the micarta handle you
can<00:02:31.800> get<00:02:31.920> tan<00:02:32.100> or<00:02:32.220> black<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:32.820> whatever

how<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.480> stock<00:03:12.780> edge<00:03:13.550> does<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:14.970> razor<00:03:15.870> sharp

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
how the stock edge does it's razor sharp

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.460 
how the stock edge does it's razor sharp
I<00:03:16.470> mean<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.100> sharpest<00:03:17.700> out<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.570> from

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
I mean it's not the sharpest out of from

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.830 
I mean it's not the sharpest out of from
the<00:03:19.560> factory<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.489> shaves<00:03:21.060> hair<00:03:21.360> with

the factory it's it shaves hair with
slight<00:03:22.110> pressure<00:03:23.150> slices<00:03:24.150> paper<00:03:24.390> easily<00:03:26.780> but

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
slight pressure slices paper easily but

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.840 
slight pressure slices paper easily but
I've<00:03:28.080> seen<00:03:28.380> some<00:03:28.800> unbelievable<00:03:29.580> edges

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
I've seen some unbelievable edges

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.790

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
already be put on these so I might end

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.280 
already be put on these so I might end
up<00:03:35.010> doing<00:03:35.160> something<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.670> eventually

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290
