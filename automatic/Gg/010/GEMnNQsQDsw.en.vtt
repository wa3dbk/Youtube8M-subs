let<00:01:37.740> me<00:01:37.770> focus<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.860> can

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
let me focus in as you can see you can

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609 
let me focus in as you can see you can
actually<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.360> SIM<00:01:42.570> tray<00:01:42.619> goes

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
actually see you where the SIM tray goes

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
actually see you where the SIM tray goes
into<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> logic<00:01:44.369> board<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
into the logic board and there's a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
into the logic board and there's a
little<00:01:45.899> gap<00:01:46.110> over<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little gap over here so what we got to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920 
little gap over here so what we got to
do<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.460> make<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.939> little<00:01:48.420> tool<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
do is actually make a little tool that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080 
do is actually make a little tool that
can<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.799> underneath<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> push<00:01:50.939> our

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
can go up underneath that and push our

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
can go up underneath that and push our
SIM<00:01:51.299> card<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.720> into<00:01:51.960> place<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> tool

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
SIM card back into place and the tool

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.499 
SIM card back into place and the tool
that<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:56.509> this

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that we will use to do that is this

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.230 
that we will use to do that is this
right<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.079> I've<00:01:58.680> already<00:01:58.860> made<00:01:59.070> one

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
right here that I've already made one

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.050 
right here that I've already made one
this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.689> paper<00:02:01.320> clip<00:02:01.560> obviously<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.579> what

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this is a paper clip obviously and what

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.550 
this is a paper clip obviously and what
we<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.299> done<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.140> made<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> little

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
we have done is we have made a little

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.740 
we have done is we have made a little
teeny<00:02:04.860> tiny<00:02:04.950> hook<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> end<00:02:05.640> again<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
teeny tiny hook on the end again it's a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
teeny tiny hook on the end again it's a
small<00:02:06.869> hook<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.469> might<00:02:07.619> look<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:07.890> bit

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
small hook it might look a little bit

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.850 
small hook it might look a little bit
bigger<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.489> film<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.360> yeah<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
bigger on film but yeah it's a it's a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.890 
bigger on film but yeah it's a it's a
really<00:02:11.069> really

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
really really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.679 
really really
hook<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> way<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.700> do<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.360> with

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
hook but the way that we do that is with

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.059 
hook but the way that we do that is with
our<00:02:14.720> pair<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.049> pliers<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.829> want<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
our pair of pliers you want to

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.619 
our pair of pliers you want to
straighten<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.489> out<00:02:16.640> make<00:02:17.269> sure<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
straighten it out make sure that you

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.539 
straighten it out make sure that you
have<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> right<00:02:17.959> size<00:02:18.170> paper<00:02:18.439> clip<00:02:18.709> paper

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
have the right size paper clip paper

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.009 
have the right size paper clip paper
clip<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.909> is<00:02:19.970> too<00:02:20.150> large<00:02:20.360> won't<00:02:20.659> fit<00:02:20.900> in

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
clip that is too large won't fit in

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.390 
clip that is too large won't fit in
underneath<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.680> one<00:02:21.860> that's<00:02:22.069> too<00:02:22.220> small

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
underneath it and one that's too small

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.360 
underneath it and one that's too small
will<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.269> bend<00:02:23.530> when<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.620> try<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:24.799> use<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.189> so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
will just bend when you try to use it so

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.059 
will just bend when you try to use it so
this<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.150> worked<00:02:26.360> great<00:02:26.629> for<00:02:26.659> me<00:02:26.870> all<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.920> do

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
this one worked great for me all you do

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.979 
this one worked great for me all you do
is<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:28.430> grab<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.700> very<00:02:29.120> end<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.659> and<00:02:29.870> then

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
is just grab the very end of it and then

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.890 
is just grab the very end of it and then
make<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.799> tiny<00:02:31.250> hook<00:02:31.579> like<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:33.819> so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
make a little tiny hook like that so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.750 
make a little tiny hook like that so
getting<00:02:35.900> back<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:37.040> what<00:02:37.159> we<00:02:37.340> got<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.640> do

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
getting back to it so what we got to do

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.250 
getting back to it so what we got to do
is<00:02:37.909> we<00:02:38.060> got<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.269> get<00:02:38.359> this<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:38.780> teeny<00:02:39.140> tiny

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
is we got to get this little teeny tiny

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.339 
is we got to get this little teeny tiny
hook<00:02:39.680> up<00:02:40.450> underneath<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.750> sim<00:02:41.989> tray<00:02:44.079> like<00:02:45.079> so

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
hook up underneath the sim tray like so

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.430 
hook up underneath the sim tray like so
once<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:46.970> place<00:02:47.180> once<00:02:48.139> it's<00:02:48.319> all

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
once you have it in place once it's all

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.470 
once you have it in place once it's all
the<00:02:48.560> way<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.069> place<00:02:49.489> then<00:02:50.120> all<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.359> have

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the way in it in place then all you have

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.000 
the way in it in place then all you have
to<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:50.959> kind<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.230> pull<00:02:51.440> back<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.829> this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
to do is just kind of pull back on this

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.559 
to do is just kind of pull back on this
to<00:02:52.129> put<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> little<00:02:52.519> bit<00:02:52.609> of<00:02:52.700> leverage<00:02:52.909> that's

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
to put a little bit of leverage that's

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.240 
to put a little bit of leverage that's
going<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.870> push<00:02:54.019> our<00:02:54.170> sim<00:02:54.379> card<00:02:54.590> back<00:02:54.859> into

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
going to push our sim card back into

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.050 
going to push our sim card back into
place<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.700> if<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.329> pull<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:58.549> might<00:02:58.730> have<00:02:58.909> to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
place and if we pull you might have to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.649 
place and if we pull you might have to
work<00:02:59.239> with<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.689> a<00:02:59.720> little<00:02:59.870> bit<00:03:00.019> but<00:03:01.510> pull<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
work with it a little bit but pull it

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.729 
work with it a little bit but pull it
should<00:03:02.959> release<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:04.840> sim<00:03:05.840> tray<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.470> there

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
should release the sim tray and there

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.460 
should release the sim tray and there
you<00:03:06.799> go<00:03:06.980> voila<00:03:07.760> if<00:03:08.569> we<00:03:08.689> take<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> look<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.379> have

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
you go voila if we take a look we have

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.309 
you go voila if we take a look we have
not<00:03:09.769> damaged<00:03:10.280> anything<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:11.720> sim<00:03:11.900> card<00:03:11.930> might

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
not damaged anything the sim card might

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.530 
not damaged anything the sim card might
be<00:03:12.349> scratched<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:13.069> little<00:03:13.099> bit<00:03:13.430> from<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.000> but

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
be scratched a little bit from that but

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.930 
be scratched a little bit from that but
anyway<00:03:15.379> so<00:03:15.439> what<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.680> did<00:03:15.859> is<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> just<00:03:16.370> it

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
anyway so what that did is it just it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.640 
anyway so what that did is it just it
was<00:03:17.090> kind<00:03:17.419> of<00:03:17.449> sitting<00:03:17.660> upwards<00:03:18.319> like<00:03:18.590> this

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
was kind of sitting upwards like this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.379 
was kind of sitting upwards like this
and<00:03:19.099> then<00:03:19.489> we<00:03:19.579> tried<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.849> pull<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.120> out<00:03:20.209> it's
