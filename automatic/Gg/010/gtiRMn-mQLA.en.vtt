yeah<00:00:03.780> seems<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.230> be<00:00:04.319> drying<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.890> little<00:00:05.220> darker

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
yeah seems to be drying a little darker

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.430 
yeah seems to be drying a little darker
dark<00:00:08.010> brown<00:00:08.990> faded<00:00:09.990> brown<00:00:11.059> anyhow<00:00:12.290> while<00:00:13.290> I'm

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
dark brown faded brown anyhow while I'm

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.870 
dark brown faded brown anyhow while I'm
waiting<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> dry<00:00:14.130> before<00:00:14.700> I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
waiting for that to dry before I

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400 
waiting for that to dry before I
sandblast<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> other<00:00:15.750> side<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> thought<00:00:16.379> I

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
sandblast the other side I thought I

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
sandblast the other side I thought I
think<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> peek<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.220> plastic<00:00:17.880> snow<00:00:18.180> blower

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
think a peek at this plastic snow blower

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.340 
think a peek at this plastic snow blower
I<00:00:19.880> was<00:00:20.880> playing<00:00:21.180> around<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.779> control

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
I was playing around with the control

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.359 
I was playing around with the control
that<00:00:22.560> moves<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.330> shoot<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> plastic<00:00:25.019> shoot

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
that moves the shoot the plastic shoot

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
that moves the shoot the plastic shoot
and<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> wouldn't<00:00:26.640> work<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.410> full

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and it wouldn't work so it was all full

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
and it wouldn't work so it was all full
of<00:00:28.740> white<00:00:28.890> grease<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:29.880> hardened

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
of white grease so it was all hardened

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.880 
of white grease so it was all hardened
up<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.570> old<00:00:30.720> masking<00:00:31.230> tape<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.590> sprayed<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
up like old masking tape so I sprayed it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.110 
up like old masking tape so I sprayed it
with<00:00:32.009> silicone<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> started<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> work<00:00:32.940> really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
with silicone it started to work really

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760 
with silicone it started to work really
well<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> flicked<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.110> little<00:00:34.410> too<00:00:34.530> fast

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
well so I flicked this little too fast

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.600 
well so I flicked this little too fast
and<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> pop<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.300> cable<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and I pop this cable right off the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
and I pop this cable right off the
pulley<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> figured<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.500> how<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
pulley so I figured out how to take it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.240 
pulley so I figured out how to take it
apart<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.960> jacket<00:00:42.960> crank<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> pan

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
apart to get a jacket crank it to pan

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.560 
apart to get a jacket crank it to pan
out<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> pin<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.719> goes<00:00:45.780> through<00:00:46.289> their

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
out it was a pin that goes through their

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
out it was a pin that goes through their
pin<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> took<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.809> apart<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> realized<00:00:52.860> how

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
pin so took it apart and I realized how

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
pin so took it apart and I realized how
it<00:00:53.399> worked<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.910> slide<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.860> rotating<00:00:55.860> thing

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it worked is slide this rotating thing

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010 
it worked is slide this rotating thing
off<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> wrap<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> cable<00:00:57.329> around<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
off and you wrap the cable around it a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
off and you wrap the cable around it a
couple<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> times<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> cable

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
couple of times and that's how the cable

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.029 
couple of times and that's how the cable
was<00:01:00.660> loose<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.620> i<00:01:01.680> took<00:01:01.739> some

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
was loose over here so i took some

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.230 
was loose over here so i took some
wrenches<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> i<00:01:04.260> took<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> slack<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
wrenches and i took the slack of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
wrenches and i took the slack of the
cable<00:01:06.510> should<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.310> loose<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> little

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
cable should just be loose just a little

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
cable should just be loose just a little
bit<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.720> got<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> silicone<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> can't<00:01:11.369> use

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
bit then you got a silicone it can't use

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
bit then you got a silicone it can't use
grease<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.240> attracts<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.320> some

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
grease because it attracts and from some

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890 
grease because it attracts and from some
