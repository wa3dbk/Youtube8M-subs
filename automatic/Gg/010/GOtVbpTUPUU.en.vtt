00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.700
 load stability test 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.340
 held in extreme at them 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.010
 characteristic of normal driving 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.940
 conditions only so we can make sure 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.519
 abilities Moscow will save workers 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580
 characteristics for any driving style 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.330
 suppose the driver has pressed proven 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.940
 gas pedals and kept her in such 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 position continuously for six days 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.650
 while the author worked on 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.230
 maximum speed 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.260
 in such extreme 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.710
 conditions oil film formed 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.710
 the nearest competitor bridge 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.169
 collapsed and 90 3 hours with disastrous 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.660
 consequences for the engine 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.130
 and then how did castrol edge oil retain 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.890
 exceptional durability for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.760
 one hundred forty eight hours defending 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.970
 engine at maximum speed 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.150
 almost for 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.930
 owl 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.110
 start some castrol oil 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.290
 shoulders can work with continuously in 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.020
 for one week in maximum mode 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.860
 power 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380
 in such conditions, the probability is high 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.180
 engine overheat formation in it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.000
 deposits and rapid wear of parts 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.230
 she is often an interesting fact is 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.780
 that many components of cars such as 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.260
 tires transmission Muscovites do not 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
 stand such tests and 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.630
 require regular replace resist 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.780
 while the engine continues 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.240
 run smoothly background 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.070
 stood out against the background so it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 ending so this test 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.300
 important for evaluating oil performance in 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.790
 similar conditions 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.520
 France 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.400
 castrol edge oil possess the following 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.740
 benefits 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.930
 maximum maximum efficient operation 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.509
 engine throughout 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.650
 service life 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.880
 with increasing engine uptime 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.990
 even when operating the limit mode 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.840
 loads 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.740
 engine performance with maximum efficiency 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.740
 by reducing the amount of sediment 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.670
 unsurpassed level of part protection 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.310
 engine in any road and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.600
 temperature conditions 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.710
 we got exceptional 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.930
 performance indicators which test 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.590
 conformance tests 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 industry standards on this 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.640
 confined we present more 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.340
 high demands on our products and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.670
 will develop great 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.470
 and test methods to bring up 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.359
 perfect 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.580
 tests relate to how effective 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.730
 these selected base oils are responding to 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.760
 change in sharpening pressure and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 so and the composition of special additives 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.030
 designed for changing 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.980
 pressure and temperature they 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.050
 create a protective film notes 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.510
 contact area 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.540
 metal surfaces and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.149
 prevent parts wear 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.739
 we want to ask you all once 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.669
 what oil has ethics 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.219
 will be so these motor oil castrol edge 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.869
 make the perfect decision 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.989
 motivated compromise 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.810
 castrol edge allows you to fully 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.769
 realize development potential and 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.700
 experience really strong 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.889
 driving emotions 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.499
 using castrol edge you can be sure 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.239
 that the engine will run at peak 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.309
 opportunities in any conditions when you 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.309
 it's necessary 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.239
 castrol max speech 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.429
 efficiency even in extreme 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.979
 conditions
