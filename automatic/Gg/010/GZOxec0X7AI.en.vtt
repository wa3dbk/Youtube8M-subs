00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:23.749 
it's not sure enough then it's going to

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.200 
it's not sure enough then it's going to
be<00:00:23.839> sticking<00:00:24.230> out<00:00:24.349> underneath<00:00:24.829> the<00:00:25.009> tie<00:00:25.789> when

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
really short this sides longer and

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.380 
really short this sides longer and
you're<00:00:31.369> just<00:00:31.519> going<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.880> start<00:00:32.060> off<00:00:32.149> with<00:00:32.329> a

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
you're just going to start off with a

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.740 
you're just going to start off with a
skinny<00:00:33.040> underneath<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.580> fat<00:00:34.880> end<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.510> you're

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
skinny underneath the fat end and you're

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.900 
skinny underneath the fat end and you're
just<00:00:35.840> going<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.170> wrap<00:00:36.380> that<00:00:36.590> fat<00:00:36.920> end<00:00:37.190> all<00:00:37.490> the

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
just going to wrap that fat end all the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.460 
just going to wrap that fat end all the
way<00:00:38.030> around<00:00:38.740> and<00:00:40.390> pull<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:41.420> straight<00:00:41.990> across

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
way around and pull it straight across

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.620 
way around and pull it straight across
like<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:43.670> not<00:00:43.790> on<00:00:43.970> an<00:00:44.120> angle<00:00:44.420> down

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
like this so it's not on an angle down

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.400 
like this so it's not on an angle down
or<00:00:44.960> an<00:00:45.020> angle<00:00:45.380> up<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:45.740> it's<00:00:45.860> straight<00:00:46.040> across

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
or an angle up so it's straight across

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.160 
or an angle up so it's straight across
now<00:00:48.410> at<00:00:48.560> this<00:00:48.710> point<00:00:49.010> you're<00:00:49.820> going<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.170> pull

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
now at this point you're going to pull

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.400 
now at this point you're going to pull
it<00:00:51.290> underneath<00:00:52.900> I'm<00:00:53.900> going<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.140> put<00:00:54.320> it

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
it underneath I'm going to put it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.060 
it underneath I'm going to put it
through<00:00:54.680> that<00:00:54.860> top<00:00:55.250> space<00:00:56.020> all<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.950> way

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
through that top space all the way

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.420 
through that top space all the way
through<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.380> by<00:01:00.380> doing<00:01:00.620> that<00:01:00.800> we're<00:01:01.220> creating

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
through and by doing that we're creating

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.320 
through and by doing that we're creating
a<00:01:01.970> loop<00:01:03.760> right<00:01:04.760> here<00:01:05.980> gonna<00:01:06.980> wanna<00:01:07.460> put<00:01:08.300> that

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
a loop right here gonna wanna put that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.250 
a loop right here gonna wanna put that
fat<00:01:08.810> right<00:01:09.590> through<00:01:10.040> that<00:01:10.070> loop<00:01:12.310> and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
fat right through that loop and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.860 
fat right through that loop and
throughout<00:01:15.260> all<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:17.420> want<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.720> make

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870
