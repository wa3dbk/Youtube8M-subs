00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
moss for summertime another thing to be

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.360 
moss for summertime another thing to be
sure<00:00:52.060> of<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.540> wherever<00:00:53.500> you<00:00:54.010> want<00:00:54.250> to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
sure of is that wherever you want to

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.470 
sure of is that wherever you want to
grow<00:00:54.520> your<00:00:54.670> mom's<00:00:54.880> you<00:00:55.030> have<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.300> make<00:00:55.450> sure

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
grow your mom's you have to make sure

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.200 
grow your mom's you have to make sure
that<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:55.990> is<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:56.650> maybe<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.070> shaded<00:00:57.580> area<00:00:57.730> or

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
that it is in maybe a shaded area or

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.960 
that it is in maybe a shaded area or
it's<00:00:58.900> damp<00:00:59.230> all<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.680> time<00:00:59.890> because<00:01:00.160> moss

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
it's damp all the time because moss

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's damp all the time because moss
thrives<00:01:01.390> on<00:01:01.690> moisture<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:03.070> that's<00:01:03.220> one<00:01:03.400> thing

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
thrives on moisture so that's one thing

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.070 
thrives on moisture so that's one thing
you<00:01:03.580> have<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.790> realize<00:01:04.000> it's<00:01:04.600> something<00:01:04.930> that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
you have to realize it's something that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.870 
you have to realize it's something that
will<00:01:05.259> take<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.950> lot<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.400> water<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:08.350> as<00:01:09.070> well<00:01:09.759> as

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
will take a lot of water in as well as

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.529 
will take a lot of water in as well as
out<00:01:10.119> you<00:01:11.020> can<00:01:11.170> actually<00:01:11.320> flood<00:01:11.890> your<00:01:12.670> moss<00:01:13.210> and

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
out you can actually flood your moss and

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.209 
out you can actually flood your moss and
it<00:01:13.630> will<00:01:13.780> still<00:01:14.049> be<00:01:14.079> okay<00:01:14.469> will<00:01:14.649> be<00:01:14.829> all<00:01:14.920> green

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
it will still be okay will be all green

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.620 
it will still be okay will be all green
so

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
so

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.020 
so
yeah<00:01:17.290> there<00:01:18.189> are<00:01:18.250> different<00:01:18.520> kinds<00:01:18.790> of<00:01:18.850> moss

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
yeah there are different kinds of moss

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
then this one there's a highly thicker

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.980 
then this one there's a highly thicker
