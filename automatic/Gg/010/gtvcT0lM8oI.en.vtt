wise it's got a maximum damage of 30 and
it's<00:00:24.560> got<00:00:24.949> a<00:00:25.130> rate<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.519> fire<00:00:25.939> of<00:00:25.970> around<00:00:26.390> nine

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
it's got a rate of fire of around nine

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.249 
it's got a rate of fire of around nine
fifty<00:00:27.699> but<00:00:28.699> it's<00:00:28.849> only<00:00:29.029> got<00:00:29.210> 21<00:00:29.689> shots<00:00:29.990> in<00:00:30.169> a

shots<00:00:39.500> through<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.190> doorway<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.110> don't

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
shots through that doorway and don't

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.680 
shots through that doorway and don't
reload<00:00:42.560> because<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.850> know<00:00:43.970> I<00:00:44.180> only<00:00:44.450> fired<00:00:44.630> a

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
reload because you know I only fired a

reload because you know I only fired a
few<00:00:44.810> shots<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:46.340> problem<00:00:46.700> is<00:00:46.850> with<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.090> gun

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
few shots the problem is with this gun

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.380 
few shots the problem is with this gun
fires<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.110> fast<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:48.920> little<00:00:49.250> ammo<00:00:49.400> that

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
fires so fast that's so little ammo that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.660 
fires so fast that's so little ammo that
you<00:00:50.720> don't<00:00:51.260> realize<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.190> you've<00:00:52.490> just

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
you don't realize that you've just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.530 
you don't realize that you've just
burned<00:00:53.000> through<00:00:53.390> most<00:00:53.990> of<00:00:54.140> your<00:00:54.290> magazine<00:00:55.540> so

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
burned through most of your magazine so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.890 
burned through most of your magazine so
it's<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.440> bit<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:57.740> a<00:00:58.010> new<00:00:58.400> curve<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.690> learn<00:00:59.870> how

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
it's a bit of a new curve to learn how

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.999 
it's a bit of a new curve to learn how
to<00:01:00.140> use<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.680> thing<00:01:01.510> now<00:01:02.510> it's<00:01:03.009> major

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
to use this thing now it's major

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.060 
to use this thing now it's major
benefits<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:05.000> fire<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:06.170> really<00:01:06.619> good<00:01:06.950> at

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
benefits it fire it's really good at

option<00:01:14.299> like<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.990> was<00:01:15.109> in<00:01:15.320> battlefield<00:01:15.770> 3<00:01:15.859> in

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
fact field for for some reason this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.370 
fact field for for some reason this
thing<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> PDW<00:01:19.780> even<00:01:20.780> though<00:01:20.869> in<00:01:20.929> real<00:01:21.140> life

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
thing is a PDW even though in real life

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.859 
thing is a PDW even though in real life
it's<00:01:21.590> an<00:01:21.710> assault<00:01:21.979> rifle<00:01:22.069> and<00:01:22.670> maybe<00:01:23.539> could

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
it's an assault rifle and maybe could

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.559 
it's an assault rifle and maybe could
have<00:01:23.960> gone<00:01:24.079> in<00:01:24.170> as<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.350> carbine<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.789> with<00:01:26.420> it

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
have gone in as a carbine but with it

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.859 
have gone in as a carbine but with it
being<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.810> PDW<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.799> follows<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.670> PDW<00:01:29.390> damage

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
being a PDW it follows the PDW damage

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.389 
being a PDW it follows the PDW damage
drop-off<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.619> range<00:01:31.159> models<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.740> lost<00:01:34.219> a

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
drop-off and range models so it's lost a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.129 
drop-off and range models so it's lost a
lot<00:01:34.609> of<00:01:34.639> its<00:01:34.850> utility<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.719> used<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.990> have

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
lot of its utility that it used to have

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:39.429 
lot of its utility that it used to have
in<00:01:36.319> battlefield<00:01:36.829> 3<00:01:38.049> another<00:01:39.049> thing<00:01:39.289> it's

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
in battlefield 3 another thing it's

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.639 
in battlefield 3 another thing it's
developed<00:01:39.859> in<00:01:40.130> battlefield<00:01:40.729> 4<00:01:40.819> is<00:01:41.649> monstrous

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
developed in battlefield 4 is monstrous

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.260 
developed in battlefield 4 is monstrous
recoil<00:01:43.189> even<00:01:43.579> in<00:01:43.700> burst<00:01:43.999> mode<00:01:45.399> if<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.729> fire<00:01:47.030> a

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
recoil even in burst mode if you fire a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.940 
recoil even in burst mode if you fire a
three-shot<00:01:47.780> burst<00:01:48.049> of<00:01:48.229> somebody<00:01:48.649> you're

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
three-shot burst of somebody you're

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.469 
three-shot burst of somebody you're
probably<00:01:49.310> going<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.609> hit<00:01:49.789> them<00:01:49.969> with<00:01:50.119> one<00:01:50.359> of

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
probably going to hit them with one of

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.690 
probably going to hit them with one of
those<00:01:50.600> shots<00:01:51.130> range<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:53.289> just<00:01:54.700> appalling

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
those shots range it is just appalling

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.530 
those shots range it is just appalling
in<00:01:56.030> my<00:01:56.209> opinion

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
in my opinion

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.900 
in my opinion
it's<00:01:58.500> lost<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.430> lot<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.730> its<00:02:00.060> abilities<00:02:00.900> and

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
it's lost a lot of its abilities and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.400 
it's lost a lot of its abilities and
maybe<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:03.090> rains<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.050> be<00:02:04.140> better

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
maybe it rains it's going to be better

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.180 
maybe it rains it's going to be better
in<00:02:04.710> single<00:02:05.190> shot<00:02:05.490> than<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.530> trying<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.800> tap

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
in single shot than it is trying to tap

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
in single shot than it is trying to tap
fire<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.479> battlefield

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
fire it but you could do in battlefield

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.580 
fire it but you could do in battlefield
3<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.910> probably<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.390> gun<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.990> crying<00:02:13.410> out

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
3 it's probably a gun that's crying out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.480 
3 it's probably a gun that's crying out
for<00:02:13.770> an<00:02:13.860> angle<00:02:14.130> grip<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:15.240> suspect

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
for an angle grip I would suspect

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.270 
for an angle grip I would suspect
because<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.390> kicks<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.130> third

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
because it just kicks up on the third

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.430 
because it just kicks up on the third
shot<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> second<00:02:21.480> shot<00:02:21.630> doesn't<00:02:21.990> go<00:02:22.140> in

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
shot and the second shot doesn't go in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.230 
shot and the second shot doesn't go in
exactly<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> same<00:02:22.980> place<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.610> first<00:02:23.970> like

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
exactly the same place as the first like

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
it used to in bf3 so yeah this is now a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.640 
it used to in bf3 so yeah this is now a
closed<00:02:29.130> medium<00:02:29.730> range<00:02:30.000> gun<00:02:30.440> rather<00:02:31.440> than

closed medium range gun rather than

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.070 
closed medium range gun rather than
being<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.130> utilitarian<00:02:32.940> gun<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:33.930> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
being a utilitarian gun that it was in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.970 
being a utilitarian gun that it was in
battlefield<00:02:34.590> 3<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.870> while<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.410> 30<00:02:37.650> max

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.160 
battlefield 3 and while the 30 max
damage<00:02:38.250> sounds<00:02:38.820> impressive<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.020> in

close<00:02:40.410> range<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:42.120> range<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:43.350> not<00:02:44.100> because

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
close range but range it's not because

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.970 
close range but range it's not because
30<00:02:45.750> damage<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.560> still<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.490> four-shot<00:02:48.000> kill<00:02:48.980> when

30 damage is still a four-shot kill when

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.500 
30 damage is still a four-shot kill when

different model of gun and I've got the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.170 
different model of gun and I've got the
hang<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.500> reloading<00:03:53.890> every<00:03:54.610> time<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.970> stopped

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
hang of reloading every time you stopped

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.820 
hang of reloading every time you stopped
firing<00:03:55.260> reload<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:57.010> can<00:03:57.310> get<00:03:57.490> away<00:03:57.550> with<00:03:57.850> it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.520 
firing reload you can get away with it
but<00:03:59.830> it's<00:04:01.140> just<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:03.000> strange<00:04:04.000> gun<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.350> take

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
but it's just a strange gun so I take

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.040 
but it's just a strange gun so I take
that<00:04:05.680> guy<00:04:05.800> down<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:07.300> I<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.600> don't<00:04:07.900> have

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
that guy down and I just don't have

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.450 
that guy down and I just don't have
enough<00:04:08.170> rounds<00:04:08.440> left<00:04:08.710> take<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.460> next<00:04:09.640> one<00:04:11.460> so

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
enough rounds left take the next one so

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.630 
enough rounds left take the next one so
here<00:04:12.820> is<00:04:12.970> how<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.150> think<00:04:13.480> das<00:04:13.870> file<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:15.190> be<00:04:15.220> used

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
here is how I think das file can be used

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.789 
here is how I think das file can be used
and<00:04:16.090> this<00:04:16.450> is<00:04:16.630> completely<00:04:16.989> Baxter<00:04:17.560> I'm

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
back now there's another option is worth

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.820 
back now there's another option is worth
considering<00:04:24.640> when<00:04:25.360> you're<00:04:25.480> on<00:04:25.510> 20<00:04:25.840> rounds<00:04:26.170> but

an interesting problem i found with it

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.720 
an interesting problem i found with it
is<00:04:40.290> yes<00:04:41.290> five<00:04:41.650> shots<00:04:42.130> is<00:04:42.310> going<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.550> kill

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
fire so fast by the time they've

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.390 
fire so fast by the time they've
actually<00:04:48.880> died<00:04:49.420> you've<00:04:50.110> fired<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.950> lot<00:04:51.160> more

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
actually died you've fired a lot more

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.720 
actually died you've fired a lot more
than<00:04:51.700> that<00:04:52.330> many<00:04:52.690> shots<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.680> I'm<00:04:53.950> you<00:04:54.100> realize

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
than that many shots but I'm you realize

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.160 
than that many shots but I'm you realize
that<00:04:54.760> they're<00:04:55.150> dead<00:04:55.420> from<00:04:55.660> watching<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
that they're dead from watching the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.230 
that they're dead from watching the
animation<00:04:57.750> they've<00:04:58.750> gone<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.790> he<00:05:00.790> noticed

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
animation they've gone and he noticed

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.990 
animation they've gone and he noticed
just<00:05:01.450> how<00:05:01.690> quickly<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:03.190> burnt<00:05:03.490> through<00:05:03.700> all

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
just how quickly and burnt through all

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.080 
just how quickly and burnt through all
my<00:05:04.210> ammunition<00:05:04.480> that<00:05:05.460> because<00:05:06.460> it's<00:05:06.820> a

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
my ammunition that because it's a

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.380 
my ammunition that because it's a
strange<00:05:07.390> good<00:05:07.660> do<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:07.870> rely<00:05:08.290> on<00:05:09.150> firing<00:05:10.150> five

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
strange good do you rely on firing five

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.410 
strange good do you rely on firing five
shots<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.780> killing<00:05:11.110> them<00:05:11.430> or<00:05:12.430> do<00:05:12.700> you<00:05:12.820> rely<00:05:13.090> on

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
shots and killing them or do you rely on

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.480 
shots and killing them or do you rely on
waiting<00:05:13.870> until<00:05:14.020> they're<00:05:14.410> dead<00:05:14.590> now<00:05:14.860> there's

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
waiting until they're dead now there's

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.610 
waiting until they're dead now there's
an<00:05:15.610> example<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:16.180> how<00:05:16.390> this<00:05:16.630> Gooden<00:05:17.080> dominates

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
an example of how this Gooden dominates

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.920 
an example of how this Gooden dominates
going<00:05:18.370> round<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.610> corner<00:05:19.060> that's<00:05:19.780> very

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
going round the corner that's very

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.770 
going round the corner that's very
little<00:05:20.380> that's<00:05:20.470> going<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.770> stand<00:05:21.010> up<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.190> it

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
little that's going to stand up to it

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.910 
little that's going to stand up to it
and<00:05:22.500> now<00:05:22.860> you<00:05:22.920> can<00:05:23.160> see<00:05:23.960> he<00:05:24.960> shot<00:05:25.230> first<00:05:25.440> but<00:05:25.889> I

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
and now you can see he shot first but I

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.390 
and now you can see he shot first but I
still<00:05:26.190> took<00:05:26.400> him<00:05:26.550> out<00:05:26.700> with<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:26.940> AES<00:05:27.210> valve

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
still took him out with the AES valve

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.020 
still took him out with the AES valve
that<00:05:29.400> one<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.730> have<00:05:29.970> no<00:05:30.120> idea<00:05:30.150> how<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.660> missed<00:05:32.030> so

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
that one I have no idea how I missed so

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.680 
that one I have no idea how I missed so
the<00:05:33.180> AS<00:05:33.360> VAL<00:05:33.690> it's<00:05:34.169> not<00:05:34.740> what<00:05:34.980> it<00:05:35.010> was

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
the AS VAL it's not what it was

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
the AS VAL it's not what it was
everybody<00:05:36.690> who<00:05:36.840> was<00:05:36.930> looking<00:05:37.080> forward<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> it

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
everybody who was looking forward to it

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.290 
everybody who was looking forward to it
coming<00:05:38.010> back<00:05:38.220> he's<00:05:38.639> going<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.210> be

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
coming back he's going to be

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.560 
coming back he's going to be
disappointed<00:05:39.480> I<00:05:40.080> think<00:05:40.350> because<00:05:41.040> it's<00:05:41.520> a<00:05:41.790> pale

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
disappointed I think because it's a pale

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.300 
disappointed I think because it's a pale
imitation<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:43.470> what<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:43.710> used<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.040> be<00:05:44.070> in

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
imitation of what it used to be in

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.840 
imitation of what it used to be in
battlefield<00:05:44.760> 3<00:05:45.889> this<00:05:46.889> gun<00:05:47.130> was<00:05:47.280> crying<00:05:47.669> out<00:05:47.790> to

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
battlefield 3 this gun was crying out to

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.879 
battlefield 3 this gun was crying out to
be<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> carbine<00:05:48.630> in<00:05:48.810> battlefield<00:05:49.260> 4<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:49.830> you

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
be a carbine in battlefield 4 so you

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.460 
be a carbine in battlefield 4 so you
could<00:05:50.040> use<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.220> on<00:05:50.430> all<00:05:50.520> classes<00:05:51.060> but<00:05:51.990> instead

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
could use it on all classes but instead

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.400 
could use it on all classes but instead
it's<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:53.010> PDW<00:05:53.370> so<00:05:54.210> it's<00:05:54.360> limited<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.810> engineers

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
it's a PDW so it's limited to engineers

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.710 
it's a PDW so it's limited to engineers
and<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:56.700> be<00:05:56.850> honest<00:05:57.150> there<00:05:57.390> are<00:05:57.419> better

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
and to be honest there are better

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.260 
and to be honest there are better
choices<00:05:57.840> of<00:05:58.410> PDW<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.490> carbine<00:05:59.970> for<00:06:00.210> the

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
choices of PDW and carbine for the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.630 
choices of PDW and carbine for the
engineer<00:06:00.800> all<00:06:01.800> of<00:06:02.010> which<00:06:02.190> can<00:06:02.400> take<00:06:02.580> a

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
engineer all of which can take a

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.820 
engineer all of which can take a
silencer<00:06:03.300> with<00:06:03.480> very<00:06:03.840> little<00:06:04.050> penalty<00:06:04.650> and

silencer with very little penalty and

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.370 
silencer with very little penalty and
they<00:06:05.460> can<00:06:05.610> also<00:06:05.760> take<00:06:06.270> both<00:06:06.870> of<00:06:06.900> barrel

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
they can also take both of barrel

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.560 
they can also take both of barrel
options<00:06:07.800> so<00:06:08.790> what<00:06:08.970> guns<00:06:09.180> are<00:06:09.270> going<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.480> be

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
options so what guns are going to be

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.430 
options so what guns are going to be
better<00:06:09.870> than<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.290> is<00:06:10.560> foul<00:06:10.830> for<00:06:11.070> the<00:06:11.100> engineer

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
better than the is foul for the engineer

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.350 
better than the is foul for the engineer
so<00:06:13.440> for<00:06:13.650> pure<00:06:13.860> close-range<00:06:14.490> killing<00:06:14.910> power<00:06:15.120> we

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
have the season 3 a 1 now this does 25

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.040 
have the season 3 a 1 now this does 25
damage<00:06:19.080> rather<00:06:19.350> than<00:06:19.500> 30<00:06:19.830> but<00:06:20.820> 25<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:21.750> 30

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.560 
damage rather than 30 but 25 and 30
damage<00:06:22.380> are<00:06:22.740> both<00:06:22.950> poor<00:06:23.280> shot<00:06:23.580> kills<00:06:23.910> close<00:06:24.330> up

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
damage are both poor shot kills close up

31<00:06:36.540> rounds<00:06:36.990> in<00:06:37.080> a<00:06:37.140> magazine<00:06:37.350> not<00:06:37.830> 21<00:06:38.280> and<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:39.630> in

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
31 rounds in a magazine not 21 and so in

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.140 
31 rounds in a magazine not 21 and so in
my<00:06:40.020> opinion<00:06:40.169> this<00:06:40.860> is<00:06:40.919> a<00:06:41.100> better<00:06:41.430> gunner<00:06:41.820> than

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
my opinion this is a better gunner than

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.450 
my opinion this is a better gunner than
the<00:06:42.270> AS<00:06:42.539> VAL<00:06:42.870> as<00:06:43.140> a<00:06:43.590> PDW<00:06:44.100> for<00:06:44.700> close<00:06:44.940> range<00:06:46.460> but

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
the AS VAL as a PDW for close range but

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.310 
the AS VAL as a PDW for close range but
for<00:06:47.640> an<00:06:47.700> all-round<00:06:48.120> gun<00:06:48.419> my<00:06:48.690> option<00:06:49.080> is<00:06:49.200> the

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
for an all-round gun my option is the

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.060 
for an all-round gun my option is the
ace<00:06:49.440> 52<00:06:49.680> c<00:06:50.220> QV<00:06:50.580> at<00:06:51.330> close<00:06:51.600> range<00:06:51.930> this<00:06:52.229> does<00:06:52.410> 34

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
ace 52 c QV at close range this does 34

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.190 
ace 52 c QV at close range this does 34
damage<00:06:53.550> so<00:06:53.760> it's<00:06:53.910> a<00:06:54.000> three<00:06:54.300> shot<00:06:54.570> kill<00:06:54.930> a

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
damage so it's a three shot kill a

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.830 
damage so it's a three shot kill a
long-range<00:06:56.039> it<00:06:56.280> drops<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:56.580> 20<00:06:57.180> so<00:06:57.419> it's<00:06:57.539> a<00:06:57.570> five

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
long-range it drops to 20 so it's a five

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.090 
long-range it drops to 20 so it's a five
shot<00:06:57.870> kill<00:06:58.440> and<00:06:58.650> its<00:06:59.720> damage<00:07:00.720> profile<00:07:01.289> is<00:07:01.560> much

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
shot kill and its damage profile is much

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.520 
shot kill and its damage profile is much
better<00:07:02.430> than<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.820> AS<00:07:03.120> VAL<00:07:03.450> for<00:07:03.870> general<00:07:04.500> use

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
better than the AS VAL for general use

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.460 
better than the AS VAL for general use
on<00:07:05.430> most<00:07:06.060> maps<00:07:06.390> is<00:07:06.810> that<00:07:07.140> you're<00:07:07.260> going<00:07:07.350> to<00:07:07.410> be

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
on most maps is that you're going to be

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.440 
on most maps is that you're going to be
an<00:07:07.650> engineer<00:07:07.890> you're<00:07:08.610> gonna<00:07:08.820> want<00:07:09.120> a<00:07:09.210> bit<00:07:09.419> of

an engineer you're gonna want a bit of

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.230 
an engineer you're gonna want a bit of
range<00:07:09.840> and<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.440> ace<00:07:10.560> 52<00:07:10.800> provides<00:07:11.610> that<00:07:11.820> wit

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
range and the ace 52 provides that wit

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.620 
range and the ace 52 provides that wit
close-range<00:07:12.510> stopping<00:07:13.260> power<00:07:14.270> so<00:07:15.270> that's<00:07:15.479> my

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
close-range stopping power so that's my

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.870 
close-range stopping power so that's my
look<00:07:15.840> at<00:07:15.960> the<00:07:16.050> AS<00:07:16.289> VAL<00:07:16.590> a<00:07:16.860> once-great<00:07:17.370> gun
